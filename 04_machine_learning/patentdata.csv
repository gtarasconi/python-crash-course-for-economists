1999,"The system for automatically routing calls to call center agents in an agent surplus condition provides the call center administrator with an automatic agent assignment paradigm which functions to automatically increase the efficiency of assigning multiple skill agents to contacts. The presence of an agent surplus condition provides the present system with a plurality of choices in the assignment of the agent to process a presently received contact. Since the agents who staff the call center include multiple skill agents, the system must make a determination of not only which of the available agents is the best equipped to handle the present contact, but also how that assignment statistically effects the efficiency of successive assignments of agents to contacts next received, based upon the past performance of the agents and the call center. Since the traffic load presented to the call center tends to be highly variable and of content that is difficult to predict, the present system provides several automatic agent assignment paradigms that each have a statistically different impact on the performance of the call center, based upon the quality and quantity of the incoming calls. <IMAGE>","AVAYA TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION","H04L"

The method for producing a multi-axial wire structure in the form of an endless web, which is present in a transport device and moves itself with the transport device in its longitudinal direction, comprises broadening the fibers in an expanding process before displacing to unidirectional fiber layers, where each fiber is deformed to a strip, whose weight per unit area is highly 300 g/m 2>, consecutively placing the unidirectional fiber layers with their fibers in the form of individual segments (5), which lie next to each other and consist of strips (3a, 3b), in alternating longitudinal direction by using a laying device, and temporarily fixing the unidirectional fiber layers at the transport device, where the longitudinal direction of the strips and the segments runs at an angle to the longitudinal direction of the resulting web-like wire structure. The raw material of the unidirectional fiber layers are made of fibers consisting of filaments, where the fibers are provided with a size. A transverse coherence is given to the individual strips in a manner before joining to the segments. The strips that closely lie next to each other remain within the segment in an unbondable manner. The segments pass through the entire placing process in an unbondable condition of the strip in the segment. Coherence takes place between the strips and between the segments of the different unidirectional fiber layers by temporarily fixing at the transport device. During placing process, a gripper (6) of the laying device pulls the strips over the transport device transverse to the formation of the segments. An equalization of different mechanical longitudinal stresses between the individual strips takes place in co-operation between the traction force of the gripper and the restoring force of the strips. The adhesion effect of the size between the filaments of the fibers and/or strips is reduced by targeted effect on the fibers and/or strips. The already broadened fibers are provided as finished intermediate product on disk coils, are removed by a wrap creel and are led to the gripper. A defined slippage of the strips is provided in the gripper and the ends of the segments turned away to the gripper are fixed into a clamping device (8) during the equalization of the different mechanical longitudinal stresses of all strips. The already expanded fibers of the finished intermediate product are provided on a common coil body of the disk coils, on which two already expanded fibers are winded next to each other. The broadening of the fibers takes place in a multi-axial machine for the production of the multi-axial wire structure. The fibers removed by the wrap creel pass through a stationarily arranged spreading unit and are led into the gripper in the form of broadened strips. All strips are fixed into the gripper during the equalization of the different mechanical longitudinal stresses and the restoring force of the strip is introduced by the coils of the wrap creel and to the spreading unit. The wrap creel is controllably moved together with the spreading unit as a common structural unit in a way, where the distance (L) is targetedly changed between the common structural unit and the laying device. The movement of the structural unit takes place at the strips in accordance with the requirement of the laying device varying in the unit of time, so that the fibers pass through the spreading unit with constant speed. The ends of the segments are fixed into the gripper for the equalization of the different mechanical longitudinal stresses of the individual strips. The segments are placed next to each other in a gas-free manner or are placed with an overlap or with a distance to each other. The targeted effects are mechanically, thermally or chemically carried out before, during or after the spreading. A cohesion medium is introduced before placing the segments on the fiber layers, is thermally activated after placing the segments and binds the fiber layers with one another. The adjacent strips are placed in a gas-free manner, placed with the overlap or placed spatially apart from each other. The transport device is a movable carrier, which is textile layer of the wire structure. After placing all the unidirectional fiber layers, the multi-axial wire structure is supplied to a connecting station, in which all fiber layers are sutured with one another, knitted or calendared. The transport device consists of conveyor chains, which shortly and slightly diverge transverse to its transport direction before fixing the layers. Each of the fibers is separately spreaded.

The materials condense as a result of a temperature gradient on a substrate forming a doped matrix, where the doping occurs by modification of a starting material during its transport. The starting material does not develop a doping effect without modification. The method for producing doped layers for electronic, luminescent or photovoltaic components e.g. organic light emitting diodes, comprises evaporating liquid or solid starting materials in a source or admixing the materials as aerosol to a carrier gas and then transporting the materials into a deposition chamber (1). The materials condense as a result of a temperature gradient on a substrate forming a doped matrix, where the doping occurs by modification of a starting material during its transport. The starting material does not develop a doping effect without modification. The modification of the starting material occurs away from the substrate in the presence of carrier gas, and takes place in modification chambers (21, 22, 23, 24), which are disposed downstream of the source and upstream of the deposition chamber. The modification is a molecular change, which is caused by a supply of energy and/or physical or chemical reaction partners. The energy is supplied by a plasma, radio-frequency (RF) excitation or heat, where the plasma is generated by a direct current (DC) voltage plasma generator or an alternating current (AC) voltage plasma generator. The doping or dopant is generated by modification of the starting material forming the matrix. A kinetic energy of ions generated by the modification is influenced by electrostatic fields. The dopant formed by the modification comprises neutral radicals. A precursor of the dopant is converted into a dopant in the modification chamber. A growth of the layers is influenced by a breakdown of starting materials prior to entering the deposition chamber, where the starting materials are broken down by plasma. By activating and deactivating the energy supply e.g. plasma, the layer growth is stopped and started. An independent claim is included for a device for depositing doped layers for organic light emitting diodes.","AIXTRON SE","B05D"

2006,"Tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) are regarded as successors of metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), but silicon-based TFETs typically suffer from low on-currents, a drawback related to the large resistance of the tunnel barrier. To achieve higher on-currents an elongate monocrystalline nanostructure-based TFET with a germanium (Ge) tunnel barrier in an otherwise silicon (Si) channel is used. An elongate monocrystalline nanostructure is introduced such that the lattice mismatch between silicon and germanium does not result in a highly defective interface. A dynamic power reduction as well as a static power reduction can result, compared to conventional MOSFET configurations. Multiple layers of logic can therefore be envisioned with these elongate monocrystalline nanostructure Si/Ge TFETs resulting in ultra-high on-chip transistor densities.","IMEC (INTERUNIVERSITY MICROELECTRONICS CENTRE)","H01L"

2007,"The invention relates to a method and a device for encoding the video level of a pixel of a picture into a subfield code word in a display device. It can be applied to every display device using a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) technology and subfields for displaying video picture. The bits of the subfield code word are computed recursively one after the other from the bit having the most significant weight to the bit having the least significant weight. According to the invention, for determining the state of a bit of the subfield code word, a first threshold and a second threshold is associated with said bit, said second threshold being greater than said first threshold, and the video level to be encoded by this bit and its following bits in the subfield code word are compared to the first and second thresholds. If the video level is lower than the first threshold, a state 'OFF' is allocated to the bit. If the video level is greater than the second threshold, a state 'ON' is allocated to the bit and if the video level is lying between the first and second thresholds, a state 'ON' is allocated to the bit according to a predetermined criteria.","THOMSON LICENSING","G09G"

The compositions are of improved lipophilic soil removing capability when diluted with water, are of about equivalent such capability in neat or concentrated form and are of significantly better hypochlorite stability on aging at room and elevated temperatures, compared to other microemulsion cleaners that contain hypochlorite. Their low viscosities facilitate spraying them from squeeze bottles or pump sprayers onto surfaces to be cleaned and disinfected or sanitized, such as floors and walls. The absence of any builder salts allows uses of the compositions, especially in diluted form, to clean surfaces without the need for rinsing (wiping sufficing), and the cleaned surfaces are not objectionably streaky afterward. The concentrated microemulsions are effective removers of mildew from bathroom tub and shower tiles, and other surfaces, but in such cases rinsing is usually desirable.

The present invention generates additional data for improving the filter efficiency based on undisturbed image data. This additional data for setting up an image filter is determined depending on the spatial position of the pixels within an image. An image is separated into a plurality of groups and separate filter data is determined for each group. The decoder analyses the filter information and determines an adaptive set of filter coefficients for each group of image elements separately. Based on a determined filter coefficient, an adaptive filtering of the decoded image data is performed depending on the spatial positions of the individual image elements. In this way, the decoder applies an improved filtering.","PANASONIC CORPORATION","H04N"

2006,"The used oil or liquid mixtures are subjected to a two-stage process. First, extraction (10) largely removes the impurities. Remaining impurities are then removed by absorption (11), the adsorbent being regenerable. The process is carried out in one, two or more stages. In the first stage, hydrocarbon is used as a non-polar extractant, or carbon dioxide is used as a polar extractant. In the second stage a polar adsorbent is used. This is thermally-regenerated. In the second stage, the adsorbent is distributed between one, two or more reaction vessels (23, 24). In alternating succession, one vessel is used for extraction and the other is used to regenerate adsorbent. The first stage extractant is propane, butane, n-pentane, non-polar C2 to C10 molecules, or their mixtures. Extraction takes place at ambient temperatures and pressures. A centrifuge or decanter is used, a mechanical vapor compressor being used for gas separation. In the second stage, regenerable ionic fluids remove remaining impurities. Extraction is used for regeneration. Following extraction, the extractant is separated from the fluid being treated, by ultrasonic vibrations and/or temperature increase and pressure reduction.

The invention enables the detection of small amounts of solid and liquid explosives (about 100g) in burned mines or elsewhere, containing only a very small ammount of metal (arround 0.5 g in a triggering mechanism). The detection of solid and liquid explosives according to this invention is achieved by the use of a magnet for initial polarization of hydrogen nuclei in a non-zero magnetic field B 0 ‰ 0, followed by the application of a fast NMR radio-frequency (RF) Carr-Purcell pulse sequence in the NMR channel I to see whether the proton NMR spin-spin relaxation time T 2 is short (microseconds) or long (milliseconds), when in the latter case it is highly probable that one deals with a liquid explosive, and with a solid explosive in the former case. The liquid explosive is further characterized in the NMR channel I, and the solid explosive in the NQR channel II. In the final step of identification of a tested explosive, the data of both channels are compared - by making use of a suitable electronic software - te with those of a data bank of all known explosives.","INSTITUT JOZEF STEFAN","G01N"

2005,"In a microphone apparatus adapted to an audio signal transmission/reception device including a speaker array for linearly arranging a plurality of speaker units and a microphone array for linearly arranging a plurality of microphone units, the plurality of microphone units are partially aligned with the equal spacing corresponding to a prescribed distance therebetween in a high-density alignment section that is set symmetrical to an alignment origin corresponding to a center point of linear alignment, and remaining ones within the plurality of microphone units are aligned in a low-density alignment section externally of the high-density alignment section in such a way that the spacing therebetween is sequentially broadened and is set integer times larger than the prescribed distance. Thus, it is possible to reduce the manufacturing cost by reducing the total number of the microphone units, and it is possible to improve sound reception directivity with respect to both of a high frequency band and a low frequency band.","YAMAHA CORPORATION","H04R"
2007,"A bass enhancing apparatus and method for enhancing bass include generating harmonics of the bass when an input signal is reproduced using a miniaturized speaker. The bass enhancing method includes extracting a bass component of an input signal, generating harmonics of the extracted bass component, synthesizing the generated harmonic signals and the input signal, and outputting the synthesizing result to an output terminal. The generating of the harmonics includes compressing a dynamic range of an amplitude level of each harmonic component at a predetermined distribution ratio.","SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS COMPANY","H04R"
