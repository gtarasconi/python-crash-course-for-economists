"EP",2,1991,"Methods are disclosed for the production of anti-self antibodies and antibody fragments, being antibodies or fragments of a particular species of mammal which bind self-antigens of that species. Methods comprise providing a library of replicable genetic display packages (rgdps), such as filamentous phage, each rgdp displaying at its surface a member of a specific binding pair which is an antibody or antibody fragment, and each rgdp containing nucleic acid sequence derived from a species of mammal. The nucleic acid sequence in each rgdp encodes a polypeptide chain which is a component part of the sbp member displayed at the surface of that rgdp. Anti-self antibody fragments are selected by binding with a self antigen from the said species of mammal. The displayed antibody fragments may be scFv, Fd, Fab or any other fragment which has the capability of binding antigen. Nucleic acid libraries used may be derived from a rearranged V-gene sequences of unimmunised mammal.

"EP",6,1999,"The system for automatically routing calls to call center agents in an agent surplus condition provides the call center administrator with an automatic agent assignment paradigm which functions to automatically increase the efficiency of assigning multiple skill agents to contacts. The presence of an agent surplus condition provides the present system with a plurality of choices in the assignment of the agent to process a presently received contact. Since the agents who staff the call center include multiple skill agents, the system must make a determination of not only which of the available agents is the best equipped to handle the present contact, but also how that assignment statistically effects the efficiency of successive assignments of agents to contacts next received, based upon the past performance of the agents and the call center. Since the traffic load presented to the call center tends to be highly variable and of content that is difficult to predict, the present system provides several automatic agent assignment paradigms that each have a statistically different impact on the performance of the call center, based upon the quality and quantity of the incoming calls. <IMAGE>","H04L","AVAYA TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION"

"EP",114,2005,"A method that seeks to provide a satisfactory quality of service for a stream of packets through a network. The illustrative embodiment of the present invention seeks to provide a satisfactory quality of service for a stream of packets by periodically or sporadically evaluating one or more alternative paths through the network and by sending the packets through a path with an acceptable quality of service. Normally, neither the source node nor any other node in a packet's path controls its route after it has left the node. In contrast, the illustrative embodiment of the present invention has the capability to affect the packet's path through the network by sending the packet to an intermediate or 'ricochet' node in the network, which forwards the packet to the destination node. In effect, the source node can, if it deems appropriate, ricochet the packet off of the intermediate node rather than allowing the packet to take its normal direct path through the network.","H04L","AVAYA TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION"

To achieve higher on-currents an elongate monocrystalline nanostructure-based TFET with a germanium (Ge) tunnel barrier in an otherwise silicon (Si) channel is used. An elongate monocrystalline nanostructure is introduced such that the lattice mismatch between silicon and germanium does not result in a highly defective interface.

"EP",24261,2000,"A multi-core DSP device (100) includes a shared program memory (10) to eliminate redundancy and thereby reduce the size and power consumption of the DSP device (100). Because each of the program cores (11, 21) typically executes the same software program, memory requirements may be reduced by having multiple processor cores (11, 21) share only a single copy of the software. Accordingly, a program memory (10) couples to each of the processor cores (11, 21) by a corresponding instruction bus (P1, P2). Preferably the program memory (10) services two or more instruction requests in each clock cycle. Data is preferably stored in separate memory arrays (12, 13, 22, 23) local to the processor core subsystems (101, 102) and accessible by the processor cores (11, 21) via a dedicated data bus (D1, D2). In one specific implementation, the program memory (10) includes a wrapper that can perform one memory access in the first half of each clock cycle and a second memory access in the second half of each clock cycle. A designated set of instruction buses (P1) is allowed to arbitrate for only the first access, and the remaining instruction buses (P2) are allowed to arbitrate for only the second access. In this manner, a reduction in on-board memory requirements and associated power consumption may be advantageously reduced. <IMAGE>","G06F","TEXAS INSTRUMENTS"

Servers may include service agents, both human and robotic. A server assignor and a corresponding server assignment method may each be employed in a work distributor or an automatic call distributor ('ACD') to conditionally adjust server availability in server pools. The server assignor compares a composite preference value for a work type against each server's threshold value for the work type.

"EP",43592,2007,"In mobile data network scenarios are possible where different mobility management schemes, such as host-based and network-based, are applied to the same mobile node. In case of host-based mobility, the mobile node (MN) sends message (called binding updates) for registration of a new location to the mobility anchor. In case of network-based mobility, the registration message is sent by a proxy mobility agent (PMA) on behalf of the MN. Since the registration messages are sent by different entities, they may suffer by various delay conditions and may arrive re-ordered at the mobility anchor node (called home agent, HA). This is called race condition between registration messages. If the both entities, MN and PMA, sending registration message are not synchronized or use different criteria for comparison of the messages' freshness, the HA cannot decide which message has been sent most currently. To avoid this problem, a new mechanism in the mobility anchor node is introduced. This mechanism first detects whether race condition between registration messages occur and second resolves the most recent location of the mobile node, as both sending sources of registration messages are polled by using standard Mobile IP procedures.","H04L","PANASONIC CORPORATION"

A second problem is that, upon high-efficient image encoding, the detection process of the global motion vector is performed even when it is not necessary to detect the global motion vector. An image encoding apparatus is equipped with a mechanism for detecting a global motion vector. The mechanism is located outside an image converter that utilizes spatial correlations, such as high-frequency component removal by a DCT and round-down by a quantization, and variable encoding.","H04N","SHARP CORPORATION"

"EP",56868,2007,"Techniques are disclosed for sharing programmatic modules among isolated virtual machines. A master JVM process loads data from a programmatic module, storing certain elements of that data into its private memory region, and storing other elements of that data into a 'read-only' area of a shareable memory region. The master JVM process copies loaded data from its private memory region into a 'read/write' area of the shareable memory region. Instead of re-loading the data from the programmatic module, other JVM processes map to the read-only area and also copy the loaded data from the read/write area into their own private memory regions. The private memory areas of all of the JVM processes begin at the same virtual memory address, so references between read-only data and copied data are preserved correctly. As a result, multiple JVM processes start up faster, and memory is conserved by avoiding the redundant storage of shareable data.","G06F","SUN MICROSYSTEMS"

"EP",67220,1992,"Improved circuits for measuring the conductivity of a solution confined between two electrodes in a cell compensate for series capacitance and parallel capacitance between the electrodes. A bipolar square-wave signal is applied to the cell. In one embodiment, the current through the cell is measured by an op-amp in current-to-voltage converter configuration. A feedback resistance employed with the op-amp in a feedback loop is controlled to a low value to ensure that the parallel capacitance is fully charged during an initial portion of each half-cycle of the drive signal. The feedback resistance is then selected so that the gain of the feedback loop is responsive to the range of the resistivity of the solution, and the measurement is made. The period of the bipolar signal is selected responsive to the selected loop gain, to ensure that a filter capacitor across the op-amp is fully charged, and to limit distortion caused by the series capacitance. More particularly, the rate of charge of the series capacitance is proportional to the solution resistance; by varying the period of the drive signal in accordance with the solution resistance, the distortion introduced by the series capacitance remains negligible. In a further embodiment, charge proportional to the current through the cell is integrated across the op-amp, and the rate of charge is measured by measuring the time required to integrate the current to a predetermined level, and used to determine the resistivity of the solution. In this embodiment, the parallel capacitance is fully charged before each integration period begins.

More specifically, with this invention, preprocessed video and multimedia data packets are striped across disks in units of fixed playback time, even if such units result in variable length stripes. To deliver multiple video or continuous media streams, the disks in the array are accessed simultaneously so that at any given instance, different disks are accessing the video or multimedia data for different streams. Access to the disks for reading the continuous media files is scheduled periodically, with the period equal to the back time of the stripes. Because each disk read command retrieves data for a fixed play back time, if the first read command for a continuous media stream request can be scheduled to complete on a disk within a playback time, all subsequent read commands are also guaranteed to not interfere with read commands of other streams. Data is delivered directly from the disk array to the communication network by a stream controller without being sent to the host system. Disk storage is utilized efficiently by allocating disk space in units of cylinders and storing the variable size stripes of video in packed format. <IMAGE>","G06F","IBM (INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION)"

Each WNM in the set is characterized by an ordinal WNM number and a WNM size (maximum number of tokens) that is in general a non-decreasing function of the WNM number. A given token is assigned (52) a number pair, the first being one of the WNM numbers, and the second being the token's position or number in that WNM.

"EP",92881,1994,"Bytes of different types of digital information, including standard interframe video (SIF), graphics, television and audio are transferred between a controller, storage memory and shift registers (e.g. FIFO's) individually associated with the different information types. For a VRAM memory, information is transferred in parallel, controlled by tag bus information, from the controller to the memory and then serially to the FIFO's, all at a frequency higher than a clock frequency in a monitor raster scan. The tag bus information is decoded and introduced to an additional FIFO. A state machine processes such additional FIFO information and transfers the digital information to the different FIFO's at times controlled in each line by such additional FIFO- e.g. particular times in each line for the SIF and graphics and thereafter, for television and audio, at times unrelated to any times in such line. The graphics transfer is timed to substantially fill, but not overflow, in such line the limited capacity of the associated FIFO. Their limited capacities cause the television and audio FIFO's to stop receiving bytes when filled to particular limits.

Within the device tree (10) are device nodes which specify a particular device's name and a property which indicates compatible device names to the device. For a particular device, the system constructs a candidate list of drivers by comparing the device name and the compatible names from the device tree (10) against all the driver names of data fields of all known drivers. The candidate list is sorted so that matches by device name and proper version number are higher priority. The system then sequentially attempts installation of the drivers from the candidate list based on priority to determine the appropriate driver. Drivers that cause an error are skipped, as are those that do not properly configure the device. The process is operable on boot up and upon any system change that allows more drivers to be recognized.","G06F","APPLE"

The method for producing a back contact (21) of a silicon-based solar cell (20), comprises applying a metallic layer (24) of the back contact on a back side of a substrate (22) in an inline-vacuum coating plant by sputtering a target or by evaporating, and applying further layers of the solar cell on a front side and/or the back side of the substrate in the inline-vacuum coating plant before or after applying the metallic layer without interruption of the vacuum. The layers are applied by coating tools. A passive layer (23) is applied before applying the metallic layer and a barrier layer is applied after applying the metallic layer. The coating tools for applying the layers on the back side of the substrate are oppositely arranged to the coating tools for applying the layers on the front side of the substrate in relation to the alignment of the vacuum coating plant. The substrate lies on a punctiform support of a carrier to avoid a shadowing of the substrate by the carrier. The substrate is moved past at the coating tools in a horizontal alignment, so that the coating direction vertically runs. The metallic layer is separated with a thickness of 2 mu m. After applying the metallic layer, the metallic layer is partially melted with the substrate by an intensive laser beam for contacting the metallic layer on the back side of the substrate, so that a laser-fired contact (LFC) forms itself. A solderable layer (25) is applied after applying the metallic layer and/or the barrier layer. Two layers are applied in a vacuum treatment chamber. The layer is applied on the front side during applying the layer on the back side. Several substrates are arranged in a common carrier and simultaneously provided with the layers. Two coating tools in the vacuum treatment chamber are provided in a common plug-in unit in drawer-like manner. A first coating tool points on the front side and a second coating tool points on the back side. One of the layers of metallic layer, barrier layer and solderable layer is evaporated.
