<p>Inter-firm relationships are coordinated to a large extent by non-market mechanisms. The objective of this paper is to identify which of these mechanisms are the most relevant, and how they can be theoretically and empirically combined into discrete alternative modes of organizational coordination between firms. A framework is developed for evaluating the comparative effectiveness and efficiency of these combinations of coordination mechanisms in the regulation of different types of inter-firm interdependence, drawing on both organization theory and organization economics. By analyzing network forms as mixes of coordination mechanisms, the framework offers a typology of inter-firm organization forms that is much more fine-grained and conducive to network organization design than those previously available. The predictive power of the framework is demonstrated by using the vast empirical research available on various types of networks, showing its capacity to explain the main findings on the use of different network forms for governing different types of relations.</p>"

<p>We consider an overlapping generations model where heterogeneous agents take decisions on consumption and investment in education under the assumption of imperfect capital markets.

The standard neutrality result for fully funded pension schemes does not hold in this framework. We establish the conditions under which a fully funded scheme is associated with a higher investment in human capital. We show that the transition path may involve poverty traps.</p>"

<p>This paper presents a model in which agents choose to use money as a medium of exchange, a means of payment, and a unit of account. The paper defines conditions under which nominal contracts, promising future payment of a fixed number of units of fiat money, prove to be the optimal contract form in the presence of either relative or aggregate price risk. When relative prices are random, nominal contracts are optimal if individuals have ex ante similar preferences over future consumption. When the aggregate price level is random, whether from shocks to the money supply or aggregate output, nominal contracts (perhaps coupled with equity contracts) lead to optimal risk-sharing if individuals have the same degree of relative risk aversion. Finally, nominal contracts may be optimal if the repayment of contracts is subject to a binding cash-in-advance constraint. In this case, a contingent contract increases the risk of holding excessive cash balances.</p>"

<p>Whether in high-tech, service, or traditional industries, the role of knowledge as a primary driver of development is being increasingly recognized. It is not clear, however, whether managerial approaches based on mindsets rooted in past practice are appropriate for, or capable of, fully realizing the potential value of knowledge within the firm and/or industry. At least three related issues stand in the way of full knowledge utilization: conceptualization and measurement of knowledge capital as a primary organizational asset, the integration of knowledge capital into the strategic management process, and the development of organizational forms and processes that facilitate the use and development of knowledge. While leading-edge firms are already wrestling with these issues, advances in theory and research are needed to help develop appropriate responses and provide frameworks that will help spread these new approaches. In doing so, advances may also be made that allow for the recognition of the central role of collaboration in the knowledge process.</p>"

<p>This paper evaluates VAR models designed to analyse the monetary policy transmission mechanism in the United States by considering three issues: specification, identification, and the effect of the omission of the long-term interest rate. Specification analysis suggests that only VAR models estimated on a single monetary regime feature parameters stability and do not show signs of mis-specification. The identification analysis shows that VAR-based monetary policy shocks and policy disturbances identified from alternative sources are not highly correlated but yield similar descriptions of the monetary transmission mechanism. Lastly, the inclusion of the long-term interest rate in a benchmark VAR delivers a more precise estimation of the structural parameters capturing behaviour in the market for reserves and shows that contemporaneous fluctuations in long-term interest rates are an important determinant of the monetary authority's reaction function.

The tradeoff facing the region whose central bank controls the exchange rate in a managed exchange rate regime does not change moving to a symmetric flexible exchange rate regime. Instead, the core region in an asymmetric regime faces a worse tradeoff than under flexible exchange rates.

<p>This paper uses data on new subsidiaries, acquisitions, collaborative agreements, and patents of the largest 32 US and European electronics firms during 1984-1992 to examine the relationships between technological and business diversification. We find that during the 1980s many firms focused on fewer businesses, but we find no evidence of greater technological focus. We argue that this is related to the fact that, in spite of technological convergence, electronics sectors still command highly industry- or even product-specific downstream assets. In addition, we find that business focus improved performance, but that better performance is also associated with greater technological diversification. We discuss some interpretation of this finding. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>It is known that deviating from the one-share-one-vote principle through the issue of non-voting stock increases the value of outsiders' voting rights. We argue that the creation of a business group is another way to deviate from one-share-one-vote and we show that it produces a larger voting-share premium in holding companies. As a consequence, having both subsidiaries and non-voting stock produces a multiplier effect on the voting premium. The puzzling size of the premium in Italy was never related to the interaction of pyramiding and non-voting stock. Our empirical study confirms that the premium is larger for holding companies issuing non-voting stock than for similar operating companies without non-voting equity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

<p>Contingent and institutional perspectives have been contrasted in order to explain the evolution of organization structures and inter-firm relations in the Italian and German machine-building industries, both of which were racked by a massive change in their competitive and technological environments. The result was an increasing similarity in their internal and external organization. The change was guided by an interplay of autonomous problem solving, mimetic isomorphism of fashionable practices and societal features. The different education and industrial relations systems appeared to be functionally equivalent. The task characteristics (type of strategy, the variability of customer demands, and technological complexity) were related to configurational and functional differentiation, the rigidity of functional specialization and the intensity of interfunctional coordination; the exceptionality of customer demands was related to features of the internal processes. Task characteristics were also related to the level of outsourcing and the mode of inter-firm coordination; the measurability of a supplier's performance was related to inter-firm coordination mechanisms. The characteristics of both internal and external organization affected each other.</p>"

<p>The failure of SPRINTEL, an interorganizational information system in Prato (Italy), raises a number of interesting questions with regard to the technical-economic and socio-political perspectives that currently dominate the information systems/information technology literature. These questions underscore the importance of developing additional theoretical perspectives in order to better understand the role of information systems in organizations. This article reflects upon these questions and their theoretical foundations in the context of a case study. The case study describes the implementation, usage, and outcome of an interorganizational information system. An analysis is made of the extent to which the technical-economic and socio-political perspectives are sufficient to explain the failure of this system. The outcome of the analysis shows that these two perspectives are insufficient to provide an explanation. Based on the literature from a variety of sources, a third, complementary perspective is developed. Like the socio-political perspective (Kling 1980), this perspective is also an interactionist perspective. However, instead of focusing on politics and conflict as the primary interaction mode, it focuses on collaboration and cooperation as the key to understanding interaction processes. This perspective introduces a third rationality of information systems in which trust, social capital, and collaborative relationships become the key concepts for interpretation.</p>"

This is because: (i) employment security regulations can only be enforced by increasing the number of workers on 'short-term jobs', and (ii) the latter compete for jobs with unemployed jobseekers. Evidence is presented showing that job-finding probabilities of the unemployed are decreasing in the incidence of temporary employment, in line with the predictions of the model.

<p>Pressed by an impressive series of corruption scandals and by a change of attitude towards cost-containment, the Italian pharmaceutical sector's regulatory environment was radically changed in 1994. Regulatory power was concentrated on a national technical body (CUF) and a new set of measures was taken, including a nationwide drug expenditure budget, a redefinition of both the positive list and the cost-sharing rules, and new price-setting models. As a result, in the period 1993-1996, nominal expenditures decreased by about L 1600 billion (ECU 83.6 billion at 1997 exchange rate), that is from 13.3% to 11.0% of current National Health Service (NHS) expenditure. While in the 1980s Italy was one of the most generous countries in funding pharmaceuticals, it is now one of the most parsimonious. Although the overall pharmaceutical market shrank in 1994 and 1995, a substantial part of NHS drug-bill savings resulted from cost-shifting from the public sector to patients, mainly because physicians have not aligned their prescribing behaviour to the new positive list. The new Italian approach to containing pharmaceutical costs has been certainly effective, at least in the short run. However, new relevant issues are emerging regarding the fall of NHS pharmaceutical coverage, the centralised nature of the Italian pharmaceutical policy and the gap between scientific based policies and actual prescribing behaviours.

Using data from the Polish tabor Force Survey, we develop and estimate an econometric model that enables us to isolate the effects of dismissal and job offer arrival rates and wage offer distributions on observed transition probabilities and wage payments. Our findings suggest that low mobility can be explained by the relatively insignificant monetary returns to job changes as well as by market segmentation in the allocation of job offers.

Clinical outcome was assessed by means of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scales. Cost analysis followed a two-step procedure: (i) to record all health care services provided to patients and (ii) to assign a monetary value to each service. Three of the 15 patients enrolled in the study dropped out before the end of the 12-month period of therapy. Considering the 12 patients on clozapine treatment for at least 1 year, clinical improvements are associated with a substantial modification of the pattern of care. While patients in the pre-clozapine period were mainly managed in hospital settings, patients on clozapine were prevalently placed in the community and participated in intensive rehabilitative programmes. The higher costs of drug therapy and community services in the post-clozapine period were more than offset by the lower costs of acute hospital care.</p>"

The process of building a World Service model is described, both in terms of historical and technical stages.

Equilibrium (Rubinstein-Wolinsky 1994) when the game and the players' Bayesian rationality are common knowledge. In this paper I argue for a refinement of Rationalizable Conjectural Equilibrium showing by propositions and by examples how this equilibrium notion works and how the suitable equilibrium concept depends on the players' information.

<p>We try to demonstrate how economists may engage in research on comparative politics, relating the size and composition of government spending to the political system. A Downsian model of electoral competition and forward-looking voting indicates that majoritarian - as opposed to proportional - elections increase competition between parties by focusing it into some key marginal districts. This leads to less public goods, less rents for politicians, more redistribution and larger government. A model of legislative bargaining and backward-looking voting indicates that presidential - as opposed to parliamentary - regimes increase competition between both politicians and voters. This leads to less public goods, less rents for politicians, less redistribution, and smaller government. We confront these predictions with cross-country data from around 1990, controlling for economic and social determinants of government spending. We find strong and robust support for the prediction that the size of government is smaller under presidential regimes, and weaker support for the prediction that majoritarian elections are associated with less public goods.

<p>Several recent studies based on 'exogenous' sources of variation in educational outcomes show IV estimates of returns to schooling that are substantially higher than the corresponding OLS estimates. Card (1995a, Earnings, schooling, and ability revisited. Research in Labor Economics 14, 23-48) suggests that these results are explained by the existence of heterogenity in individual returns and by the fact that these studies are based on instruments that influence only the educational decision of individuals with high marginal returns due to either liquidity constraints or to high ability. This conclusion is consistent with the local average treatment effect (LATE) interpretation of IV (Imbens and Angrist, 1994, Identification and estimation of local average treatment effects. Econometrica 62, 467-475) according to which IV identifies only the average returns of those who comply with the assignment-to-treatment mechanism implied by the instrument. We show evidence for Germany suggesting that returns to schooling are heterogeneous, instruments matter and the LATE interpretation of IV makes sense. With an appropriate choice of instruments we also show how IV can be used to approximate the range of variations of returns to schooling in Germany. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

<p>The past decade has witnessed the explosive growth of a multiplicity of new instruments which have altered the financial landscape. These transactions have highlighted many of the inconsistencies, asymmetries and shortcomings of current tax practices and challenged some basic tax principles. The ensuing uncertainties could over the long term place considerable strain on the tax system by increasing the opportunities for abuse and raising overall compliance costs. At the same time derivatives have provided a better understanding of the operation tax laws and from this standpoint have provided a positive input into policy design. This paper has three objectives: (a) to illustrate some of the weaknesses of the current tax system by focusing on several types of novel transaction; (b) to assess the validity of various types of adjustment proposed to tax code; (c) to draw out the implications of these developments for the ongoing debate over fundamental tax reforms and over source versus residence based taxes.</p>"

<p>This paper provides new empirical evidence on the patterns of technological entry and exit across sectors and over time. We define 'new' innovators-firms which innovate for the first time, and 'ex'-innovators-previous innovators that do not innovate any more. We distinguish also between 'real' and 'lateral' entry and exit. The analysis is based on patent data (European Patent Office) for 49 technological classes in six countries (USA, Japan, Germany, UK, France and Italy) over the period 1978-1991. We find that innovative turbulence is relevant and that it is a composite phenomenon, in which real innovative entrants/exiters and lateral entrants/exiters play different roles. We then examine the patterns of survival of innovative entrants and find that most of the entrants are occasional innovators, while persistent innovators are few in number but large in terms of patents. Subsequently, we analyze differences in the patterns of technological entry and exit at the sectoral level. Finally, the role of national systems of innovation in affecting innovative entry and exit is examined. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>The empirical evidence that evaluates ex-post the effects of trade policy confirms the presumption, well known in theory, that quantitative barriers to trade have an impact on the average quality of exports. Yet, in evaluating ex-ante the effects of trade policy reform, very few studies take into account the role of the induced change in quality. The paper evaluates the effects of liberalization in the Italian car market through a calibrated model where the choice of the quality of exports is made endogenous. Simulating the removal of the VER on Japanese exports, there are substantial gains from liberalization when only quantity effects are considered. Results change dramatically if quality effects are taken into account: the downgrading in Japanese exports entails a strong reduction in consumers' gains.</p>"

When defining a measure of risk-adjusted performance, there is no multipurpose solution: the measure must be chosen based on the characteristics of each business unit and the degree of centralization or decentralization of the allocation process. Greater attention to capital allocation is therefore required so that more sophisticated risk measures can produce the desired results.</p>"

<p>This paper investigates the structure of a National Health Service in which there is compulsory social insurance covering a package of essentials, a given part of individuals' health expenditure, and supplementary private policy topping up the remaining services. The latter insurance contract provides for a co-payment by patients, limiting the so-called ""third-party payer"" effect. Thus, an individual's health expenditure is divided into three parts: the first covered by social insurance, the second by a private policy and the third out-of-pocket. Such mixed system design has received increasing attention in recent years and has been adopted by several industrialized countries. The conditions for optimal rates of social insurance coverage and of private coinsurance are analysed and discussed. The optimality requirements refer to efficiency as well as equity concerns.

For illustration, the methodology is applied to assess the quality of the US M1 data production process and to derive a conditional model whose performance in forecasting is then tested against other alternatives based on simple transformations of provisional data or of past final data.

<p>The reduction in National Health Service (NHS) expenditure as a share of total health care expenditure, the fragmentation of the NHS into 21 regional systems and the implementation of a 'quasi-market' on the provider side of the system has pressed the government to define and specify, in detail, the set of services that are to be guaranteed by the public sector. To understand whether rationing can be more rational and explicit in the Italian NHS, the following are analysed: (i) the new positive list of drugs, as a major example of limiting and making more rational NHS pharmaceutical coverage; (ii) the Di Bella case, as an example of the difficulties of rational policy-makings on sensitive issues; (iii) what Italian people think about health care rationing and priority setting (using the 1998 Eurobarometer Survey);( iv) the criteria defining the set of 'essential services' to be guaranteed to all Italian citizens, which are contained in the recently released National Health Plan. The 'revolution' that has taken place in the pharmaceutical sector shows it is feasible to limit, in an explicit and rational way, the extent of NHS coverage. However, the re-classification of the positive list should be regarded as an exceptional event in the history of Italian social policy. The 'Di Bella' case, on the contrary, shows that limiting NHS coverage can be very unpopular, and that the Italian cultural and social context can be unfavourable for the implementation of hard choices. Public attitude toward rationing seems to confirm that Italians are not familiar with rationing issues. Thus, it is very difficult to predict whether the national government will really go ahead with the implementation of a 'list of essential services' and whether this attempt will be successful. Rationing and priority setting should be discussed in the context of a general debate concerning the future of the Italian NHS. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Background: The present work is a cost-of-illness (COI) study that aims at assessing total direct and indirect costs of schizophrenic patients in community psychiatric services in Italy and identifying the variables that influence costs. Methods: A retrospective prevalence-based multi-centre COI study, was designed. Ten Community mental health centres (CMHC) were involved and 100 patients were recruited. Data on patients' costs were gathered through specifically designed instruments. Results: More than half total direct costs was attributed to CMHC interventions. The yearly average costs of schizophrenia per patient amounted to nearly ITL 50 million: 30% for direct costs and 70% for indirect costs. Conclusion: CMHCs tend to manage long-term ill patients by adopting a strong community-based system of cart. Schizophrenia is correlated to loss of working days and lack of well-being. From the results of this study. ii might be argued that the de-institutionalisation programme has produced 'spillovers' in terms of families greater involvement in patients management.

<p>Objective: To describe the pharmacological treatment for major depression under the conditions of routine Italian public mental health facilities, assess its costs, and study its main predictors according to a societal perspective.</p>
<p>Design: This was a prospective multicentre observational study designed to evaluate the economics of treatment of major depression using a specifically designed 65-item questionnaire. Data on drug consumption were collected in a section of the questionnaire and are presented here.</p>
<p>Patients and participants: 60 mental health facilities were selected and 556 patients were enrolled and followed up for 15 months.</p>
<p>Results: Pharmacological treatment appears to be the most common treatment for major depression. 98% of patients were prescribed an antidepressant. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were the most prescribed antidepressants. Patients treated with SSRIs suffered from less severe depression than those treated with tricyclic antidepressants. Benzodiazepines were prescribed for 84% of patients enrolled. The total drug cost was 1 120 000 Italian lire ($US707) per patient (1995 values). Less than 20% of this cost was borne by the Italian National Health Service, as the majority of drugs used were not reimbursed.</p>
<p>Conclusions: The costs of the most widespread approach to treating major depression (pharmacological treatment) are not currently covered by the Italian National Health Service. Prescribing of drugs seems to diverge from the standards of treatment indicated by the Italian Drug Committee.</p>"

<p>This study sets out to test the assumption that concepts of leadership differ as a function of cultural differences in Europe and to identify dimensions which describe differences in leadership concepts across European countries. Middle-level managers (N = 6052) from 22 European countries rated 112 questionnaire items containing descriptions of leadership traits and behaviours. For each attribute respondents rated how well it fits their concept of an outstanding business leader. The findings support the assumption that leadership concepts are culturally endorsed. Specifically, clusters of European countries which share similar cultural values according to prior cross-cultural research (Ronen & Shenkar, 1985), also share similar leadership concepts. The leadership prototypicality dimensions found are highly correlated with cultural dimensions reported in a comprehensive cross-cultural study of contemporary Europe (Smith, Dugan, & Trompenaars, 1996). The ordering of countries on the leadership dimensions is considered a useful tool with which to model differences between leadership concepts of different cultural origin in Europe. Practical implications for cross-cultural management, both in European and non-European settings, are discussed.</p>"

<p>In this paper we develop a model of a vertically differentiated industry where the production of higher quality goods needs a higher fraction of specialized labour. In the first stage, firms choose the quality of their products, in the second, both good prices and skilled workers' wages are determined. We show that in duopoly, though supplying different variants of the product, firms tend to cluster either at the bottom or at the top of the quality ladder, depending on skilled labour availability. This switch in equilibrium qualities creates a discontinuous behaviour for the wage rate of skilled workers. When the supply of skilled labour is made endogenous, two equilibria are simultaneously possible: one with low-skill, low-quality, the other with high-skill, high-quality.

<p>To the layman, the upward trend in European unemployment is related to the slowdown of economic growth. We argue that the layman's view is correct. The increase in European unemployment and the slowdown in economic growth are related, because they stem from a common cause: an excessively rapid growth in the cost of labour. In Europe, labour costs have gone up for many reasons, but one is particularly easy to identify: higher taxes on labour. If wages are set by strong and decentralized trade unions, an increase in labour taxes is shifted onto higher real wages. This has two effects. First, it reduces labour demand, and thus creates unemployment. Secondly, as firms substitute capital for labour, the marginal product of capital falls; over long periods of time, this in turn diminishes the incentive to invest and to grow. The data strongly support this view. According to our estimates, the observed rise of 14 percentage points in labour tax rates between 1965 and 1995 in the EU could account for a rise in EU unemployment of roughly 4 percentage points, a reduction of the investment share of output of about about 3 percentage points, and a growth slowdown of about 0.4 percentage points a year.</p>"

<p>Several recent studies suggest that the response of national saving to fiscal policy may be non-linear. In this paper we use two data sets to search for the circumstances in which such non-linear response may arise: a sample of OECD countries, already used in previous studies, and a sample of developing countries, using more recent World Bank data. We find that in both samples non-linear effects tend to be associated with large and persistent fiscal impulses. In the OECD sample the non-linearity of the response is stronger for fiscal contractions than for expansions. An increase in net taxes has no effect on national saving during large fiscal contractions, while it has a positive effect in less pronounced contractions. High or rapidly growing public debt does not appear to be a good predictor of non-linear effects. In the World Bank sample of developing countries, non-linearities in the response national saving to fiscal policy are not limited to large fiscal contractions, and also tend to occur in periods in which debt is accumulating rapidly, regardless of its initial level.

<p>Aim The EARISA Registry was designed to describe diagnostic and therapeutic resources used in Italian cardiology centers for patients with the epidemiologically most relevant cardiac diseases. This article focuses on patients with unstable angina; characteristics associated with invasive procedures were specifically analyzed.</p>
<p>Methods and Results Information was collected over a 2-week period on 1420 patients with unstable angina discharged from 308 cardiology centers. The mean length of stay was 9 +/- 6 days; 51% of patients were admitted to a coronary care unit (mean length of stay, 4 +/- 3 days). Noninvasive procedures included echocardiography (64%), Hotter monitoring (25%), exercise stress testing (24%), and echocardiographic stress testing or nuclear imaging (7%). Invasive procedures were coronary angiography (39%) and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting (13%). Unstable angina had a greater impact on invasive procedures than acute myocardial infarction. Variables independently associated with a higher rate of coronary angiographic procedures were younger age, higher technologic level of the hospital, and need for intravenous therapy;</p>
<p>Conclusion In Italy, approximately half the patients with unstable angina are admitted to hospitals without catheterization laboratories or cardiac surgery facilities. This fact supports the concept that treatments that can be administered in all types of hospitals are more likely to affect the outcome of patients with unstable angina. Overall, the rates of coronary angiography and revascularization procedures appeared tow, and the setting where cardiologists practice, rather than patient characteristics, is the major determinant of the care given to patients with unstable angina.</p>"

<p>It is suggested that a transition is taking place towards new modes of organising transnational corporations' innovative activities. First, different: units of multinational firms, including foreign-based subsidiaries, are increasingly involved in the generation, use and transmission of knowledge. Secondly, multinationals are developing external networks of relationships with local counterparts, through which foreign affiliates gain access to external knowledge sources and application abilities. As a result of this evolutionary process, multinationals' organisation is subject to both centripetal and centrifugal forces. Considerable efforts are then necessary to innovate coordination procedures and mechanisms, in order to enhance the generation, circulation and use of knowledge. A number of empirical works are reviewed, providing some evidence of the evolutionary process discussed in the paper.</p>"

<p>This paper develops a particular technique for extracting market expectations from asset prices. We use the term structure of interest rates to estimate the probability the market attaches to the event that a country, Italy, joins the European Monetary Union at a given date. The case of Italy is interesting because in the survey regularly conducted by Reuters, the probability that Italy joins EMU in 1999 has fluctuated, in the first months of 1997, between 0.07 and 0.15, while, during the same period, the measures computed by financial houses - which art: based on the term structure of interest rates - ranged between 0.5 and 0.8. The paper proposes a new method for computing these probabilities. and shows that the discrepancies between survey and market-based measures are not the result of market inefficiencies, but depend on an incorrect use of the term structure to compute probabilities. The technique proposed in the paper can also be used to distinguish between convergence of probabilities and convergence of fundamentals, that is to find out whether an observed reduction in interest rate spreads signals a higher probability of joining EMU at a given date, or simply reflects improved fundamentals. It could also be applied, more generally, to extract from assets prices, information on imminent changes in an exchange rate regime. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

<p>A wave of reforms was introduced in Italy during the 1990s in the field of pensions and in the labour market. In many respects, these reforms have substantially redesigned the overall profile of the Italian welfare state as it had developed under the so-called First Republic (1948-92). Pension expenditure has been brought under control and the pension formula has been substantially rationalised. A clear shift from passive to active policies is visible in the labour market, which is also beginning to become more flexible. The reforms of the 1990s have been introduced via an increasingly well-articulated system of 'concertation' between the government and the social partners. The negotiated character of the reforms is largely responsible for their success. The politico-institutional transition of the domestic political system and the dynamics of European integration both explain in turn the emergence of this new style of policy making.</p>"

<p>The conciliation of economic growth and social justice has been one of the most significant achievements of twentieth-century welfare states. Yet today it is the object of heated controversy. The 'conciliatory' capacity of the welfare state has been put in serious question, especially in the light of 'globalisation'. In this conclusion we consider first the relative influence of external versus domestic developments in generating welfare policy dilemmas and apparently unavoidable trade-offs between efficiency and equality, growth and redistribution, competitiveness and solidarity. Via an examination of employment, social security and health policy we then seek to identify the scope for new value combinations and institutional arrangements that are both mixed (in respect of their normative aims) and virtuous (able to produce advances on ail fronts). We conclude by considering how this agenda can be advanced in political and institutional terms.</p>"

The analysis is based on a dataset created specifically for this purpose. It concentrates on the manufacturing sectors, classified according to the Pavitt taxonomy. Firstly, data summarizing the recent trend of FDI in the CEECs is presented and then empirical evidence given to account for differences between sectors. The estimated model is a generalization of a three-way fixed effect model incorporating 'classic' variables, such as labour costs as well as country-specific variables, i.e., the stage reached in the transition process. The results confirm the presence of heterogeneity at sector level. JEL classification: F15, F23, P20, C23.</p>"

<p>We propose a model with micropolitical foundations to contrast different political regimes. Compared to a parliamentary regime, the institutions of a presidential-congressional regime produce fewer incentives for legislative cohesion but more separation of powers. These differences are reflected in the size and composition of government spending. A parliamentary regime has redistribution toward a majority, less underprovision of public goods, and more rents to politicians; a presidential-congressional regime has redistribution toward powerful minorities, more underprovision of public goods, but less rents to politicians. The size of government is smaller under a presidential regime. This last prediction is consistent with cross-country data.</p>"

<p>The Magenta Community Mental Health Centre (CMHC) is the public agency responsible for providing adult psychiatric care to about 85,000 adult residents.

These values mask large variation across diagnosis: while patients with schizophrenia and related disorders had an average cost of Euro 3,771, those with neurotic and related disorders had an average cost of Euro 439. Patients with schizophrenia and related disorders (28% of the patients) absorbed about 60% of total costs and made extensive use of several types of services (hospital, outpatient, domiciliary, social and rehabilitative care).

<p>In this paper, we explore some problems that industrial policy faces in industries characterized by dynamic increasing returns on the basis of a 'history friendly model' of the evolution of the computer industry. How does policy affect industry structure over the course of industry evolution? Is the timing of the intervention important? Do policy interventions have indirect and perhaps unintended consequences on different markets at different times? We focus on two sets of policies: antitrust and interventions aiming at supporting the entry of new forms in the industry. The results of our simulations show that, if strong dynamic increasing returns are operative, both through technological capabilities and through customer tendency to stick with a brand, there is little that antitrust and entry policy could have done to avert the rise of a dominant firm in mainframes. On the other hand, if the customer lock in effect had been smaller, either by chance or through policies that discouraged efforts of firms to lock in their customers, the situation might have been somewhat different. In the first place, even in the absence of antitrust or entry encouraging policies, market concentration would have been lower, albeit a dominant firm would emerge anyhow. Second, antitrust and entry encouraging policies would have been more effective in assuring that concentration would decrease. The leading firm would continue to dominate the market, but its relative power would be reduced. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. JEL classification: L10; IA; O30; L63.</p>"

<p>The fundamental problems facing European welfare states - high employment and unsustainable public pensions plans in particular - have been in the political debate for years, so why have we seen so little reform? To find out, we surveyed the opinions of citizens in France, Germany, Italy and Spain on their welfare states and on various reform options. This is what we found. First, most workers underestimate the costs of public pensions, though they are aware of their unsustainability. Second, the status quo is a majoritarian outcome: a majority of citizens opposes cuts to social security and welfare spending, but also opposes further increases. Since population ageing without reform implies an automatic expansion, our results suggest that most citizens would favour reforms that stabilize but do not shrink the current welfare states. Third, many would welcome changes in the allocation of benefits. A large number of workers in Italy and Germany would be willing opt out of public pensions and replace them with private pensions, though the details of how this scheme is formulated matter for its popularity. And many Italians and Spaniards would welcome an extension of the coverage of unemployment insurance. Fourth, conflicts over the welfare state are mainly shaped by the economic situation of the respondent, while political ideology plays a limited role. Disagreements are found along three dimensions: young versus old, rich versus poor, and 'outsider' versus 'insider' in terms of labour market status. From a practical point of view, this suggests that there is scope to bundle reforms strategically in order to build a large and mixed coalition of supporters.</p>"

<p>This note shows that residence- and source-based taxes on capital income are not sufficient to sustain an efficient Nash equilibrium when several goods are internationally traded, apart from two special cases. With several traded commodities, domestic fiscal policies affect foreign welfare not only through changes in the world interest rate but also through changes in the equilibrium relative prices of traded commodities. In order to guarantee the existence of an efficient Nash equilibrium in the general case, additional tax instruments are required. In particular, destination-based taxes on traded commodities are needed to enable the government to control the relative commodity prices faced by domestic consumers. In addition, in order to shield domestic producers from changes in world prices, the government must levy either origin-based commodity taxes or taxes on the immobile factors.</p>"

<p>We use a spatial model of endogenous growth to investigate the likely impact of discriminatory integration between two advanced insider countries on their own welfare as well as on the welfare of an outsider transition economy. A first point is that, since convergence in per capita income levels depends on relative market access and local market size, piece-wise integration causes insider-outsider divergence. Nonetheless, outsiders can gain in absolute terms if integration fosters the global growth rate. We also show that exclusion from a regional agreement and on-going transition have unpredictable joint effects on the structural adjustment, which might even exhibit a swinging behaviour. Such swings may imply large adjustment costs, which can be reduced by careful integration design. With this respect, the asymmetric phasing-out of trade barriers built into the Europe Agreements seems to work in the right direction. Finally, we point out that the predictions of the model in terms of direct investment and terms-of-trade dynamics are broadly consistent with some actual developments in transition economies.</p>"

<p>Consider a standard conjugate family of prior distributions for a vector-parameter indexing an exponential family. Two distinct model parameterizations may well lead to standard conjugate families which are not consistent, i.e. one family cannot be derived from the other by the usual change-of-variable technique. This raises the problem of finding suitable parameterizations that may lead to enriched conjugate families which are more flexible than the traditional ones. The previous remark motivates the definition of a new property for an exponential family, named conditional reducibility, Features of conditionally-reducible natural exponential families are investigated thoroughly. In particular, we relate this new property to the notion of cut, and show that conditionally-reducible families admit a reparameterization in terms of a vector having Likelihood-independent components. A general methodology to obtain enriched conjugate distributions for conditionally-reducible families is described in detail, generalizing previous works and more recent contributions in the area, The theory is illustrated with reference to natural exponential families having simple quadratic variance function.</p>"

<p>The Lorenz criterion of preferable distributions fails to distinguish adequately between convergence to the global mean and clustering around local means.

In this paper I build on this recent work by providing a new method that characterizes changes in the entire distribution, rather than focussing only on dispersion. In particular, the approach proposed offers a new decomposition method of within- and between-group components that differs from the classical method of additively decomposable inequality indices. The new method can monitor which factors modified the entire distribution, where precisely on the distribution these factors had an effect, and what determined the variation in the level of social distance between groups or geographic areas. Summary statistics of the observed movements and of distance between and divergence among the estimated and the counterfactual distributions are provided as well as a new index of social distance. The new method is then applied to Italian data on income distribution between 1987 and 1995.</p>"

<p>We study the effects of 'globalization' on income inequality in an economy where sellers with higher skills enjoy larger market shares and higher earnings. In our 'global' economy: (a) innovations in production and communication technologies enable suppliers to reach a larger mass of consumers and to improve the (perceived) quality of their products, and (b) trade barriers fall. When transport costs fall, income is redistributed away from the non-exporting to the exporting sector of the economy. As the latter turns out to employ workers of higher skill and pay, the effect is to raise wage inequality. Whether the least skilled stand to lose or gain from improved production or communication technologies, in contrast, depends on how technological change relates with skills. The model provides an intuitive explanation for why changes in wage premia are significantly associated with the export status of firms in recent firm-level empirical investigations.

<p>The European financial services sector is confronted with major forces that have changed its competitive dynamics and the strategic context. Firstly, we investigate the pace of the diffusion of two forces for strategic renewal (technological innovations and regulatory changes); secondly, we assess similarities in the pace of diffusion across countries; and thirdly, we assess the impact of these developments on the European financial landscape, focusing on five EU countries from 1990 to 1999. Preliminary findings suggest that country-specific patterns of diffusion have decreased substantially, indicating the emergence of industry-generic patterns of diffusion, while the speed of diffusion is increasing within the sector. This will give rise to a hyper-competitive landscape in the beginning of this century. Understanding the emergence of such landscapes creates important managerial challenges for the strategic renewal journeys of both incumbent firms and new entrants, in the financial services sector and in sectors confronted with similar developments.

<p>Global patterns of FDI and trade are remarkably similar, yet mainstay theory has them as substitutes. We posit a model where multiproduct, final-goods firms simultaneously engage in intraindustry FDI and intraindustry trade. The logic behind this two-way FDI is analogous to that of two-way trade in the Brander-Krugman reciprocal-dumping model. Namely, multiproduct firms use tmde costs to reduce inter-variety competition by placing production of some varieties abroad. Since the varieties are differentiated, all varieties are sold in all markets, Thus while FDI displaces some exports, it also creates trade via reverse imports. This naturally leads to parallelism in the trade and FDI patterns. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Objective: To assess and compare the incremental costs of the 15-day treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) with nimesulide vs that with diclofenac in France, Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>Design: A cost-minimisation analysis was performed through a decision tree, assuming the National Health System perspective. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events (GIAEs) in patients with OA treated with nimesulide or diclofenac.</p>
<p>Results: Three studies were included in the meta-analysis, which included a sample size of 484 patients in total. The incidence of GIAEs is higher in patients treated with diclofenac than in those treated with nimesulide. Nimesulide is cost-saving in all three countries: treatment costs are reduced by Eurodollars (EUR) 1.5 per case in France, EUR2 in Italy and EUR3.6 in Spain. Final results are not sensitive to variation of incidence rates of gastric and intestinal events and to changes in the resource consumption: nimesulide always remains cost-saving.</p>
<p>Conclusions: This is the first economic analysis carried out in three different countries on original epidemiological data comparing nimesulide and diclofenac directly. Projecting our results to the estimated OA prevalence in the entire population of the three countries, the expected savings to the NHS would vary from a minimum of EUR 17 500 000 in France to a maximum of EUR30 000 000 in Spain. It can be stated that these findings can provide support for clinicians and policy-makers for the adoption of this cost-saving treatment strategy in patients with OA.</p>"

<p>A dynamic model of migration is developed to study whether labor mobility can hedge people against region-specific shocks, making private or public insurance redundant. The model adopts a novel timing for migration, which is argued to be the time frame suitable for analyzing risk-sharing issues. It also innovates on the existing literature by solving individual migration through convexification of the set of actions. The results show that the role of migration as an insurance mechanism is small: labor mobility cannot fully remove income differentials between regions. It is also shown that a fiscal stabilization scheme is, in general, optimal; moreover, any pure risk-sharing mechanism has no influence on migration flows.</p>"

<p>This paper provides additional evidence on the relationship between corporate taxes and debt using panel data on Italian companies. The panel covers 1054 companies for the years 1982-1994.</p>
<p>The paper follows the Graham-Shevlin methodology for calculating company specific marginal tax rates (MTR) relying on the non-linearity of corporate tax schedules resulting from company losses and the ensuing tax provisions (carry-forward and backward rules). In the period covered by the panel there were in Italy two taxes on corporate income (IRPEG and ILOR), with different loss carry-forward rules, whose statutory tax rates and tax bases changed several times. For these reasons the simulated MTRs display both cross-sectional and time-series variation.</p>
<p>The paper tests whether taxes encourage the use of debt by analysing incremental financing decisions. In order to cope with the endogeneity of the MTR the paper considers two different specifications. The first uses the lagged value of the simulated MTR. The second employs the estimate of before-financing MTR proposed by Graham et al. (1998). Significant cross-sectional tax effects are identified under both specifications whereas time-series variation cannot be identified if due account is taken of firm-fixed tax effects.</p>
<p>The paper also investigates whether personal taxes affect corporate financing decisions. The MTR may either overstate or understate the fiscal benefit of debt financing according to whether, at the personal level, interest income is taxed at a rate that is higher or lower than the tax rate on returns from common stocks. Differences in the dividend-payout ratio across companies and several reforms in interest, dividend and capital gains taxation provide sufficient cross-section and time-series variations to identify the effect of personal taxes on debt usage.</p>"

The method provides an index that can be used both to calculate the distance between social groups classified according to worker characteristics and to track changes across time. The new method also reveals the factors that are reshaping the wage distribution and allows us to identify precisely where these effects are having their greatest impact.</p>"

<p>This article provides a critical discussion of the recent econometric literature on ""localised knowledge spillovers"" and the related notion of tacit knowledge.

Following some recent advances in the economics of knowledge, the article also suggests that more research efforts should instead be devoted to exploring how knowledge is actually transmitted, among whom, at what distance, and on the basis of which codebooks.</p>"

<p>This paper examines the persistence of innovative activities at the firm level in a comparative perspective. A new data set is used composed of six panel data, one for each of the following countries: France, Germany, Italy, UK, Japan and the USA. For each country, we use data on patent applications to the European Patent Office in the period 1978-1993 by 1200-1400 manufacturing firms. Using a transition probability matrix (TPM) approach, we find evidence for the existence of persistence in innovative activities, although, it is not very high in the aggregate and it declines as time goes by. However, both great innovators and non-innovators have a high probability to remain in their state and persistent innovators originate a disproportionate share of innovative activities. In this sense, persistence in innovative activities is quite strong.</p>
<p>These tendencies apply to all countries considered here, although, clear country-specific properties are observed. Moreover, there is heterogeneity also across industrial and size classification. Intersectoral differences are invariant across countries, suggesting that persistence is (at least partly) a technology-specific variable. Persistence tends to increase with firm size, but the relationship between firms' size and persistence is strongly-country-specific and it is not a simple one. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

<p>The standard real business cycle literature mainly focuses on Walrasian models designed to fit the U.S. institutional framework. Differences between the United States and Europe, mostly evident in the labor market, suggest that a purely Walrasian model may be inappropriate for the study of European business cycles. I present a stochastic version of the dynamic general equilibrium model of Daveri and Maffezzoli (2000, ""A Numerical Approach to Fiscal Policy, Unemployment and Growth in Europe,"" Econometrics and Applied Economics Working Paper 2000-4, IEP Universita Bocconi), where unemployment is generated by monopolistic unions, and calibrate it to reproduce several long-run features of the Italian and U.S. economics. This framework is then compared with an indivisible labor model built on Hansen (1985, Journal of Monetary Economics 16, 309-328) and Rogerson and Wright (1988, Journal of Monetary Economics 22, 501-515). I focus on the impulse response functions, the standard business cycle statistics, and the ability to reproduce the cyclical components of the main macroeconomic variables. The main results are as follows: (i) the impulse response functions of the monopoly union (MU) model show a higher degree of overall persistence; (ii) the business cycle statistics are similar; (iii) the MU model enjoys a statistically significant advantage in reproducing the Italian business cycle, but not that of the United States.

<p>After decades of standstill in both strategic and competitive practices within industry borders, the airport business has recently shown proof of new proactive, marketing-driven approaches towards the market.

This kind of enterprise seems, in its best practices, capable of serving various demand clusters with an array of different value propositions: attractions for tourists and aviation enthusiasts, congressional and logistic facilities, shopping venues and consulting services appear the most relevant ones. This paper investigates the evolving profile of airports towards the ""airport as a firm"" concept. This goal has been achieved through the implementation of more complex forms of service packages in order to satisfy evolving needs of enriched audiences, rather than identifying with the traditional audience, air passengers and air transport employees only.

<p>In the 1990s, the Italian National Health Service (INHS) experienced a major reform introducing regionalization, quasi-markets and managerialism. The combination of quasi-markets and regionalization has produced an interesting scenario: 21 Regional Governments designing their own organizational and funding models to achieve the desired combination of equity, efficiency, freedom of choice and cost containment. This paper reports the results of a research project carried out in 1998-99 to identify such models, verify their actual states of implementation and analyse the resulting incentives for individual health-care organizations. Overall, most Regions have designed their models according to the 'LHU-centred' template, under which most public hospitals remain under Local Health Unit (LHU) control, LHUs are funded by their Regions on a capitation basis and each LHU is expected to reimburse other LHUs, Independent INHS Hospitals (IHs) and accredited private providers for services supplied to its residents. Reimbursements are activity-based according to Regional fee schedules. The major exception is Lombardy, Italy's largest and wealthiest Region, which has formally opted for the 'purchaser-provider split' template, with LHUs acting mostly as purchasers while IHs and accredited private professionals and organizations act as providers. In practice, however, many Regions still show significant features of the traditional cost-reimbursement system. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>The paper re-examines the twin concepts of knowledge ""tacitness"" and ""codification"", which both the literature on (broadly defined) industrial districts, and some recent econometric literature on ""localized knowledge spillovers"" have possibly mis-handled. Even within specialized local small and medium enterprises (SMEs) clusters, knowledge may be highly codified and firm-specific. The case study on Brescia mechanical firms shows that knowledge, rather than flowing freely within the cluster boundaries, circulates within a few smaller ""epistemic communities"", each centered around the mechanical engineers of individual machine producers, and spanning to a selected number of suppliers' and customers' technicians. Physical distance among members of each community vary a lot, but even local messages may be highly codified. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>The value of a firm evolves in time, according to a standard Ito's stochastic differential equation, and under different types of financial support. In particular both the cases of legal and illegal financing are considered. The ruin/success probabilities for the firm are evaluated in closed form via special functions in the various settings. Some functionals of the process, which are relevant from the viewpoint of the financiers, (via Kac's lemma) are shown to obey a PDE, which is studied both with analytic tools (second-order ODEs of hypergeometric type) and with numerical ones. The case of insufficient payments is analyzed via stochastic calculus and a new model for loan renegotiation is offered. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Technological Specialization in Industrial Countries Patterns and Dynamics. - This paper employs distribution dynamics and patent data to study the empirical dynamics of technological specialization in industrial countries. Large countries spread innovation activities across a wider range of technologies, and their specialization level in a field displays lower probability to move around its initial level (country size effects). Mobility is high and asymmetric: it is difficult to improve specialization in very disadvantaged technologies, while high comparative advantages revert towards lower specialization levels. These findings undermine the theory of technological accumulation and path dependence, its implication of persistence in trade specialization patterns and the effectiveness of targeted industrial and technology policies.</p>"

<p>This paper focuses on multinational companies' creation of linkages with local firms in the electronics industry. Evidence is drawn from a novel data-set, covering international operations of the top European and US electronics companies, over the period 1984-95. Econometric tests are provided to highlight how firms' multinational experience, measured by the extent of their presence in foreign countries, affects cooperative agreements, as opposed to licensing and foreign direct investments. It is highlighted that multinationals' subsidiary accumulation has a positive and significant impact on collaborative linkages with local firms. This contrasts with the transaction cost view underlying most market-entry literature, but is consistent with a dynamic efficiency perspective which emphasises the role of linkages in learning and knowledge accumulation and exploitation.</p>"

<p>The net-present-value rule is a pillar of modern finance theory. As known, it is a capital budgeting rule. Finance theory prescribes the investor to compare the opportunity in hand with an asset of equivalent risk, i.e. to discount cash flows with a risk-adjusted rate of return. This paper aims at showing that inconsistencies and antinomies arise when applying the above-mentioned rule. Further, it turns out that it is actually impossible to compare alternatives equivalent in risk and any decision maker cannot prevent herself to violate the above tenet.

<p>Objectives To estimate the socio-economic impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Italy. Methods Outpatients with MS were enrolled at 44 centres across Italy. Socio-demographic, clinical and resource utilization data were collected using a validated questionnaire. Each patient completed a weekly diary of expenses due to MS over a three-month period. Direct health care costs and indirect costs (lack of productivity for the patient and for caregivers) were assessed for the whole population and were compared among five groups, categorised by disease severity (EDSS score). An analysis of variance was carried out on socio-demographic variables. Results For the total population of 566 patients, the mean direct cost over three months was ITL 2,134,000, the mean indirect cost was ITL 7,775,000. Costs were significantly higher for male patients (p < 0.05) and showed a significant increase with increasing age (p < 0.0005), disease duration (p < 0.0005) and disease severity (p < 0.0005). Costs for patients in a progressive phase were significantly higher (p < 0.0005). There were no significant geographical differences among the regions of Italy. Conclusions This study confirms that MS represents a high economic burden, with indirect costs greatly exceeding direct costs. Unpaid caregivers remain the culturally accepted mode of care for MS patients in Italy and this study illustrates the impact of their loss of earnings. As costs increase with disease progression, these findings suggest that treatment efforts should focus on patients in the early stages of MS, in order to slow down disease progression.</p>"

<p>In today's hypercompetitive environment, new sources of product and process innovation are continually being sought to reinforce companies' competitive advantages. In the recent past, the digital revolution inspired new managerial applications to strengthen positions within market arenas. In the case of airlines, early web applications were in the form of asynchronous sites, where customers could get little more than the same information on timetables and fares provided by travel agents albeit in new formats. Later, carriers started selling tickets on the web to make use of the cheaper distribution channel than the standard computer reservation systems (CRSs). Today, Internet potentially permits carriers to LT,et significant economic and competitive benefits beyond those simply coming from e-commerce. A wider e-business perspective may assure a one-to-one relationship with target customers, with a consequential fine-tuning of a firm's system offer. At the same time, carriers may exploit the significant cost savings from their procurement processes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>In this paper, we reconsider the theoretical basis for the Lucas critique from the point of view of robust decision theory. We first emphasize that the Lucas critique rests on a weak theoretical paradigm in that it fails to consider the motivation for the policy change by the government and hence inconsistently assumes limited rationality by the government. When placed in a proper dynamic general equilibrium framework of a dynamic game between the government and the private sector, much of the force of the critique simply vanishes. We also reconsider the critique by adopting an alternative theoretical paradigm and notion of rationality based on robust decision theory. This view of rationality might be regarded as more relevant than the nonrobust rationality employed by Lucas and, critically, it is one in which the Lucas critique can be shown simply not to apply, provided the private sector has adopted suitably robust decision rules.</p>"

<p>Design is defined as a strategic competency that can be utilized in order to create new objects, artifacts (i.e. products), systems and services, starting with some idea about customer needs. Since the products and services from the design process are of strategic importance to the company, design knowledge itself can become a strategic asset. Although one might expect design to be an internal resource from the point of view of transaction costs, most companies only possess some design competencies and acquire creative design skills from design consultants. The important issue is hone: they delineate what is strategic and what is not strategic, but skills. The article is based on two case studies from the furniture industry in which the companies have found different solutions. In the paper we therefore explain the differences in terms of the resource-based view on strategy. This indicates different conceptions of design resources, operating in different, but comparable contexts.</p>"

<p>This paper studies net employment growth across 21 OECD economies since 1980, focusing on the wide range of experiences within the European Union. The initial composition of employment across sectors is relevant in a few countries, but can only partially account for cross-country differences in net employment growth. Institutions play a more important role. A policy package including low dismissal costs and low taxation is significantly, associated with high net employment growth and can account for a substantial share of cross-country differences. While the Netherlands' employment miracle is largely accounted for by an increase in part-time jobs for women aged 25-49 in the services sector, we find that in the whole sample part-time jobs largely replace full-time jobs, and temporary jobs replace permanent jobs, with small net effects on hours worked. Continental Europe did not increase employment as much as other OECD countries until the mid-1990s, but later appears to be staging a resurgence of employment growth. We argue that this resurgence is not merely cyclical, is likely related to reforms, and may well be there to stay.</p>"

<p>Venture capital is considered to be the most appropriate form of financing for innovative firms in high-tech sectors. Venture capital has greatly developed over the last three decades in the United States, but much less so in Europe, where policy-makers are striving to help channel more funds into this form of financial intermediation. In this paper we provide the first assessment of venture capital in Europe. We document its development in the 1990s and compare it with that of American venture capital. We find the wedge between them to be large and growing. We then look at the involvement of venture capital with some of Europe's most innovative and successful companies, those listed on Europe's 'new' stock markets. Venture capital is effective in helping these firms overcome credit constraints, and thus to be born in the first place. Using a unique, hand collected data set from the listing prospectuses and annual reports of these companies, we find European venture capital to have a limited effect on their ability to raise equity capital, grow, and createjobs. We conclude that public support of the European venture capital industry should look at both its growth and at its maturation.</p>"

<p>This paper examines whether the supervisory objective of strengthening market discipline is compatible with the one of enhancing competitive equality for internationally active banks. This issue is empirically investigated by comparing the determinants of major US and European banks' subordinated notes and debentures (SND) spreads. Three main results emerge. First, the spread/rating relationship is both statistically significant and very similar for US and European banks' bonds. Second, US banks tend to pay a higher average spread on their SND issues because of a poorer average rating. This is due to the presence of European public sector banks, i.e. banks which are either government owned or benefit from explicit government guarantees. In fact, US banks have slightly better Moody's bank financial strength and FitchIBCA individual average ratings, which omit the influence of government and other external support on risk borne by investors. Finally, controlling for the issuing banks' default risk, US banks pay a statistically significant lower average spread on their SND issues. This result is attributed to the higher liquidity of the US market for banks' bonds. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>At times knowledge can be seen as the source of organizational innovation and change-at other times, however, it can be the very constraint on that change. This conflicted role offers insights into why the phenomenon of organizational knowledge has been interpreted by researchers in multiple and possibly conflicting ways. Some theories depict knowledge as an empirical phenomenon, residing in action and becoming ""organizational"" in the acquisition. diffusion, and replication of those actions throughout the organization. Others consider it a latent phenomenon, residing in the possibility for constructing novel organizational actions. This paper argues that while each of these qualities-empirical and latent-are intrinsic to knowledge in organizations. our understanding of organizational phenomena is essentially incomplete until the relationship between them is considered. Building on structuration theory. we propose a complementary perspective that views organizational knowledge as the product of an ongoing and recursive interaction between empirical and latent knowledge. between knowledge as action and knowledge as possibility. We ground this complementary model of knowledge in evidence from the field study of two firms whose innovation practices provide unique insights into how knowledge simultaneously enables and constrains behavior in organizations. We then discuss how a complementary perspective avoids the reification of knowledge by depicting it instead as an ongoing and social process and offers an alternative distinction between individual and collective knowledge.</p>"

<p>The Choquet expected utility model deals with nonadditive probabilities (or capacities). Their dependence on the information the decision-maker has about the possibility of the events is taken into account. Two kinds of information are examined: interval information (for instance, the percentage of white balls in an urn is between 60% and 100%) and comparative information (for instance, the information that there are more white balls than black ones). Some implications are shown with regard to the core of the capacity and to two additive measures which can be derived from capacities: the Shapley value and the nucleolus. Interval information bounds prove to be satisfied by all probabilities in the core, but they are not necessarily satisfied by the nucleolus (when the core is empty) and the Shapley value. We must introduce the constrained nucleolus in order for these bounds to be satisfied, while the Shapley value does not seem to be adjustable. On the contrary, comparative information inequalities prove to be not necessarily satisfied by all probabilities in the core and we must introduce the constrained core in order for these inequalities be satisfied. However, both the nucleolus and the Shapley value satisfy the comparative information inequalities, and the Shapley value does it more strictly than the nucleolus.</p>"

<p>This article proposes a new model for measuring the digital divide within a set of countries or geographical areas. Starting from a series of elementary indicators the methodology groups these indicators into six factors of digitalization and, subsequently, aggregates the factors in a synthetic index called the synthetic index of digitalization. The dispersion in the distribution of the synthetic indexes of digitalization constitutes the measure of the digital divide. This method is based upon a measurement approach, which is different from the ones previously developed, since it uses principal components analysis for aggregating the variables and avoids many of the problems and limits shown by existing models. In the article an application of the methodology is provided within a set of ten developed countries for 2000 and 2001. The measurement framework for the digital divide presented here reveals new policy implications for public institutions and highlights opportunities and risks for managers working in the 'digital economy' environment.</p>"

<p>This paper tests for the presence of non-linearities in the propagation of devaluation expectations among the countries that were members of the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS. We show that whenever it is possible to estimate a model for financial interdependence, a full-information technique to detect such non-linearities is more efficient than the limited-information estimator proposed, in a similar context, by Rigobon (2000). This happens, in particular, when the periods of market turbulence are relatively short. Our evidence suggests that non-linearities in the propagation of devaluation expectations were a general phenomenon in the ERM. Normally the non-linearity amounts to a stronger effect in the same direction, but sometimes, as in the Dutch case, it implies a significant effect in the opposite direction: evidence of flight-to-quality.

<p>We study the stylized plant renewal problem when the plant net present value is maximized through the choice of the renewal dates or plant's lives, assuming that the number of renewals - and then the horizon - is finite. We observe that, under various assumptions about the cash-flow profiles due to the plants, their optimal life lengths are almost constant: this simplifies the renewal decisions. First we provide numerical and analytical explanations of the phenomenon. Then we compare the constant plant life in the finite horizon case and the stationary length in the infinite horizon one. We show that a finite horizon problem cannot be approximated by an infinite one, since the optimality conditions which provide, respectively, the constant and the stationary length are inconsistent. The usual shortcut for assuming an infinite horizon instead of the true, finite one, is then incorrect: on the contrary simplifications in the renewal problem can come from the constancy of the finite horizon optimal plant life.

<p>With the creation of European monetary union (EMU), European welfare states have entered a new phase of development. The margins for manoeuvring public budgets have substantially decreased, while the unfolding of the four freedoms of movement within the European union (EU) have seriously weakened the traditional coercive monopoly of the state on actors and resources that are crucial for the stability of redistributive institutions. The article explores these issues adopting a Rokkanian perspective, i.e, building on Rokkan's pioneering insights on the nexus between boundary building and internal structuring. The first part of the paper briefly presents the theoretical perspective. The second pari sketches the development of national welfare institutions from their origin up to the early 1970. The third part describes the challenges that have emerged to the ""social sovereignty"" of the nation state, largely linked to the process of European integration. The final part offers some more speculative remarks of the potential de-structuring of the traditional architecture of social protection, with some hints at cross-national variations and possible developments at the EU level.</p>"

<p>Both individual experiences and community characteristics influence how much people trust each other. Using individual level data drawn from US localities we find that the strongest factors associated with low trust are: (i) a recent history of traumatic experiences; (ii) belonging to a group that historically felt discriminated against, such as minorities (blacks in particular) and, to a lesser extent, women; (iii) being economically unsuccessful in terms of income and education; (iv) living in a racially mixed community and/or in one with a high degree of income disparity. Religious beliefs and ethnic origins do not significantly affect trust. The role of racial cleavages leading to low trust is confirmed when we explicitly account for individual preferences on inter racial relationships: within the same community, individuals who express stronger feelings against racial integration trust relatively less the more racially heterogeneous the community is.

<p>This paper investigates the determinants of group membership, and in particular the effect of income inequality on individual incentives to join economic groups. Drawing on a simple model, we show that an increase in inequality has an ambiguous effect and that the type of access rule (open versus restricted access) is key in determining what income categories are represented in the group. Furthermore, the shape of the income distribution can be crucial to determine whether increased inequality leads to more or less group participation. Using survey data from rural Tanzania we find that inequality at the village level has a negative impact on the likelihood that the respondents are members of any group. This effect is particularly significant for relatively wealthier people, both when relative wealth is 'objectively' measured, and when it is 'subjectively' defined. However, when we disaggregate groups by type of access rule, we find that inequality decreases participation in open access groups when there are wide disparities at the bottom of the distribution, while it increases participation in restricted access groups when the disparities are around the middle and top part of the distribution. Finally, we assess the impact of inequality on various dimensions of group functioning. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Why are social security transfers associated with retirement rules? This paper focuses on the political interactions between retirement and social security. Using a probabilistic voting approach, it analyzes why old people are induced to retire in order to receive pension transfers from the young. A crucial hypothesis is that leisure in old age represents a ""merit good,"" which is positively valued by all agents in the society, young and old. Thus, the politicians choose to tax the labor income of the old, to induce them to retire. Retirement increases the level of ideological homogeneity of the old. In fact, once retired, the elderly are more ""single-minded,"" since they only care about redistributive issues, such as pensions. This increase in their political power allows them to win the political game and to receive a positive transfer from the young (social security).</p>"

<p>Objective Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and disabling disease frequently leading to physical and psychological dependence, with considerable economic consequences. The aim of our study was to perform a cost-of-illness analysis for RA according to the four different levels of functional RA severity</p>
<p>Methods Direct costs (hospitalisations, treatments, diagnostics and the non-medical costs), indirect costs (productivity losses and informal care), and intangible costs (deterioration in the quality of life of patients, their families and friends assessed by the Medical Outcome Survey Short Form and the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire) were measured in 200 RA patients.</p>
<p>Results The social costs - direct plus indirect costs - increased as RA worsened. The direct costs increase very significantly (p < 0.0005) among the four functional classes (respectively Euro 1643.4 - 2910.2 - 4236.5 - 5696.8), likewise the indirect costs (respectively Euro 2704.9 - 9566.4 - 12183.1 - 17249.2). Moreover social costs, analysed independently from the functional classes, are significantly higher in patients with other concomitant diseases. As far as the intangible costs are concerned, for all the areas explored by the scales used, the high impact of RA on the quality of life of RA patients was markedly evident. Female gender and co-morbidity are associated with higher costs.</p>
<p>Conclusions In Italy, the indirect costs account for the highest cost for management of RA patients. Considering that costs increase with RA progression, the patients who show a rapid evolution of the functional damages should be identified early based on risk indicators.</p>"

Traditionally, they have been perceived as major contributors to environmental degradation and their task is to find innovative solutions to minimise pollution. However, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) represent more than 80% of enterprises operating throughout Europe and this identifies them as significant contributors to environmental problems. This paper, based upon the findings of two research projects funded by the European Commission, focuses on SMEs' potential to innovate environmentally and the role they can play in minimising industry's environmental impact. It identifies the barriers, motivating factors and benefits experienced by SMEs and places emphasis on effective networking as a support for environmental innovation.</p>"

<p>Let X be a chain with discrete state space I, and V be the matrix of entries Vi., where Vi.,, denotes the position of the process immediately after the nth visit to i. We prove that the law of X is a mixture of laws of Markov chains if and only if the distribution of V is invariant under finite permutations within rows (i.e., the V-i,V-n's are partially exchangeable in the sense of de Finetti). We also prove that an analogous statement holds true for mixtures of laws of Markov chains with a general state space and atomic kernels. Going back to the discrete case, we analyze the relationships between partial exchangeability of V and Markov exchangeability in the sense of Diaconis and Freedman. The main statement is that the former is stronger than the latter, but the two are equivalent under the assumption of recurrence. Combination of this equivalence with the aforesaid representation theorem gives the Diaconis and Freedman basic result for mixtures of Markov chains. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The model examines the relationships between the nature of the search space, demand, the patterns of competition, and industry evolution in the age of random screening and in the age of molecular biology, and shows that concentration in the pharmaceutical industry is shaped by lack of cumulativeness in innovative activities and market fragmentation. The model conforms to our appreciative understanding and responds to changes in parameters concerning demand, costs, economies of scale, opportunity conditions and the relative advantages of new biotechnology firms (NBFs) vis-a-vis incumbents. With the exception of cost increases, the model is quite robust to these changes in its essential features: it is quite difficult to raise substantially concentration and to have NBFs displacing incumbents.</p>"

<p>We study the emergence of trust behavior at both the individual and the population levels. At the individual level, in contrast to prior research that views trust as a fixed trait, we model the emergence of trust or cooperation as a result of trial and error learning by a computer algorithm borrowed from the field of artificial intelligence ( Watkins 1989). We show that trust can indeed arise as a result of trial and error learning. Emergence of trust at the population level is modeled by a grid-world consisting of cells of individual agents, a technique known as spatialization in evolutionary game theory. We show that, under a wide range of assumptions, trusting individuals tend to take over the population and trust becomes a systematic property. At both individual and population levels, therefore, we argue that trust behaviors will often emerge as a result of learning.</p>"

<p>This paper examines public debt management during episodes of fiscal stabilization when long-term interest rates are generally higher than governments' expectations of future rates. We find that governments increase the share of fixed-rate long-term debt denominated in the domestic currency, the higher is the conditional volatility of short-term interest rates, the lower are long-term interest rates, and the stronger is the fall in long-term rates that follows the announcement of the stabilization program. This evidence suggests that governments tend to prefer long to short maturity debt because they are concerned about refinancing risk. However, when long-term rates are high relative to their expectations, they issue short maturity debt to minimize borrowing costs.</p>"

Such certificates will be delivered for 8 years for electricity production to renewable power plants commissioned after 31 March 1999. All the electricity production based on non-renewable energy sources and import have an obligation to cover 2% of its total with Green Certificates. This support mechanism is open to foreign production, but only from countries with reciprocal opportunities for Italian production. The new market has formally started on January 2002, even if some important rules have not yet been defined.

The analytical exploration of this problem has originated a general method to deduce from inequalities for distribution functions, which are based on the expected value, related tail inequalities, which are particularly useful for VaR problems, where only one tail is involved.

We show that hanks may act as catalysts for industrialization provided they are sufficiently large to mobilize a critical mass of firms and that they posses sufficient market pokier to make profits from coordination, The theory provides simple conditions that help explain why banks seem to play a creative role in some but not in other emerging markets.

The hypothesis is tested that firms extend the range of their innovative activities in a non-random way. Specifically, we test the extent to which firms diversify their innovative activities across related technological fields, i.e. fields that share a common knowledge base and rely upon common heuristics and scientific principles. The paper proposes an original measure of knowledge-relatedness, using co-classification codes contained in patent documents, and examines the patterns of technological diversification of the whole population of firms from the United States, Italy, France, UK, Germany, and Japan patenting to the European Patent Office from 1982 to 1993. Robust evidence is found that knowledge-relatedness is a major feature of firms' innovative activities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>On average the expected value at the moment of commercialization of an R&D project should remain constant during the different stages of new product development. Contrary to this intuition however, a systematic, non-constant pattern is found in the average expected value of an R&D project. First, the value declines after the initial screening, then rises after the first market analysis, but on average does not reach the initial level at the final stage of development when resources for market introduction are approved. Moreover, uncertainty about the project value declines over time. The findings suggest a V-shaped value function of R&D projects. The study seems to be the first attempt to make direct measurements of valuing R&D projects through time in a real managerial setting.</p>"

<p>Previous research has identified goal setting as an important determinant of the performance of teams with innovative tasks. This study aims to further the understanding of how teams successfully perform goal setting given the collaborative nature of innovative projects. The authors argue that the quality of teamwork serves as an important facilitator to the successful enactment of goal setting in team projects. Using data from 575 members, leaders, and managers of 145 software development teams, they test direct and moderated relationships between goal setting and effectiveness (quality) and efficiency (schedule, budget). Results indicate that goal setting is directly related to both effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, hierarchical regression analyses show that teamwork quality moderates these relationships. Implications for research and practice are discussed.</p>"

<p>This paper compares several time series methods for short-run forecasting of Euro-wide inflation and real activity using data from 1982 to 1997. Forecasts are constructed from univariate autoregressions, vector autoregressions, single equation models that include Euro-wide and US aggregates, and large-model methods in which forecasts are based on estimates of common dynamic factors. Aggregate Euro-wide forecasts are constructed from models that utilize only aggregate Euro-wide variables and by aggregating country-specific models. The,results suggest that forecasts constructed by aggregating the country-specific models are more accurate than forecasts constructed using the aggregate data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

<p>Lowest-low fertility, defined as a period total fertility rate at or below 1.3, has rapidly spread in Europe during the 1990s. This article traces the emergence of this new phenomenon to the interaction of five factors. First, tempo and compositional distortions reduce the total fertility rate below the associated level of cohort fertility. Second, socioeconomic changes-including increased returns to human capital and high economic uncertainty in early adulthood-have made late childbearing a rational response for individuals and couples. Third, social interaction effects reinforce this behavioral adjustment and contribute to large and persistent postponement in the mean age at birth. Fourth, institutional settings favor an overall low quantum of fertility. Fifth, postponement-quantum interactions amplify the consequences of this institutional setting when combined with ongoing delays of childbearing. The article concludes with speculations about future trends in current and prospective lowest-low-fertility countries.</p>"

<p>This paper investigates the recent evolution of five Eastern European exchange rates.

We propose a non-linear specification where the non-linearity refers to the effect of the interest rate differential. The paper supports the view that given the relevance of capital flows and their sensitivity to risk adjusted yield differentials, the choice of exchange rate regime should be a matter of careful strategy.</p>"

<p>We introduce a stochastic process based on nonhomogeneous Poisson processes and urn processes which can be reinforced to produce a mixture of semi-Markov processes. By working with the notion of exchangeable blocks within the process, we present a Bayesian nonparametric framework for handling data which arises in the form of a semi-Markov process. That is, if units provide information as a semi-Markov process and units are regarded as being exchangeable then we show how to construct the sequence of predictive distributions without explicit reference to the de Finetti measure, or prior.

<p>Generous early retirement provisions account for a large proportion of the drop in the labor force participation of elderly workers. The aim of this paper is to provide a positive theory of early retirement. We suggest that the political support for generous early retirement provisions relies on: (i) the existence of a significant group of elderly workers with incomplete working history, who are not entitled to an old age pension; and (ii) the intragenerational redistribution built in this provision via the utility from leisure that induces low-ability workers to retire early. The majority which supports early retirement in a bidimensional voting game is composed of elderly with incomplete working history and low-ability workers; social security is supported by retirees and low-ability workers.

<p>The aim of the paper is to investigate the joint redistributive effects of migration and pensions and to reassess the sustainability issue raised in the existing economic literature. The paper first develops a theoretical framework to analyse the impact of international migration on the labour market. The model allows for heterogeneity across native-born individuals and for migrants to affect both the wages and the education decision in the recipient country. It then explicitly focuses on pensions under alternative migration scenarios. The analysis shows that migration causes redistributive effects which increase across-group wage inequality. However, the endogenous educational response by residents partially offsets the redistributive impact of migration while creating additional interest groups. Migration helps the financial sustainability of the pension scheme but the interaction between migration and pensions causes complex inter- and intragenerational redistributive conflicts, which are analysed in the paper.

<p>In the recent process leading to the agreement on the digital versatile disc two product standards have been developed: one by Philips and Sony, and the other by Toshiba and Time Warner. Three actions in the process of standardization have startled business analysts. First, Matsushita's choice to support the Toshiba-Time Warner standard. Second, Sony's statement to unconditionally market the standard developed with Philips. Third, the unexpected agreement between parties on a uniform standard. We show that these moves in the game concerning the digital video standard should be viewed as a game within a larger game. The larger game encompasses the players' interest beyond the digital technology. We develop and apply a straightforward managerial framework for product standardization games that supports managers looking beyond the small game. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It illustrates the mechanics of the adjustments to the realization based capital gains tax and how far they diverge from the original proposals. The paper also draws attention to the administrative and political difficulties encountered in implementing the reform. These factors ultimately resulted in a repeal of retrospective taxation, and, in due course, may also entail the abolition of taxation on an accrual basis. The paper highlights the crucial role that financial intermediaries can play in lowering compliance costs under a proportional tax system and the effects on tax revenues.</p>"

<p>Although research on trust in an organizational context has advanced considerably in recent years, the literature has yet to produce a set of generalizable propositions that inform our understanding of the organization and coordination of work. We propose that conceptualizing trust as an organizing principle is a powerful way of integrating the diverse trust literature and distilling generalizable implications for how trust affects organizing. We develop the notion of trust as an organizing principle by specifying structuring and mobilizing as two sets of causal pathways through which trust influences several important properties of organizations. We further describe specific mechanisms within structuring and mobilizing that influence interaction patterns and organizational processes. The principal aim of the framework is to advance the literature by connecting the psychological and sociological micro-foundations of trust with the macro-bases of organizing. The paper concludes by demonstrating how the framework can be applied to yield novel insights into traditional views of organizations and to stimulate original and innovative avenues of organizational research that consider both the benefits and downsides of trust.</p>"

<p>The question of whether private investors can discriminate between the risk taken by banks is empirically investigated by testing the risk sensitivity of European banks' subordinated notes and debentures (SND) spreads. A unique dataset of spreads, ratings, and accounting measures of bank risk is used for a sample of SND issued during the 1991-2000:Q1 period. Moody's Bank Financial Strength (MBFS) and FitchIBCA Individual (FII) ratings, which omit the influence of government and other external support on risk borne by investors, are used as bank risk proxies together with accounting variables to explain the variability of spreads. Empirical results support the hypothesis that SND investors are sensitive to bank risk, with the exception of SND issued by public sector banks, i.e., government owned or guaranteed institutions. Results also show that the sensitivity of SND spreads to measures of stand-alone risk (i.e., measures that do not incorporate external guarantees) has been increasing from the first to the second part of the 1990s, with the perception of too-big-to-fail type guarantees by private investors gradually disappearing. This result can be attributed to the joint effect of the loss of monetary policy by national central banks and the public budget constraints imposed by the European Monetary Union (EMU).</p>"

<p>At times of discontinuous technological change co-operation represents a viable strategy for both incumbents and new-entrants, provided that the choice of cooperation is consistent with the firm's business strategy (market-pull and generalist vs. technology-push and specialist) and with its degree of organizational and technological flexibility. A clear understanding of these two elements constitutes a necessary managerial pre-requisite for an effective co-operative strategy. Evidence from the UK fibre-optics industry suggests that managers can choose between two ideal types of co-operation. On the one hand, structured co-operation involves highly engineered partnerships at the inter-organizational level designed to gain control over, or access to, the commercialisation of the new technology for standard applications in the wider market; on the other hand, unstructured co-operation relies on informal relationships between individuals in separate organizations, with the intention of sustaining the development of innovative applications of the new technology for specialist market niches. Being a new-entrant or an incumbent does not necessarily explain the type of co-operation adopted - but there is evidence that market-pull, generalist strategies and lower levels of technological and organizational flexibility are associated with structured co-operation, whereas technology-push, specialist strategies and higher levels of flexibility combine with co-operative strategies of the unstructured type.

<p>This paper analyses the current demand and market potential for Internet telephony-the transmission of voice over the public Internet or over a private Intranet-a technology that has attracted considerable attention as an appealing alternative to traditional telephony but that is likely to develop as a component within an integrated system of video, data and voice applications. The paper investigates technical, economic and social factors supporting and hindering the adoption of Internet telephony. In doing so, it relies upon the idea that the diffusion of Internet telephony is determined both by the attributes of the technological applications as perceived by the potential adopters, and by the characteristics of different users. According to this view, the research points out that relevant uncertainties reside on the demand side, particularly among residential users, and that in the future, businesses are more likely to adopt these applications than consumers. The assumptions concerning the future diffusion of Internet telephony are supported by the results of a survey carried out among a sample of Internet telephony service providers in Europe and North America.

<p>This paper offers a preliminary evaluation of ECB conduct of monetary policy by estimating a fairly general reaction function for the euro area. The specification of the policy rule embodies a number of nonlinearities which are shown to stem from asymmetric preferences and a convex aggregate supply curve. Asymmetric preferences allow, but do not require, policy-makers to weight differently positive and negative deviations of inflation and output from the reference values, and translate into an asymmetric reaction,function. The empirical analysis on monthly euro-area aggregated data over the last 5 years reveals that ECB monetary policy is effectively described by a nonlinear policy rule according to which output contractions have required a larger policy response than output expansions. Moreover, actual movements in the euro interest rate closely resemble the simulated path that a Bundesbank-type of behaviour would have implied.</p>"

<p>Osteoarthritis is one of the leading causes of disability. Among the available treatments, NSAIDs are the most common. The present paper reviews economic studies conducted in the last five years on the treatment of osteoarthritis in Europe. The majority focus on NSAID therapy, mainly comparing COX-2-specific inhibitors against COX non-specific inhibitors. The reviewed studies estimate healthcare costs only. The final results indicate that, owing to the lower incidence of adverse events, COX-2-specific inhibitors should now dominate over traditional NSAIDs. However, the differences found in the methods used to measure costs suggest that results should be interpreted with caution. To estimate costs, authors used diverse values that were not always consistent with the studies' perspective. Furthermore, many did not report resource consumption patterns, making comparisons among the studies difficult, as economic results are influenced by the price/charging policies of different countries. Economic evaluations have the potential to affect health policy by assisting the ranking and prioritisation obligations of decision makers. In this context, it is important to meet strict methodological guidelines.</p>"

<p>As today's digital technologies modify the ways in which cultural goods are consumed and produced, the analysis of consumption patterns becomes one of the most important activities for producers in the cultural industries. Information on consumers' behaviour becomes a strategic resource with which to anticipate competitors and improve the fit between supply and demand. This article contains an empirical analysis on the music industry, where analysis of on-line survey results show that music downloading is not a unique phenomenon and consumers are approaching the digital environment in different ways. The presence of these differing consumption profiles entails a deep segmentation strategy, requiring that both sides of the strategy - from selection of artists to promotion and pricing policies - be addressed to deal with this segmentation.

<p>We present a view of trust in boundary spanners as explained by the extent of role autonomy, a multidimensional concept that reflects the discretion that agents have in interpreting and enacting their roles. We argue that, in a buyer-supplier context, purchasing managers will be trusted to a greater extent by supplier representatives when they are free from constraints that limit their ability to interpret their boundary-spanning roles. We conceptualize and measure three key components of role autonomy: Functional influence, tenure, and clan culture. Taken together, these components of role autonomy shape and define the purchasing manager's willingness and capacity to make and uphold commitments to supplier representatives. Role autonomy permits purchasing managers to engage in discretionary behaviors that allow supplier representatives to learn about their underlying motives and intentions. We test hypotheses linking the components of role autonomy to trust on a sample of 119 buyer-supplier relationships. We use a dyadic research design that combines data from purchasing managers and supplier representatives. The results suggest that granting purchasing managers greater autonomy enhances supplier representative trust in purchasing managers. By drawing attention to role autonomy as a feature of organizations that influences trust we highlight the importance of organizational context in contributing to a deeper understanding of trust.</p>"

<p>We propose a Bayesian model for physiologically based pharmacokinetics of 1,3-butadiene (BD). BD is classified as a suspected human carcinogen and exposure to it is common, especially through cigarette smoke as well as in urban settings. The main aim of the methodology and analysis that are presented here is to quantify variability in the rates of BD metabolism by human subjects. A three-compartmental model is described, together with informative prior distributions for the population parameters, all of which represent real physiological variables. The model is described in detail along with the meanings and interpretations of the associated parameters. A four-compartment model is also given for comparison. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are described for fitting the model proposed. The model is fitted to toxicokinetic data obtained from 133 healthy subjects (males and females) from the four major racial groups in the USA, with ages ranging from 19 to 62 years. Subjects were exposed to 2 parts per million of BD for 20 min through a face mask by using a computer-controlled exposure and respiratory monitoring system. Stratification by ethnic group results in major changes in the physiological parameters. Sex and age were also tested but not found to have a significant effect.</p>"

<p>The rate of inflation in the U.S. has declined from an average of 4.5% in the period 1960-79 to an average of 3.6% in 1980-98. Between those two periods, the standard deviations of inflation and the output gap have also declined. These facts can be attributed to the interaction of three possible factors: a shift in central bank preferences, a reduction in the variability of aggregate supply shocks, and a more efficient conduct of monetary policy. In this paper we identify the relative roles of these factors. Our framework is based on the estimation of a small structural macro model for the U.S. economy jointly with the first order conditions, which solve the intertemporal optimization problem faced by the Fed. Overall, our results indicate that the policy preferences of the Fed, and in particular the (implicit) inflation target, have changed drastically with the advent of the Volcker-Greenspan era. In addition, we find that the variance of supply shocks has been lower and monetary policy has been conducted more efficiently during this period.</p>"

Product market regulation determines entry costs and the degree of competition. Labor market regulation determines the bargaining power of workers. We show the effects of deregulation. We then use our results to discuss the political economy of deregulation, and recent macroeconomic evolutions in Europe.</p>"

Different choices to model the relation between operated time and kilometres run are possible: in this paper the kilometres run are incorporated within the intensity function as a random function of time, modelled as a gamma process. Furthermore a periodic component is introduced to deal with the seasonality in the data. Bayesian inference is then carried out via Monte Carlo simulation, obtaining prediction intervals for the expected number of failures during periods of desired length, using only part of the data.

<p>We analyze the consequences of strategically sophisticated bidding without assuming equilibrium behavior. In particular, we characterize interim rationalizable bids in symmetric first-price auctions with interdependent values and affiliated signals. We show that (1) every nonzero bid below the equilibrium is rationalizable, (2) some bids above the equilibrium are rationalizable, (3) the upper bound on rationalizable bids of a given player is a nondecreasing function of her signal. In the special case of independent signals and quasi-linear valuation functions, (i) the least upper bound on rationalizable bids is concave; hence (ii) rationalizability implies substantial proportional shading for high valuations, but is consistent with negligible proportional shading for low valuations. We argue that our theoretical analysis may shed some light on experimental findings about deviations from the risk-neutral Nash equilibrium. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This article uses a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify the adverse health effects associated with in-utero exposure to methylmercury. By allowing for study-to-study as well as outcome-to-outcome variability, the approach provides a useful meta-analytic tool for multi-outcome, multi-study environmental risk assessments. The analysis presented here expands on the findings of a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) committee, charged with advising the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on an appropriate approach to conducting a risk assessment for methylmercury. The NAS committee, for which the senior author (Ryan) was a committee member, reviewed the findings from several conflicting studies and reported the results from a Bayesian hierarchical model that synthesized information across several studies and for several outcomes. Although the NAS committee did not suggest that the hierarchical model be used as the actual basis for a methylmercury risk assessment, the results from the model were used to justify and support the final recommendation that the risk analysis be based on data from a study conducted in the Faroe Islands, which had found an association between in-utero exposure to methylmercury and impaired neurological development. We consider a variety of statistical issues, but particularly sensitivity to model specification.</p>"

<p>When a firing litigation is taken to court, only the characteristics of the employee's misconduct should be relevant for the judge's decision. Using detailed data from an Italian bank and aggregate macro data, this paper shows that, instead, local labor market conditions influence the court's decision: The same misconduct episode may be considered sufficient for firing in a tight labor market but insufficient otherwise. We reach this conclusion after taking carefully into consideration the non-random selection of firing litigations for trial. Although these results refer to the specific situation considered, they raise more general issues. For macroeconomists they suggest that higher unemployment rates may increase firing costs via the effect on courts' decision criteria; thus, the real extent of firing rigidities cannot be assessed without considering the role of courts. For labor law scholars, these findings are important because, following traditional principles, the law should be applied in the same way for all citizens and over the entire national territory.

<p>This paper investigates welfare effects of subsidy competition for the location of a multinational enterprise. One of the competing regions benefits more from the inward investment but, in the absence of incentives, the multinational's preferred location is the other, more advanced region. The paper shows that subsidies, by making the multinational switch location, may increase aggregate welfare. If the multinational exports in the absence of incentives, the welfare effects of subsidy competition may look very different. Allowing subsidies attracts the direct investment, which otherwise would not take place, in one of the two regions. Further, it intensifies competition in the market. The paper shows that the welfare increasing role of incentives may be amplified, but also that the competition effect, by hurting domestic firms, may cancel out any other positive role of incentives.

<p>The study of cross-functional teams remains popular given the use of teams to integrate cross-functional expertise to achieve higher performance in innovative projects. A related stream of research shows that teams are associated with higher performance only in cases of highly innovative projects. Such research is based on the assumption that organizations can freely choose integration mechanisms on a project-by-project basis. However, this assumption is flawed in cases where organizations, such as software development laboratories, commit to a team-based organizational design on a more permanent basis. With software development teams working on projects with varying degrees of innovativeness, we investigate the effects of Hoegl and Gemuenden's (2001) measure of teamwork quality on the performance of teams with moderately and highly innovative projects. Using data from 575 members, leaders, and managers of 145 software development projects, results show that teamwork quality is associated with team efficiency (i.e., adherence to schedule and budget) only in projects posing high task innovativeness. The relationship between teamwork quality and team effectiveness (i.e., quality of outcome), however, is not moderated by task innovativeness. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

<p>What impact does ecological uncertainty have on agents' decisions concerning domestic emissions abatement, physical investments, and R&D expenditures? How sensitive are the answers to these questions when we move from exogenous to endogenous technical change? To investigate these issues we modify the ETC-RICE model described in Buonanno et al. ( 2001) by embedding in it a hazard rate function as in Bosello and Moretto ( 1999). With this model at hand we run numerical optimisations focusing our attention on the control variables of the representative agents, i.e., domestic abatement rate, investments in physical capital, and R&D spending, as well as on the endogenous patterns of GDP level and CO2 emissions. Our results show that uncertainty strongly influences agents behaviour; in particular, agents slow down their emissions in order to maintain a more sustainable growth path. In addition, R&D expenditures trigger the ""engine of growth"" exclusively when environmental technical change is formalized in an endogenous fashion. However, even if environmental uncertainty may stimulate technical change, long-run growth it turns out to be negatively affected by the former, as also predicted by Clarke and Reed ( 1994) Tsur and Zemel (1996) and Bosello and Moretto (1999).</p>"

<p>This paper builds upon and extends existing studies of scientific and technological specialisation by proposing an analytical framework to compare sectoral knowledge bases across countries. It develops the concepts of knowledge persistence and knowledge integration as the relevant dimensions along which knowledge bases can be compared. Persistence is studied by analysing the evolution of specialisation over time. It hints at the cumulative, path dependent nature of learning processes. Integration is studied by analysing the evolution of specialisation across different typologies of research. It hints at the complex, non-linear interdependencies that link the scientific and technological domains. On the strength of an original database encompassing 630,000 peer-reviewed papers published between 1989 and 1996 in I I chemistry and pharmacology-related fields across three types of research (i.e. basic, applied and development), it is argued that countries with high degrees of both persistence and integration (e.g. the US in pharmacology) are the most likely sources of useful research results for EU firms' innovative efforts in the pharmaceutical sector. Also, some doubts are cast on the existence of a European paradox in pharmaceuticals. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Reference analysis is one of the most successful general methods to derive noninformative prior distributions. In practice, however, reference priors are often difficult to obtain. Recently developed theory for conditionally reducible natural exponential families identifies an attractive reparameterization which allows one, among other things, to construct an enriched conjugate prior. In this paper, under the assumption that the variance function is simple quadratic, the order-invariant group reference prior for the above parameter is found. Furthermore, group reference priors for the mean- and natural parameter of the families are obtained. A brief discussion of the frequentist coverage properties is also presented. The theory is illustrated for the multinomial and negative-multinomial family. Posterior computations are especially straightforward due to the fact that the resulting reference distributions belong to the corresponding enriched conjugate family. A substantive application of the theory relates to the construction of reference priors for the Bayesian analysis of two-way contingency tables with respect to two alternative parameterizations.

<p>This paper studies kinship band networks as capital market institutions. Membership in a community where individuals are dynastically linked has two effects on informal credit. First, the nonanonymity of the dynastic link allows to sanction the defaulters' offspring and induce compliance even in short-term interactions (social enforcement). Second, preferential agreements can arise in which kin members condition their behavior on the characteristics of a player's predecessor, expecting others to do the same with their offspring (reciprocity).

<p>Individuals' knowledge networks are widely considered to contribute substantially to the effectiveness and efficiency of organizations. While the positive effects of knowledge networks as a primary driver of social capital have recently received considerable research attention, potential determinants of individuals' network building have not yet been adequately addressed. In this study, we investigate how certain team-level properties affect team members' development of knowledge networks through the course of a team project. Using data from 430 team leaders and team members pertaining to 145 software development projects, we test cross-level hypotheses using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). The results indicate that the team's perception of the organizational knowledge-sharing climate, the team's networking preference, and the team's perceived importance of networking for project success positively affect individuals' network building. Furthermore, a team's perception of the adequacy of its technical competency and a team's perception of the adequacy of its material resources inhibit team members' individual network development.

<p>Industrial countries moving from fixed to floating exchange rate regimes experience dramatic rises in the variability of the real exchange rate. This evidence, forcefully documented by Mussa [Nominal exchange regimes and the behavior of real exchange rates: evidence and implications. Camegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy 25 (1986) 117], is a puzzle because it is hard to reconcile with the assumption of flexible prices. This paper lays out a dynamic general equilibrium model of a small open economy that combines nominal price rigidity with a systematic behavior of monetary policy able to approximate a continuum of exchange rate regimes. A version of the model with complete exchange rate pass-through is broadly consistent with Mussa's findings. Most importantly, this holds independently of the underlying source of fluctuations in the economy, stressing the role of the nominal exchange rate regime per se in affecting the variability of the real exchange rate. However, only a model featuring incomplete exchange rate pass-through can account for a broader range of exchange rate statistics. Finally there exist ranges of values for either the degree of openness or the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods for which the baseline model is also consistent with the empirical insensitivity of output volatility to the type of exchange rate regime, as documented by Baxter and Stockman [Journal of Monetary Economics 23 (1989) 377].

<p>Monetary policy in the US is characterized by a substantial degree of inertia. While in principle this may well be the outcome of an optimizing central bank behaviour, the ability of any derived policy rule to match the data relies on so large weights for interest rate smoothing into policy makers' preferences as to be theoretically flawed. In this paper we investigate whether such a puzzle can be interpreted as resulting from the concern of monetary authorities for potential misspecifications of the macroeconomic dynamics. Accordingly, we propose a novel thick modelling approach that incorporates model uncertainty into the identification of central bank's preferences. The thick robust policy rule shows the kind of smoothness observed in the data without resorting to implausible values for the preference parameters.</p>"

<p>This paper studies the effects of employment protection legislation when job separation requires a mandatory advance notice or a firm's costly closure. In a tight labor market, firms use mandatory notice since job-to-job transitions reduce the expected firing costs. In a world without the lengthy procedure imposed by advance notice, job turnover is mainly accommodated by unemployment inflows. As notice length increases, the fraction of job turnover accounted for by job-to-job movements increases. These results are consistent with the fact that the North American and European markets, despite their difference in employment protection legislation, have different unemployment flows but similar job flows.</p>"

Data provide some support to our conjectures that high adjustment costs induce low flexibility and a focus on the long-term; and that a bad financial situation shifts the carries attention to short-term. Finally, the analysis of the composition of short- and long-term reaction provides some insights into the carriers' perspectives of the crisis duration. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>European regional support has grown in parallel with European integration. The funds targeted at achieving greater economic and social cohesion and reducing disparities within the European Union (EU) have more than doubled in relative terms since the end of the 1980s, making development policies the second most important policy area in the EU. The majority of the development funds have been earmarked for Objective 1 regions, i.e. regions where G D P per capita is below the 75% threshold of the E U average. However, the European development policies have come under increasing criticism based on two facts: the lack of upward mobility of assisted regions; and the absence of regional convergence. This paper assesses, using cross-sectional and panel data analyses, the failure so far of European development policies to fulfil their objective of delivering greater economic and social cohesion by examining how European Structural Fund support is allocated among different development axes in Objective 1 regions. We find that, despite the concentration of development funds on infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, on business support, the returns to commitments on these axes are not significant. Support to agriculture has short-term positive effects on growth, but these wane quickly, and only investment in education and human capital - which only represents about one-eight of the total commitments - has medium-term positive and significant returns.</p>"

<p>This paper proposes a quantitative analysis of social distance between Open Science and Proprietary Technology. A few general properties of social networks within both realms are discussed, as they emerge from the new economics of science and recent applied work on ""small worlds"". A new data-set on patent inventors is explored, in order to show that social networks within Proprietary Technology are much more fragmented than Open Science ones, except for science-based technologies. Two propositions are then put forward on the ""open"" behaviour expected from academic inventors, namely university scientists getting involved in Proprietary Technology networks by signing patents. Both propositions are confirmed by data, which show academic inventors to be more central and better connected than non-academic ones. The database and methodology produced for this paper are suggested to be relevant for the more general debate on the role of geographical and cognitive distance in university-industry technology transfer.

<p>We investigate organisational factors critical to the success of e-Banking (EB). Scholars report that a variety of factors are vital to EB success. A shortcoming in the extant EB literature is that much of the research focuses on a small subset of success factors and an overall ranking of factors is still missing. Our aim, therefore, is to synthesise and test the critical success factors (CSFs) identified in the existing literature, thus, substantiating or not the factors purported to be critical. To achieve our aim, we created a survey instrument from a synthesis of CSFs identified from existing EB and e-commerce literature. We draw upon the e-commerce body of knowledge to take in the widest set of CSFs that can affect EB. Data were collected from U. K.-based financial sector organisations that offer EB services. We found the most critical factors for success in EB are: quick responsive products/services, organisational flexibility, services expansion, systems integration and enhanced customer service. Our research shows that organisations need to manage their EB initiative at a strategic level and treat it as business critical rather than simply a technical or operational issue. They need to pay attention to internal integration, which includes channels, technology and business process integration, and improving the overall services to their customers.

<p>Recent years have seen the development of a growing literature, and corresponding managerial practices, about compensation measurement and management. On the other hand, there has also been the emergence of unexpected salary dynamics that seem to escape from any managerial control. The debate on salary dynamics is very much to the fore when it comes to the sport industry, especially football. This paper aims to analyse some of the determinants of Italian soccer players' salaries. In so doing, it analyses data collected from the 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 Serie A seasons, adopting a standard multiple regression model. Our findings show how the dynamics of players' salaries in the Serie A strongly fits with the non traditional pay plans (strongly with the pay-for-performance approach and partially with the skill-based one), while the traditional pay plan based on the job held by an individual seems not to fit.</p>"

Instead of looking for direct correlations between social and financial performance, we hypothesize that the first result of CSR activities is the creation of trust among the stakeholders. A survey conducted on consumers of organic products provided support for our hypothesis, showing that CSP influences consumer trust and that that trust in turn influences consumers' subsequent actions. The findings further suggest that intermediate variables between CSP and Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) may best support a business case for CSR.</p>"

<p>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is becoming a mainstream issue as both researchers and managers are realizing its importance, but knowledge gaps persist. In particular, the processes underlying the adoption of responsible managerial practices and the effects associated with them are still at the centre of intense debate. Not surprisingly, managers expect formalized procedures that might influence corporate managerial processes and especially corporate strategies. Given the growing emphasis on the integration of CSR into corporate strategy, the purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the antecedents of this process and the dynamics underlying it. We focus on a medium-sized, family-owned Italian company, SABAF SpA. We find that: the beliefs and value systems of entrepreneurs play a fundamental role in shaping a sustainable corporate strategy; the importance of the relationship between social performance and financial performance depends to some extent on the kind of competitive strategy that a company has selected; and people need to be aware of it - that is, CSR strategies must be explicit and codified into specific managerial procedures.</p>"

<p>The aim of this article is to contribute to understanding the changing role of government in promoting corporate social responsibility (CSR). Over the last decade, governments have joined other stakeholders in assuming a relevant role as drivers of CSR, working together with intergovernmental organizations and recognizing that public policies are key in encouraging a greater sense of CSR. This paper focuses on the analysis of the new strategies adopted by governments in order to promote, and encourage businesses to adopt, CSR values and strategies. The research is based on the analysis of an explanatory framework, related to the development of a relational analytical framework, which tries to analyze the vision, values, strategies and roles adopted by governments, and the integration of new partnerships that governments establish in the CSR area with the private sector and social organizations. The research compares CSR initiatives and public policies in three European countries: Italy, Norway and the United Kingdom, and focuses on governmental drivers and responses. The preliminary results demonstrate that governments are incorporating a common statement and discourse on CSR, working in partnership with the private and social sectors. For governments, CSR implies the need to manage a complex set of relationships in order to develop a win-win situation between business and social organizations. However, the research also focuses on the differences between the three governments when applying CSR public policies. These divergences are based on the previous cultural and political framework, such as the welfare state typology, the organizational structures and the business and social and cultural background in each country.</p>"

However, extant studies took into account just a single theoretical perspective lacking a more comprehensive overview of the factors, which may influence the intention to adopt a new communication technology. Since the growing interest of voice over IP (VoIP) we developed our theoretical framework and tested our hypotheses considering this emerging communication technology. Thus, the present research considers simultaneously the institutional, management fashion, and efficient-choice perspectives for understanding the drivers of VoIP adoption process. A theoretical model is developed and tested through structural equation modelling on 620 Italian firms. We hypothesize that both external and internal factors affect the intention to adopt VoIP. Results underscore both the importance of coercive and fashion setters' pressure (i.e. external factors), and the pivotal role of perceived internal benefits (i.e. internal factors) in shaping intention to adopt.</p>"

<p>Social entrepreneurship has emerged as an important research topic in the literature. This interest stems from social entrepreneurs' role in addressing serious social problems on a worldwide scale while enhancing social wealth, often without regard for profits.

We use the behavioral theory of the firm to distill key attributes of social opportunities and show how these attributes influence the timing and geographic scope of social ventures' international operations.

<p>In this article consequences of the introduction of competition for the field in the Italian natural gas distribution sector are analyzed.</p>
<p>Natural gas distribution constitutes, due to its technical and economic features, a natural monopoly. For this reason, in the framework of the liberalization process, the Italian legislator has introduced, in addition to price regulation, competitive tenders in order to have different operators compete amongst each other for the service concession.</p>
<p>After a brief overview of the economic theory referring to competition for the field and an overview of the Italian gas market, the critical aspects of the outlined regulatory framework will be highlighted. More particularly the main features of tenders will be assessed, while, in the following section, the meaning of the imposed revenue cap and its tie to the concession fee will be explained. An analysis of possible reasons for extremely high concession fees will be carried out, evaluating their possible impact on companies' profitability. In the last part of the work, a solution will be proposed in order to build an effective regulatory framework in which competition for the field could actually lead the market to efficiency.

<p>Previous studies suggest that there are strong differences in the rates of youth poverty across European countries. Rather surprisingly, it is found to be high in Scandinavian countries, and relatively speaking, lower in Mediterranean and Anglo-Saxon countries. This somewhat unexpected finding prompts the question whether the incidence of poverty is an appropriate measure of youth disadvantage. Instead of considering poverty rates we consider the length of recorded poverty spells, taking into account explicitly the temporal sequencing of the episodes of poverty. Using the European Community Household Panel, individuals are classified into different groups of poverty permanence, each reflecting severity of social disadvantage. Based on these categories we implement a generalized ordinal logit model to assess the various factors associated with social disadvantage among youth. We find that cross-national patterns differ from those found in previous studies. In particular from our findings it does not result that poverty is highest among young people in Social Democratic countries. Our analysis shows important gender differences, though they are not the same across the countries included in the study. For some countries it turns out that being a woman is a protective factor against long-term poverty. As previous studies suggests, young individuals' living arrangements matter.

<p>Almost all the literature on the evolution of the financial supervision architecture stresses the importance of financial market characteristics in determining the recent trend toward more unification. But in the real world it is not always clear to what extent market features matter. We present two complementary approaches to gain insights in the above relationship, focusing on the political cost and benefit analysis. First, a cross-country study tests two alternative theories-the helping hand and the grabbing hand view of government-to determine the impact of the market structure on the supervisory setting. Our evidence seems more consistent with the grabbing hand view, considering the degree of banking concentration a proxy of the capture risk and presuming the market demonstrates a preference for consolidation of supervisory powers. Second, the results of a survey among financial CEOs in Italy confirm a market preference for a more consolidated supervisory regime but reveal only weak consistency between the views of the policymakers and those of the market operators.

<p>In the Tourist-Caronte case in Italy, the incumbent, Tourist-Caronte, reacted to entry by entrant Diano by starting to supply a ""damaged good"" in the sense theorized by Deneckere and McAfee in 1996. We argue that in principle this strategy can be predatory, but it can also be an innocent response to entry. Specifically, the strategy of damaging the good leads to fiercer competition in the low segment of the market, which reduces the rents that the incumbent earns in the high segment, but may allow the incumbent to steal some of the entrant's rents. If this business stealing effect in the low segment of the market is sufficiently strong, the incumbent may find it profitable to expand its product line after entry, even if it does not have any predatory intent. We discuss the welfare effects of this strategy, and we contrast it with predation.</p>"

<p>There is a wide literature on the dynamic adjustment of employment and its relationship with the business cycle. In this paper we present a statistical model that offers a congruent representation of part of the UK labour market since the mid 1960s. We use a cointegrated vector autoregressive Markov-switching model in which some parameters change according to the phase of the business cycle. Output, employment, labour supply and real earnings are found to have a common cyclical component. The long run dynamics are characterized by one cointegrating vector relating unemployment to trend-adjusted real wages and output. Despite there having been many changes affecting this sector of the UK economy, the Markov-switching vector-equilibrium-correction model with three regimes (representing recession, normal growth, and high growth) provides a good characterization of the sample data, and performs well relative to alternative linear and non-linear models. The results of an impulse-response analysis highlight the dangers of using VARs when the constancy of the estimated coefficients has not been established, and demonstrate the advantages of generating regime dependent responses.</p>"

Data were gathered by online questionnaire from students enrolled in an Australian university. Involvement was found to be important to LMS success. Student involvement was shown to have a significant effect on the benefits to students of LMS use. The more involved a student is with the LMS site for a course offering, the stronger the benefits they report obtaining from use. On the other hand, student involvement did not have an effect on LMS use. Instructor involvement was found to guide appropriate use, both in terms of the nature of use and the extent of use.

<p>This paper presents a new perspective on the ambidexterity debate. Basing our work on the assumption that learning is a multilevel process, we develop and empirically test whether, how, and with what consequences firms can balance explorative and exploitative technology-learning activities across their organizational boundaries. Hypotheses are tested through a longitudinal panel of data tracking the cross-boundary learning strategies of 153 companies involved with innovation in the worldwide fuel cell industry over the period 1999-2006. By juxtaposing intra- and interorganizational exploration-exploitation, we find that the pursuit of cross-boundary ambidexterity is worthwhile. Firms that engage in internal exploitation tend to balance such learning orientation with explorative interorganizational agreements. Consistently, those firms engaged in external exploitation tend to balance it with an internal focus on exploration, at least in the case of exploitative alliances involving familiar partners. Moreover, results confirm that such complementary cross-boundary strategies improve a firm's innovative performance. European Management Review (2010) 7, 30-45. doi:10.1057/emr.2010.2</p>"

<p>Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mechanisms adopted by cities to control the provision of externalized public services and to explore the determinants of such control choices.</p>

<p>Findings - The results show that the control models found in the cases analyzed do not correspond to the ""pure"" patterns described in the private sector literature and that the factors identified by management control contributions do not seem to be exhaustive in explaining the configuration of control systems in the public sector. While environmental and task characteristics only partially explain the adoption of certain configurations of control, the features of the control systems seem to be rather influenced by variables that are related to party characteristics.</p>

<p>Purpose - The aim of this paper is to add to understanding of how cities function. Specifically, through the lens of power relationships in political organisations, it seeks to study the manner in which accounting and politics are involved in the development of city transport strategies.</p>

<p>Findings - The findings are on a number of levels. First, the study explains the efficacy of congestion charging systems. Second, in the politicised organisation of the city, the context in which policy makers sit is crucial in the elaboration of strategies. Third, the adoption of calculative practices such as congestion charging may reflect political rationality rather than actual need.</p>

<p>This paper discusses the issue of modularity from a problem-solving perspective. Modularity is in fact a decomposition heuristic, through which a complex problem is decomposed into independent or quasi-independent sub-problems. By means of a model of problem decomposition, this paper studies the trade-offs of modularity: on the one hand finer modules increase the speed of search, but on the other hand they usually determine lock-in into sub-optimal solutions. How to balance effectively this trade-off depends upon the problem environment and in particular on its complexity and volatility: we show that in stationary and complex environments there exists an evolutionary advantage to over-modularization, while in highly volatile environments, contrary to usual wisdom, modular search is inefficient in the long run. The empirical relevance of our findings is discussed especially with reference to the literature on systems integration.

<p>This paper employs data from an extensive European survey to produce one of the first systematic assessments of the private economic value of patents. The estimated mean of our patent value distribution is higher than 3 million euros, the median is about one-tenth of it, and the mode is around a few thousand euros. This is in line with previous findings about the skewed distribution of patent values. Our measure is significantly correlated with the number of patent citations, references, claims, and countries in which the patent is applied, Citations explain value as much as the other three indicators combined, and the right tail of citations is correlated with the right tail of our value measure. Yet, the four indicators only explain 2.7% of the variance of patent value. Thus, while the use of these indicators as proxies for value, particularly citations, may be justified, predictions based on these indicators carry significant noise. After using country, technology, and patent class fixed effects, we only explain 11.3% of the variation in patent value. The 'measure of our ignorance' about the determinants of patent value is then still sizable, which calls for additional research to fill the gap.

<p>Based on longitudinal data for a matched sample of 592 Italian academic inventors and controls, the paper explores the impact of patenting on university professors' scientific productivity, as measured by publication and citation counts. Academic inventors, that is, university professors who appear as designated inventors on at least one patent application, publish more and better quality papers than their non-patenting colleagues, and increase their productivity after patenting. Endogeneity problems are addressed by using instrumental variables and applying inverse probability of treatment weights. The beneficial effect of patenting on publication rates last longer for serial academic inventors. However, the positive effect of patenting on scientific productivity largely differs across scientific fields, being particularly strong only in pharmaceuticals and electronics.

<p>To date, the discussion regarding corporate social responsibility (CSR) has primarily addressed organizational rationale and activities. Little has been said about the individual characteristics and behaviors that promote the development of CSR within organizations. In this paper, we propose and test a model to explain individual differences in the propensity to engage in socially responsible behavior (SRB). By linking values, affect and reasoning to managers' propensity to 'do good' and 'do no harm,' we provide a more complete picture of how SRB arises in organizations. A survey of 643 middle managers in five multinational corporations supports our contention that values, affect and reasoning matter for SRB. In particular, self-transcendence values (universalism and benevolence) and positive affect increase the propensity to engage in SRB, as do moral and reputation-based reasoning styles. Moreover, we find that values and affect shape more controlled processes such as moral reasoning. We develop implications for the interaction between the individual and the organization in promoting SRB. European Management Review (2008) 5, 175-190. doi: 10.1057/emr.2008.15</p>"

<p>Existing conceptualizations of organization form in organization theory have led to viewing organizational change in two opposite ways: either it is assumed that organization cannot significantly change - and therefore change is driven predominantly by selection-based evolutionary processes - or it is assumed that organization can and should change altogether - as they shift from one form to another, due to complementarities among organizational elements and fit with context. This paper points out the limitations of these views (as well as of intermediate 'incremental change' views) based on the degree of change deemed to be possible and effective. The paper then outlines a more general model, overcoming those limitations, and conceptualizing change as a combination of organizational variants and invariants, intended as qualitatively different organizational elements. The increased predictive, explanatory, and prescriptive power of the proposed approach is illustrated using a longitudinal case study of organizational changes in Pilkington.

<p>We take a first look at financial patents at the European Patent Office (EPO). As is the case at the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the number of financial patents in Europe has increased significantly in parallel with significant changes in payment and financial systems. Scholars have argued that financial patents, like other business methods patents, have low value and are owned for strategic reasons rather than for protecting real inventions. We find that established firms in non-financial sectors with diversified patent portfolios own a large share of financial patents at the EPO. However, new specialized technology providers in the financial area also hold a number of such patents. Decisions on the financial patent applications take longer and they are more likely to be refused by the patent office, suggesting greater uncertainty over validity than for other patents. They are also more likely to be opposed, which is consistent with the fact that their other economic value indicators are higher.

What variables do firms have to consider in making decisions concerning the organization of co-design projects? Following a 'quasi-experimental' research design approach, we conducted a comparative study of two similar auto component co-development projects (air-conditioning systems) carried out by a Japanese first-tier supplier with two European automakers. Despite the coeteris paribus conditions defined by the research design, we observed significant cross-firm differences in task and knowledge partitioning and in the relationship governance. The study shows that firm-specific factors (e.g. pre-existing technological and organizational capabilities) not product architecture per se -resulted the key determinants of cross-firm differences. From this perspective our findings contributes to the broader debate about the co-determination of product architectures, firms' vertical scope and industry architecture.

<p>Bringing together research teams in up to 15 European countries, this project represents an ambitious attempt to analyse the impact of European integration on the corporate community. In particular, the research will investigate the Strategy-Structure-Ownership-Performance (SSOP) issues associated with the top 50 firms in each of those countries between 1957 and 2007, looking especially for any evidence of convergence towards a 'European' norm. A substantial database will be generated from this research, alongside a wide range of case studies that will enrich the quantitative evidence. This will provide the necessary information required for a reassessment of the views of Rugman, of Whittington and Mayer, and of Whitley, on the nature of international business activity.</p>"

<p>How does capital market access affect the capital structure decisions of firms? To examine this question, we compare the financing decisions of a large sample of private and public companies from 18 different European countries. We find significant differences in the leverage policies of private and public firms. Private firms have much higher leverage ratios than public firms. In particular, the leverage of private firms is more negatively related to past profitability, consistent with their less active adjustment. Other evidence corroborates sluggish adjustment and suggests that private firms face significantly higher cost of accessing external capital markets. When we compare private and public firms in countries that differ on creditor rights and contract enforceability, we find more pronounced differences in the leverage policies of private and public firms in countries that are strong on legal rights and their enforcement. In countries with weak rights and poor enforcement, the financing policies of public firms begin to resemble those of private firms.</p>"

<p>Is corruption systematically related to electoral rules? Recent theoretical work suggests a positive answer. But little is known about the data. We try to address this lacuna by relating corruption to different features of the electoral system in a sample of about eighty democracies in the 1990s. We exploit the cross-country variation in the data, as well as the time variation arising from recent episodes of electoral reform. The evidence is consistent with the theoretical priors. Larger voting districts-and thus lower barriers to entry-are associated with less corruption, whereas larger shares of candidates elected from party lists-and thus less individual accountability-are associated with more corruption. Individual accountability appears to be most strongly tied to personal ballots in plurality-rule elections, even though open party lists also seem to have some effect. Because different aspects roughly offset each other, a switch from strictly proportional to strictly majoritarian elections only has a small negative effect on corruption. (JEL: E62, H3)</p>"

<p>While there is consensus on the need to raise the time spent in the market by European women, it is not clear how these goals should be achieved. Tax wedges, assistance in the job search process, and part-time jobs are policy instruments that are widely debated in policy circles. The paper presents a simple model of labor supply with market frictions and heterogenous home production where the effects of these policies can be coherently analyzed. We show that subsidies to labor market entry increase women's entrance in the labor market, but they also increase exits from the labor market, with ambiguous effect on employment. Subsidies to part-time do increase employment, but they have ambiguous effects on hours and market production. Finally, reductions in taxes on market activities that are highly substitutable with home production have unambiguous positive effects on market employment and production. (JEL: J0, J2)</p>"

<p>Purpose - This paper aims at interpreting the epistemology of marketing. The paper investigates several research questions, proposing some initial reflections concerning their impact on marketing.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - The paper addresses the research questions by conducting an analysis of the marketing literature. An analysis of philosophical postmodern literature is also carried out. The paper's attempt constantly to create links between the level of philosophical elaboration and that of marketing research leads to a proposal of new approach to marketing research: experiential research.</p>
<p>Findings - In the paper's review of the marketing literature the traditional pragmatic approach of marketing as a discipline is highlighted. Its strong managerial perspective has partly diverted researchers' attention from the theory, and focused it mainly on the method. This has created an increasingly marked distinction between the marketing literature aimed at management, and that aimed at the academic community. The postmodern perspective on marketing calls for a rethinking of the ""scientific nature"" of marketing as an investigative field.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - The main point is that marketing cannot be a scientific discipline only by adopting a scientific method. Marketing research is by definition different in nature: it cannot generate better but only different knowledge. This perspective shift has an impact on all research components. First, the field of research widens enormously, because researchers can deal with everything arousing their interest and to which their accumulated knowledge can be applied. Since the discipline does not become scientific, the researcher can use any method. All methods can originate scientific theories, and therefore incremental knowledge. Hence science is neither objective nor absolute.</p>
<p>Originality/value - This paper analyses the philosophical roots of postmodernism, in order to understand its impact on postmodern marketing better. It also focuses on the impact of postmodernism on marketing research, and proposes a new approach. This paper then explores the features of the experiential research in marketing, and its effect on the processes of generating knowledge.</p>"

<p>Purpose - The aim of this paper is to investigate the characteristics of edutainment consumption and to analyze how new technologies influence it. It discusses a new theme, both with reference to the selected context (the phenomenon of edutainment itself and its consumption), and to the object itself (artistic consumption mediated by technological applications).</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - This paper addresses the research question previously mentioned by conducting an analysis of the marketing literature as it has been developed. The main areas of investigation are the experiential interpretation of consumer behaviour, entertainment and education. This paper is multidisciplinary in nature. An in-depth analysis of the main object of the research and an original model of analysis of cultural experience are provided.</p>
<p>Findings - The use of new technologies that stimulate all the senses of the individual allows the re-creation of the content of the message, both in terms of education and entertainment. A new form is given to the message, which is set in a new virtual environment, a ""virtual edutainment environment""(VEE), where the interaction with the customer takes place. In our review of the marketing literature analysis we highlight the reasons that give rise to the VEE as a particular kind of cyberspace. A VEE is an environment in which one or more consumers experience the re-created message. In this context, the usersmay interact amongst each other, but what is essential is that the information be elaborated in one complex way, utilizing multimedia tools in order to affect the consumer's senses. Hence, consumers are immersed in a deep experience of edutainment.</p>
<p>Practical implications - The convergence of education and entertainment, favoured by the diffusion of technology and its use, involves a very high risk for institutions that are trying to cling to their past history and their traditional managerial behaviour. Institutions like these need to use technological applications to increase the value of what they can offer to the consumer. For example, the learning process of the visitors of a museum will not be impaired by the entertaining use of new technologies. Instead, the memory of their experience will be reinforced and reinvigorated. The experiential interpretation of consumer behaviour has been one of the most innovative fields of study in the last 20 years, and it is even more promising for the future of marketing, as it is spreading into product categories that are far from being hedonistic.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The value of this paper is based on the proposal of an original model of analysis of cultural experience. The definition of the VEE takes its roots in other marketing concepts, such as the computer-mediated environment and cyberspace, but it differs from them since it highlights the particular features of a cultural experience mediated through technological applications. The same is true with re"

<p>While previous research has mostly focused on either knowledge stocks or knowledge flows, our study is among the first to integrate these perspectives in order to shed light on the complementarity effects of different types of knowledge stocks and flows in the multinational corporation (MNC). This study investigates intra-functional as well as cross-functional complementarity effects from the perspective of the knowledge recipient and tests their impact on the benefit created for MNC units. Based on a comprehensive sample of 324 relationships between MNC units, we find that both types of complementarity create benefits for these units, but that the effects from intra-functional combinations of knowledge stocks and flows are significantly stronger than from cross-functional combinations.

<p>This purpose of this article is to provide a framework into which we can integrate global strategy with stakeholder theory. Our aim is to create the basis for a research agenda that deals specifically with issues that are unique to global strategy and to use this perspective to demonstrate the insights that may arise for core stakeholder theory through the pursuit of such an agenda. We argue that a global perspective implies not only the management of stakeholders in various locations across the globe, but also the management of the rising phenomenon of multinationals and other organizations as truly global stakeholders. We argue that global stakeholder management involves a range of issues that are not yet fully considered either in the field of global strategy or the field of stakeholder theory. For example, drawing on recent research that emphasizes stakeholder claims as arising from rules of law, global strategy can involve selectively exposing the corporation across jurisdictions to particular stakeholders. This presents an opportunity for gains from the trade in intellectual ideas, concepts, theories, and empirical findings. Copyright (C) 2013 Strategic Management Society.</p>"

<p>The reform of the EU comitology system, enacted with Regulation 182/11, had the effect of extending the general principles regulating the Commission's exercise of implementing powers to the trade defence instruments' (TDIs) procedures, which, before the reform, were regulated by an autonomous discipline. This article offers an overview of the modifications brought about to TDI's comitology by Reg. 182/11 and identyies the possible consequences of the new discipline. The analysis benefited from the results of an empirical simulation, consisting in the application of the new voting methodology to past procedures of TDIs. The authors conclude, among the others, that the new system will likely reduce the usual political interferences in the Commission activities regarding TDIs, and it will settle a number of shortcomings of the old system.</p>"

<p>This paper extends Savage's subjective approach to probability and utility from decision problems under exogenous uncertainty to choice in strategic environments. Interactive uncertainty is modeled both explicitly, using hierarchies of preference relations, the analogue of beliefs hierarchies, and implicitly, using preference structures, the analogue of type spaces a la Harsanyi, and it is shown that the two approaches are equivalent. Preference structures can be seen as those sets of hierarchies arising when certain restrictions on preferences, along with the players' common certainty of the restrictions, are imposed. Preferences are a priori assumed to satisfy only very mild properties (reflexivity, transitivity, and monotone continuity). Thus, the results provide a framework for the analysis of behavior in games under essentially any axiomatic structure. An explicit characterization is given for Savage's axioms, and it is shown that a hierarchy of relatively simple preference relations uniquely identifies the decision maker's utilities and beliefs of all orders. Connections with the literature on beliefs hierarchies and correlated equilibria are discussed.</p>"

Unlike previous studies based on accounting or market performance measures we used a flexible ""data oriented"" approach, known as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), to evaluate the performance of a set of peer entities. We argue that the use of DEA is consistent with the rationale of benchmarking and, as such, with the theoretical foundations of agency framework, which is often evoked in studies on family business. Consistently with prevailing literature, we find evidence of higher profitability of family firms. However, advancing with respect to the existing literature, we reveal a systematic lower efficiency and a significant tendency to overuse labour and capital for family businesses.

<p>In the last two decades, the private sector has contracted a substantially larger share in the total amount of foreign-currency international debt (private sector share of external debt), especially in developing countries. In this paper, I empirically examine the effect of this phenomenon on bank loan prices. I find that the private sector share of external debt negatively and significantly impacts the price of bank loans. This result supports the hypothesis that private sector debt contributes to international financial stability to a greater degree than sovereign debt. Nevertheless, this impact is canceled out in the presence of fixed exchange regimes that are unsuitable with respect to fundamentals. In such circumstances, the private sector may take advantage of capital market distortions that are maintained by official authorities and thus exposes the country to further financial instability. Additional results corroborate the observation that the gain in financial stability stems from more efficient use of funds and reduced monitoring costs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>Background and study aims: THEBERA is a project funded by the European Union (EU), as an ERA-WIDE FP7 project, aiming to strengthen the Theodor Bilharz Research Institute (TBRI) capacities.</p>
<p>Materials and methods: A SWOT (strength/weakness/opportunities/threats) analysis of human, structural and organisational existing resources was performed in light of an extensive analysis of liver disease research and clinical management in Egypt, for a full understanding of TBRI needs.</p>
<p>Results: Strength and weakness features were identified and analysed, so were actions to be implemented and targets to be accomplished, to develop a business plan gathering the required critical mass (political, scientific, industrial, social) to select investment priorities, to sacrifice non-strategic areas of research, to promote national and international connections and industrial innovations, to update diagnostics and research device technologies and clinical management processes at European levels, to implement fundraising activities, to organise and properly assess training activities for young researchers, physicians, nurses, and technicians.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Research institute self assessment is a priority need for sustainable capacity building and for future build-up of a competent health care research institute. Sustainable capacity building strategies must be designed on needs assessment, involving salient requirements: clear strategy, leverage of administrative capacities, industrial support and connections, systematised training programmes and enhancement of mobility of health care staff implemented within ill-defined boundaries and continuously re-evaluated with multiple feedback loops in order to build a complex, adaptable and reliable system based on value.

While team research has emphasized the importance of team-internal processes for smaller scale projects, we know little about collaborative processes (especially between teams) in such large-scale projects. This study utilizes a multi-informant longitudinal research design on a product development project (39 teams, 36 months) in the European automotive industry investigating collaboration between and within teams. The results of the study demonstrate that interteam coordination, project commitment, and teamwork quality as rated by the team members at Time 1 (Month 12; end of concept phase) are significantly correlated to project managers' ratings of overall team performance at Time 3 (Month 36; end of project). The process variables measured at Time 2 (Month 24; end of design phase) display generally weaker correlations with team performance at Time 3. Multiple regression analyses further detail the effects of collaborative processes within and between teams on different measures of team performance (i.e., overall performance, quality, budget, schedule). The results show that collaborative processes during the project have predictive properties in regard to later team performance and can serve as early warning indicators. Furthermore, the results of this study provide support for our hypotheses predicting positive relationships between interteam coordination, project commitment, and teamwork quality. Theoretical and practical implications of this study are discussed.</p>"

<p>An analysis of 4,814 SEOs during 1986-1999 indicates that the average offering of new shares is priced at a discount of 3% from the closing price on the day before the issue. Discounts have risen steadily over time, sharply increasing the indirect costs of issuing seasoned equity. There is evidence of increased clustering of offer prices at integers, and of greater importance in the analyst coverage provided by underwriters. Adjusting for other factors, we find that issues with integer offer prices, and underwriters with highly regarded analysts, are increasingly associated with larger discounts. The rise in discounts is consistent with an increased ability of investment bankers to extract rents from issuing firms.</p>"

<p>A widely held concern in library and information science (LIS) is that the relationship between research and practice, and particularly the communication of research to practice, is flawed. Through critical analysis of the literature, the authors examine the nature of the gap between research and practice, strategies to reduce the gap, and research on the effectiveness of the strategies. Eleven types of gap are identified: knowledge, culture, motivation, relevance, immediacy, publication, reading, terminology, activity, education, and temporal. Strategies proposed in the literature emphasize ways to increase practitioner research activity and to close the publications gap. Only one of the proposed strategies, inclusion of research reports in practitioner publications, is supported by research. The authors propose further research to evaluate this and other strategies based on recognition of a wider range of channels for communication of research to practice and the role of intermediaries between researchers and practitioners.

Starting from the limitations of the definition of uncertainty, especially when applied to contexts characterised by knowledge intensity, this study investigates the relationship between knowledge complexity and management control systems. This relationship is analysed in the realm of knowledge-intensive firms' teams where it is particularly critical due to the double coordination and knowledge integration role played by management control systems. A field research conducted in three project teams of a software firm supports the relevance of knowledge complexity in explaining the variation of management control systems.

Their results, based on an analysis of 13,720 price quotes, show that when posted prices are considered, traditional retailers have the highest prices, followed by multichannel retailers, and pure-play e-tailers, in that order However when shipping costs are included, multichannel retailers have the highest prices, followed by pure-play e-tailers and traditional retailers, in that order With regard to price dispersion, pure-play e-tailers have the highest range of prices, but the lowest standard deviation.

<p>What is the future of social security systems in OECD countries? We suggest that the answer belongs to the realm of politics, and evaluate how political constraints and ageing shape the social security system. The increasing ratio of retirees to workers lowers the rate of returns of unfunded pay-as-you-go social security, and induces citizens to prefer smaller such systems and a larger role for private savings. An ageing electorate, however, increases the relevance of pension spending on the agenda of office-seeking policy-makers and tends to increase the size of unfunded pension systems. Calibrating the strength of these effects for France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK and the US, we find that the latter political aspect always outweighs the former. The relative size of the effects depends on country-specific characteristics and modelling details: when labour market distortions are accounted for the political effect still dominates but becomes less sizeable; the different redistributive character of pension systems and the strength of family ties also play a role in determining politico-economic outcomes. A higher effective retirement age always decreases the size of the system chosen by the voters, often increases its generosity, and may be the only viable solution to pension system problems in the face of population ageing.</p>"

<p>Consumer-centered product design is an emerging best practice in many industries, particularly those characterized by practical products that hold no emotional appeal; or in which competition is based on increasingly less profitable attempts to cut cost or improve performance; or in which once distinctive products are becoming commoditized; or in which there is little room left for product innovation. Among the best practitioners, design is understood to be a core activity conferring competitive advantage by bringing to light the emotional meaning products and services have, or could have, for consumers and extracting the high value of such emotional connections. The authors discuss how companies such as Master Lock, Procter & Gamble, BMW and Cambridge SoundWorks have employed design research - including the use of multidisciplinary teams and a variety of ethnographic and psychophysiological techniques - to build organizationwide identification with the customers' needs and aspirations, keeping everyone's eyes on the same prize.</p>"

<p>After the creation of the European Monetary Union (EMU), both the European Commission (EC) and the European Central Bank (ECB) are focusing more and more on the evolution of the EMU as a whole, rather than on single member countries. A particularly relevant issue from a policy point of view is the availability of reliable forecasts for the key macroeconomic variables. Hence, both the fiscal and the monetary authorities have developed aggregate forecasting models, along the lines previously adopted for the analysis of single countries. A similar approach will be likely followed in empirical analyses on, e.g., the existence of an aggregate Taylor rule or the evaluation of the aggregate impact of monetary policy shocks, where linear specifications are usually adopted. Yet, it is uncertain whether standard linear models provide the proper statistical framework to address these issues. The process of aggregation across countries can produce smoother series, better suited for the analysis with linear models, by averaging out country specific shocks. But the method of construction of the aggregate series, which often involves time-varying weights, and the presence of common shocks across the countries, such as the deflation in the early 1980s and the convergence process in the early 1990s, can introduce substantial non-linearity into the generating process of the aggregate series. To evaluate whether this is the case, we fit a variety of non-linear and time-varying models to aggregate EMU macroeconomic variables, and compare them with linear specifications. Since non-linear models often over-fit in sample, we assess their performance in a real time forecasting framework. It turns out that for several variables linear models are beaten by non-linear specifications, a result that questions the use of standard linear methods for forecasting and modeling EMU variables.

<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the role of genes and environment in susceptibility to breast cancer and to give an estimate of heritability in the propensity to develop the disease. To do this we applied an interdisciplinary approach, merging models developed in the field of demography and survival analysis - so-called frailty models - and models coming from quantitative genetics and epidemiology, namely genetic models. In our study, the inferential problem was solved in a Bayesian framework and the numerical work was carried out using MCMC methods. We used the special information coming from twin data, particularly breast cancer data, from the Swedish Twin Register. The application of a correlated log-normal frailty model leads to a very large estimate of the population heterogeneity (sigma=6.7), and relatively small correlations between co-twins' frailties - around 0.3 for monozygotic and 0.1 for dizygotic twins. Comparing three different genetic models (an ACE, an AE and an AIDE model), we furthermore concluded that genetic effects would explain globally almost 30% of the total variability of propensity to breast cancer. Environmental effects would be predominant in determining breast cancer susceptibility and these effects would be primarily individual-specific, that is, non-shared effects. Finally, a model which includes dominance genetic effects (ADE model) is preferred for genetic and statistical reasons.</p>"

A conjugate prior can thus be regarded as maximally informative in the sense that it minimizes the weight of the observations on inferences about the parameter; in other words, the expected relative entropy between prior and posterior is minimized when a conjugate prior is used.</p>"

<p>We used data from a multicentre case-control study conducted in Italy between 1991 and 1994 on over 2500 cases of breast cancer and a comparable number of controls, and estimates of breast cancer incidence in Italy to compute individual breast cancer risk for Italian women. The estimated probabilities between age 50 and 80 ranged from approximately 5% (for a woman with no family history and low modifiable risk profile) to about 30% (for a woman with young family history and high modifiable risk) on the basis of various women's baseline characteristics. Expected numbers of breast cancer cases using the present model were compared with those based on the USA Gail model, and with the observed ones in the comparison group of the Italian Tamoxifen Trial. These show a closer agreement between the observed and the expected total numbers of breast cancers than the USA Gail model. Thus, the Gail model can be improved for use in other populations by using estimates of incidence and risk which are more appropriate to the target population.

A two-region dynamic model is developed, which accounts for the skill composition of recent internal migration flows; it also innovates on the existing literature on migration by introducing capital-skill complementarity in the production function. The main conclusion is that migration can actually aggravate labor market imbalances. In a competitive set-up, migration temporarily amplifies the geographical dispersion of unskilled workers' wages and raises the average wage premium of the economy. When wage rigidities are introduced, labor mobility increases regional dispersion of unskilled workers' employment. In the short-run it may even reduce the total employment of the economy.</p>"

Although poor economies grow faster than rich economies during the transition to the steady state, the former do not catch up with the income per capita levels of the latter.

<p>In this paper we conduct descriptive aggregate analyses to revisit the relationship of low and lowest-low period fertility to cohort fertility and key fertility-related behaviour such as leaving the parental home, marriage, and women's labour force participation. Our analyses show that the cross-country correlations in Europe between total fertility and the total first marriage rate, the proportion of extramarital births, and the labour force participation of women reversed during the period from 1975 to 1999. By the end of the 1990s there was also no longer evidence that divorce levels were negatively associated with fertility levels. We argue that lowest-low fertility has been particularly associated with a 'falling behind' of cohort fertility at higher birth orders and later ages. From these analyses we conclude that the emergence of lowest-low fertility during the 1990s was accompanied by a disruption or even a reversal of many well-known relationships that have been used to explain cross-country differences in fertility patterns.</p>"

<p>Aim. Increasing ageing of the population and tumor incidence, along with worldwide rationing of the resources for public health systems, spur the use of economic analyses for the choice of strategies and technologies in the assessment and management of cancer patients. Incidence and clinical managing of tumors vary in different countries even if positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) is becoming a routine clinical method for diagnosis, staging, treatment monitoring and follow-up in a variety of tumors. Available data indicate that PET can he considered a superior alternative or complementary tool to other well-established methods. However, in spite of the above and of the rapidly increasing number of PET centers in Europe, USA and Japan, only a few studies have dealt with some of the economic aspects raised by the clinical use of PET because of differences in values of reimbursements and health costs. The main aim of this study is to propose and discuss an economic model of analysis for PET applications in the field of detection and management of pulmonary tumors.</p>
<p>Methods. In this study 2 assessments were performed by decision tree analysis on the economic impact of the availability of PET on decision-making processes for 2 conditions: solitary pulmonary nodules assessment and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) staging. In order to define a methodology consistent with the system of reimbursement and the prevalent clinical views of the Italian National Health Service, data on costs, death probability, and life expectancy were gathered from the literature and from the Italian system of reimbursement (ROD-DRGs).</p>
<p>Results. The results of the cost minimization analysis demonstrate that the use of PET in the diagnostic path for the workup of patients with SPN reduces the overall diagnostic costs, by approximately 50 Euro per patient, by reducing inappropriate invasive diagnostic investigation and their complications. The results of the cost effectiveness analysis demonstrate that the use of PET in the diagnostic path for the staging of patients with NSCLC reduces the overall diagnostic costs by approximately 108 Euro, for added year, by reducing inappropriate surgical interventions and their complications.</p>
<p>Conclusion. Both analyses are based on standard methods used in the literature, so our conclusions can be compared with results and assessments of similar studies in different countries and health care systems. Also in the Italian case, the use of an economic assessment provides relevant informal ion on the efficacy and effectiveness of PET.</p>"

<p>Recent geographical migration studies have aimed at clarifying the impact of both social environment and people's desires and beliefs on migration behaviour. However, most studies have focused on migration in Western countries, using cross-sectional data and single level methods. In this paper, we study the determinants of internal migration in Estonia, a multicultural society., during the transition period (1989-94). We use longitudinal data and apply multilevel event history methods. We show that both personal and contextual (potentially time-varying) factors are important in determining migration propensity. Moreover, several personal determinants - age, employment status, ethnic origin - interact with environmental conditions in shaping behaviour. While our results of the age differences support a traditional life-course-related migration pattern, our results of the differences in migration behaviour by employment status and ethnic origin imply deepening social polarization and ethnic segregation in post-Soviet Estonia as a result of internal migration.</p>"

<p>Consider a (possibly infinite) exchangeable sequence X = {X-n : 1 less than or equal to n < N}, where N is an element of N boolean OR {infinity}, with values in a Borel space (A, A), and note X-n = (X-1,..., X-n). We say that X is Hoeffding decomposable if, for each n, every square integrable, centered and symmetric statistic based on Xn can be written as an orthogonal sum of n U-statistics with degenerated and symmetric kernels of increasing order. The only two examples of Hoeffding decomposable sequences studied in the literature are i.i.d. random variables and extractions without replacement from a finite population. In the first part of the paper we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for an exchangeable sequence to be Hoeffding decomposable, that is, called weak independence. We show that not every exchangeable sequence is weakly independent, and, therefore, that not every exchangeable sequence is Hoeffding decomposable. In the second part we apply our results to a class of exchangeable and weakly independent random vectors X-n((alpha,c)) = (X-1((alpha,c)),..., X-n((alpha,c))) whose law is characterized by a positive and finite measure alpha((.)) on A and by a real constant c. For instance, if c = 0, X-n((alpha,c)) is a vector of i.i.d. random variables with law alpha((.))/alpha(A); if A is finite, alpha((.)) is integer valued and c = -1, X-n((alpha,c)) represents the first n extractions without replacement from a finite population; if c > 0, X-n((alpha,c)) consists of the first n n instants of a generalized Polya urn sequence. For every choice of alpha((.)) and c, the Hoeffding-ANOVA decomposition of a symmetric and square integrable statistic T(X-n((alpha,c))) is explicitly computed in terms of linear combinations of well chosen conditional expectations of T. Our formulae generalize and unify the classic results of Hoeffding [Ann. Math. Statist. 19 (1948) 293-325] for i.i.d. variables, Zhao and Chen [Acta Math. Appl. Sinica 6 (1990) 263-272] and Bloznelis and Gotze [Ann. Statist. 29 (2001) 353-365 and Ann. Probab. 30 (2002) 1238-1265] for finite population statistics.

<p>Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oxaprozin in comparison with diclofenac in patients with periarthritis pain of the shoulder previously unsuccessfully treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs other than diclofenac and oxaprozin.</p>
<p>Methods: In this open, multicentre, randomised, controlled study, eligible patients with periarthritis of the shoulder were randomised to receive either oxaprozin 1200 mg once daily (n = 49) or diclofenac 50 mg three times daily (n = 47). The treatment period was 15 +/- 1 days. The study was planned on a hypothesis of equivalence between the two study drugs. The primary study endpoint was the change from baseline at day 15 in the patient-assessed shoulder pain Score. Secondary efficacy variables included investigator-assessed shoulder function, patient-assessed quality of life on the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) Acute Health Survey and both patients' and investigators' overall assessment of efficacy.</p>
<p>Results: At day 15, the mean changes in shoulder pain score from baseline in the oxaprozin and diclofenac groups were -5.85 +/- SD 4.62 and -5.54 +/- SD 4.41, respectively. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant, confirming the hypothesis of the study that oxaprozin is as effective as diclofenac. Investigator-assessed shoulder function improved in both groups but more so in the oxaprozin group (p = 0.028 at day 15). Quality of life as measured by SF-36 total score was also improved in both treatment groups, with a trend toward greater improvement in the oxaprozin group. Furthermore, a significantly more favourable effect on the SF-36 'mental health' item was observed in oxaprozin compared with diclofenac-treated patients at day 15 (p = 0.0202). As assessed by investigators, the overall efficacy of oxaprozin was superior to that for diclofenac at visit 3 (8 +/- 1 days) (p = 0.0067). Patients also assessed the overall efficacy of oxaprozin as superior to that of diclofenac at visits 3 (8 +/- 1 days) (p = 0.0235) and 4 (15 +/- 1 days) (p = 0.0272). Only six adverse events, all of which were mild or moderate in intensity and occurred in four diclofenac recipients, were observed in the study.</p>
<p>Conclusions:As expected, once-daily oxaprozin proved to be as effective as diclofenac three times daily in reducing the primary efficacy variable of patient-assessed shoulder pain score in patients with periarthritis of the shoulder refractory to previous treatments with other NSAIDs. Oxaprozin was shown to be superior to diclofenac in improving shoulder function and was considered by investigators and patients to have greater overall efficacy than diclofenac. In addition, oxaprozin showed a trend toward superior results in improving patients' quality of life compared with diclofenac. A trend towards better tolerability results for oxaprozin compared with diclofenac was also noted.</p>"

<p>The paper provides a contribution to the recent debate about targets and effectiveness of network policies at the EU level, by presenting an analysis of the R&D network that has emerged over Framework Programmes. Social network analysis is employed to describe structural properties and dynamics of the emerging network, which appears to be dense and pervasive, branching around a large 'oligarchic core', whose centrality and connectivity strengthened over programmes. The paper discusses the degree to which this network structure may respond to EU broad policy objectives and its implications for recent programmes aimed at shaping a European Research Area. Attention is placed on the late focus by European institutions on networking centres of excellence. Since future initiatives are to build on the existing fabric, we argue that understanding how networks formed and evolved following previous stimuli is of great relevance for implementing and assessing the impact of the newly defined network approach.</p>"

Under regionalization, each of Italy's 21 regional governments is able to design its own funding arrangements. The regions have generally been trying to mitigate the effects of quasi-markets and are now increasingly 'governing' them. The system is producing some desirable results, including a shift from ordinary to same-day hospitalizations and a reduction in length of stay.

We introduce a relation derived from the DM's preferences, called ""unambiguous preference"", and show that it can be represented by a set of probabilities. We provide such set with a simple differential characterization, and argue that it is a behavioral representation of the ""ambiguity"" that the DM may perceive. Given such revealed ambiguity, we provide a representation of ambiguity attitudes. We also characterize axiomatically a special case of our decision model, the ""alpha-maxmin"" expected utility model. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

In particular, we generalize the evaluation formula for American call options due to Whaley [Journal of Financial Economics 9 (1981) 207], allowing for a stochastic jump of the underlying security at the ex-dividend date and discuss the existence of the optimal stopping time. In the same framework, we analyze American put options, justifying the procedure used in Meyer [Journal of Computational Finance 5 (2) (2002)] to account for the presence of discrete dividends in the free boundary formulation from the perspective of optimal stopping theory.

This paper provides a review of the recent reform and offers some tentative answers to the issues still open, relying on a series of simulations and projections. A number of conclusions have been reached. First, when the long-run performance of the new financing systems is investigated, regional resources may no longer be adequate to meet future health needs. Second, the incentives for active tax policies seem either to prove too weak or even to cause undesirable results. Finally, the complete devolution to the Regions of some significant public expenditure functions risks strengthening the polarisation of financial flows between the Northern and Southern Regions in the long run.</p>"

Chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, become a lifelong health problem for the individual, the family, and in the workplace. Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent diabetes and no cure for diabetes once acquired.

The DQIP measures are noteworthy as a model for many other chronic diseases. Indeed, the DQIP represents the first widely adopted comprehensive performance measurement standards, not just for diabetes but for any single chronic disease.

<p>The theory and research on chief executive officer (CEO) compensation tends to be dominated by assumptions and values reflective of those dominant in the national culture of the United States, where most of this work is done.

This study seeks to expand the understanding of CEO compensation by examining it in the context of other cultures, based on the premise that national culture plays a significant part in the nature of compensation strategies.</p>
<p>We relate cultural dimensions (uncertainty avoidance, power distance, individualism, and masculinity-femininity) developed by Hofstede (Hofstede 1980a, 2001) to several dimensions of CEO compensation. These dimensions are total CEO pay, the proportion of variable pay to total compensation, and the ratio of CEO pay to the lowest level employees. The main findings of our paper are (1) all of the different dimensions of CEO pay were related to power distance, leading us to infer that CEO pay in a culture is most reflective of the strength of the power structure in a society, and (2) total compensation and the ratio of variable pay to total pay are related to individualism.</p>
<p>We conclude that cultural dimensions can contribute to understanding cross-national CEO compensation. The implication of this conclusion is that there are different ways that CEO compensation fits into the cognitive schema of various cultures and, furthermore, that these cognitive schema vary across societies that affect the nature of the ""cultural matrix into which [money] is incorporated"" (Bloch and Parry 1989, p. 1). Moreover, our results imply that particular forms of CEO compensation do not mean the same thing in different cultures, but rather carry different symbolic connotations depending on the values dominant in a society. Thus, not only does the compensation structure of a firm within a culture have a symbolic meaning within organizations (e.g., Trice and Beyer 1993), but it can also be seen as an expression of deeper social values (Hofstede et al. 1990) that may differ across countries.</p>"

<p>In popular parlance, Necessity is the Mother of Invention. Entrepreneurs invent around resource constraints and, when they have to be, problems get solved. Yet in many walks of life, including management, such catalytic constraints are predominantly seen as negative - obstacles rather than opportunities for innovation. Inadequate resourcing is often cited as a reason for the lack of innovation in large companies, for example, when such fiscal conservatism could just as well form an opportunity for entrepreneurship. This introduction to the special issue attempts to reconcile the dual nature of boundaries. It develops five types of boundaries that can serve as an aid to innovation and discusses how we can be more intentional in the usage of these boundaries. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>Background</p>
<p>Rheumatic diseases have an economic impact of 1-2.5% of GDP in industrialized countries and osteoarthritis is the most common joint disorder Osteoarthritis of the knee is especially common and is a major cause of disability requiring extensive utilization of health care resources.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>To estimate the burden of osteoarthritis of the knee in Italy, we studied retrospectively a cohort of 254 patients over a period of 12 months in 2000-2001.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Twenty-nine rheumatology institutes took part in the study. A bottom-up approach was used, analytically measuring pro capita consumption. We considered medical (hospitalization, diagnosis, and therapies) and non-medical costs (transport, temporary caregivers, and auxiliary devices) as direct costs. We calculated losses of productivity borne by patients and caregivers, and informal care provided by caregivers as indirect costs.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Direct costs came to E 934 per patient per year: E 233 were spent on hospitalization, E 209 on diagnostic procedures (56% on visits and 44% on instrumental and laboratory tests), E 146 on therapy (58% on physiotherapy and 42% on drugs), and E 346 on non-medical costs (73% on salaries to temporary caregivers, 14% on transport, and 13% on auxiliary devices). It is interesting to point out that at least 37% of costs were charged directly to patients. Indirect costs were almost 30% higher and came to E 1236 per patient per year: 31% was due to loss of productivity of patients, 60% due to informal care provided by primary caregivers, and 9% by other caregivers.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>This study confirms that the direct and indirect costs attributable to osteoarthritis of the knee are substantial.</p>"

<p>Economists often operate under an implicit assumption that the tastes of a decision maker are quite stable, while his beliefs change with the availability of new information. We show that for a general class of preferences, a separation of a key component of tastes, the utility function, from the other components of the representation is possible only if the decision maker's preferences satisfy a mild but not completely innocuous condition, called 'certainty independence'. We also outline the axiomatic characterization of the preferences that obtain such separation, which are a subset of the biseparable preferences. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>In a context of limited resources and continuous increase of healthcare expenditures, policy makers need to carefully evaluate the economic impact of their decisions. In the last decade economists have been particularly productive in offering to the decision makers a set of tools able to compare costs and benefits of each single medical procedure. The underlying assumption is that it is not acceptable the investment of considerable amounts of resources in medical procedures able to guarantee only limited improvements in health outcomes.</p>
<p>In this particular type of context, an open issue is represented by the delicate topic of the provision of prolonged life sustaining treatments (PLST) to patients in vegetative state. The author, sustains that the provision of this type of treatments can be justified under a mere economic perspective. The traditional economic evaluations focus their attention only to the concept of incremental absorption of resources failing to capture other relevant dimensions: total costs and budget impact. The overall cost related to PLST due to the relative low unit cost and the low prevalence of patients in need of these treatments, represents a negligible part of the total health care budget. Hence, the emphasis on costs, in this circumstance, is misleading, especially considering that the current health care systems in the developed countries are characterized by wastes and inefficiencies that unduly increase costs. In addition, PLST provide a high return in terms of new knowledge, giving valuable insight on the clinical management of other severe health conditions. Long term therapies can also be considered a highly effective learning environment for health professionals. Finally, prolonged life therapies and treatments can also be considered an environment for experimenting ""creative"" solutions and approaches.</p>"

<p>The centrality of firms vis-a-vis regions underlines a general contrast between two models of producing innovations. This paper uses a new database composed of 4262 European chemical patents applied by 693 firms during 1987-1996 to compare the relative effect of firm and regional characteristics on the production of technological ""hits"" (highly cited patents). By using extensive controls, the main finding of the paper is that technological hits in the ""traditional"" chemical sectors are explained only by R&D intensity at the firm level and the scale of the research projects. Firm competencies, particularly technological specialisation, are still important in biotechnology. However, the distinct feature of the biotechnology model is that localised knowledge spillovers also matter. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This article explains how embodied cognition and perceptual symbol systems enable product designers to influence consumers by communicating key perceptual features through subtle changes in product design elements. In this way, managers can change perceptual design elements to support line extension strategies. More specifically, design changes can be used as a tool to help evolve consumer perceptions of a product's uses and brand category membership. The role of perceptual symbols in product design is illustrated by a well-known off-road motorbike brand that planned to extend into the street motorbike segment. In order to facilitate consumer acceptance of a street motorbike from this off-road brand, the firm gradually introduced models containing an increasing number of elements of street motorbikes over a period of several years. The authors use this example to show how typical design elements of the target product category can be effectively integrated with design elements of the current product category by simply modifying key characteristics of product-shape attributes. This process is further tested in an experiment, where motorbike models differing slightly in key product features (e.g., product shape) were rated on their resemblance to street or off-road motorbikes. The results show a strong effect of these design changes on brand-category membership. Managerial implications of this approach and future research directions are discussed.</p>"

We identify the common role of middle managers in the three countries as the responsibility to both maintain a positive social environment and to handle exceptions and solve unexpected problems. German and Italian managers are directly involved in the solution of technical problems, while their British counterparts act as brokers of technical specialized competences.

<p>HR portals are complex information technology (IT) applications that can be accessed by all employees of a given organization. By placing more applications and information online, HR portals reduce the reliance employees have on HR personnel.

By integrating change management theories with IT user acceptance models, this article adds to HR's collective knowledge Of ways to effectively implement HR portals. In addition, this article describes the cross-national challenges that exist when a global firm attempts to implement an HR portal around the world. Thus, this article will present a model that (1) integrates change management theories and IT user acceptance models and (2) illustrates the ways in which change management plans may need to be adapted to be effective in various subsidiaries.

<p>Many B2B exchanges have failed in recent years, while a few operators survived the hype and reached the break-even point. Since the operators in these exchanges are business service providers, their survival is linked to the value they render to user firms (just as for any other intermediate service activity), while potential participants will join the exchange only if this choice may improve their competitiveness and increase value. This article proposes a different perspective to discuss the role of these exchanges, in which the competitive impact provided becomes the main driver for participant firms-and the main driver for the success of exchanges. A survey of B2B exchanges shows that participating firms can extract value from internal activity management and from inter-organizational network participation, which improves efficiency and exploits partnership opportunities. Specific resources support these drivers of value creation with different competitive features. For firms, participation in B2B exchanges should become a deliberate long-term strategy to sustain their competitive positions. B2B operators need to address their business models to the competitive needs of potential users.</p>"

<p>This research investigated how the ownership structure is related to the firm's overall compensation strategy. The findings extend previous research that focused primarily on CEO compensation strategy. We show that there are significant differences in the compensation practices that apply to all employees as a function of the ownership structure. The results show that for owner-controlled firms and owner-managed firms there is significant pay/performance sensitivity for all employees. In management-controlled firms, changes in pay are related to changes in size of the firm. These findings lead us to conclude that ownership structure not only affects upper management's pay, but also the pay of all employees through substantial differences in the firm's compensation practices.

The Taylor rule is also slightly more robust to uncertainty about the exchange rate model than are rules that respond to the rate of exchange rate depreciation. Our results thus indicate that the Taylor rule is sufficient to stabilize a small open economy, also under exchange rate model uncertainty. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>The authors' research suggests that a variety of traps that forestall innovation can be avoided by, paradoxically, placing boundaries on innovation activity. In an environment without boundaries, say the authors, there is no context for shared interpretation or common expectations. Boundaries, on the other hand, act not as constraints but as aids to defining innovation needs and producing useful outputs that business units can exploit. Smartly placed constraints actually act as enablers of innovation by making it more palatable and execution friendly and giving it traction in the competition for corporate attention and resources.</p>
<p>Drawing on their research, the authors offer several scenarios of ""boundaries in use "" They describe how Shell makes the radical legitimate by making it thematically relevant to core business, how Nokia restricts its innovation efforts to business-unit strategies and environmental turbulence, how Air Products focuses on ideas that leverage operational capabilities, how Siemens focuses on innovation potential that crosses products and businesses, and how IDEO's work with Texas Health Resources reframes the customer experience to anchor solutions in new ways.</p>"

<p>This paper explores ongoing debates about the role that codified forms of knowledge play in fostering innovative behaviour. It aims to provide an empirical exploration of the use of codified sources of information for innovation at the firm and sectoral level. Despite considerable interest in David and Foray's (1995) work on the codification of knowledge and the changing nature of innovation due to the use of information and communication technologies, there are relatively few empirical studies that probe the role of codified sources of information in the innovation process. Our goal is to assess how important codified sources of information are for innovation among different firms and sectors. We find that use of codified sources of knowledge is highly concentrated in high technology sectors and among firms with existing absorptive capacity. The analysis shows that the use of other sources of information for innovation is a strong predictor of a firms use of codified sources. The data used for the analysis is based on The Netherlands Community Innovation Survey (II) for the manufacturing sector and covers over 2001 firms in 11 industries.</p>"

<p>This paper focuses on nine large developing countries. Structural decomposition analysis shows that they tend to concentrate innovative activities in industries stagnating at the world level; international trends partly offset national improvements in patent shares. The same occurs for world export shares, although countries display greater adaptation to world demand. Econometric analysis suggests that technological activity is related to export gains in high technology sectors if a country expands in industries with increasing technological opportunities, in medium technology sectors if it moves away from low opportunity sectors, in low technology sectors if it is initially specialized in growing sectors. In high-tech and low-tech sectors, export performance is also affected by the growth of technical capabilities, foreign direct investments, productivity, and the initial level of technical skills and in medium tech by the growth rates of foreign direct investments.

<p>Purpose - To investigate the theoretical foundations of price as a multi-dimensional component of value and to examine the nature of the relationship between price-attribute perception and overall price evaluation.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - The economic theory of the distribution of surplus across customers and the equity theory are used to develop the hypotheses about the multi-dimensional nature of the price construct. Prospect theory is used to predict the relationship between price-attribute performance and overall price evaluation. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire regarding mobile communications operators in Italy. After carrying out a principal factor analysis, several regression models were run to test the hypotheses.</p>
<p>Findings - The results confirm that price is a multi-dimensional construct (i.e. made up of cheapness, fairness and variety), yet they do not fully support the prospect theory predictions.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - Multi-item price measurement scales need to be further developed and validated. The theoretical framework needs to be further validated in other industries to assess the external validity of these findings.</p>
<p>Practical implications - Different dimensions of price represent different ""evaluation categories"", all related to importance, yet vastly different in how one ought to respond to each of them. For price dimensions showing an asymmetric relationship with overall price evaluation, relative importance is a function of performance.</p>
<p>Originality/value - This paper extends the price conceptualization from a uni-dimensional to a multi-dimensional construct and suggests an integration of prospect theory. It offers a contribution for research on evaluation measurement procedures as well as on price and value management.</p>"

In addition to estimating the impact of individuals' socioeconomic background and of their subjective perceptions of future mobility, we employ panel data to construct 'objective' measures of expected gains and losses from redistribution for different categories of individuals. We find that such measures have considerable explanatory power and perform better than 'general mobility' indexes. We also find that preferences for redistribution respond to individual beliefs on what determines one's position in the social ladder. Ceteris paribus, people who believe that the American society offers 'equal opportunities are more averse to redistribution. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.</p>"

<p>This paper argues that social security enjoys wider political support than other welfare programs because: (i) retirees constitute the most homogeneous voting group, and (ii) the intragenerational redistribution component of social security induces low-income young to support this system. In a dynamically efficient overlapping generation economy with earnings heterogeneity, we show that, for sufficient income inequality and enough elderly in the population, a welfare system composed of a within-cohort redistribution scheme and an unfunded social security system represents the political equilibrium of a two-dimensional majoritarian election. Social security is sustained by retirees and low-income young; while intragenerational redistribution by low-income young. Unlike unidimensional voting model, our model suggests that to assess how changes in inequality affect the welfare state, the income distribution should be decomposed by age groups.

<p>We show that in business groups with efficient internal capital markets, resources may be channelled to either more- or less-profitable units. Depending on the amount of internal resources, a group may exit a market in response to increased competition, or channel funds to the subsidiary operating in that market. This has important implications for the strategic impact of group membership. Affiliation to a monopolistic subsidiary can make a cash-rich (poor) firm more (less) vulnerable to entry deterrence. Also, resource flexibility within a group makes subsidiaries' reaction functions flatter, thus discouraging rivals' strategic commitments when entry is accommodated.</p>"

<p>This paper aims at giving a critical picture of the expenditures in research, development and demonstration (RD&D) for renewable energy sources (RES) in the EU-15 Member States. By providing this objective a number of performance indicators are proposed, evaluated and discussed. RD&D performance is measured in terms of RD&D intensity, e.g. spending per unit of GDP, as well as with regard to RD&D output such as the number of patents in the different sectors of technology.</p>
<p>The evaluation of the funds spent can help the rationalisation of the efforts made to support renewable energy RD&D and facilitate the joint investments in RD&D activities. This perspective is essential for facing the increasing competition that the EU industry meets in the international markets for RES. The knowledge and rationalisation of the RD&D spending in research activities is the starting point for a common approach to strengthen the EU industry in this field of expected strong growth.

<p>Stroke is the second most common cause of death in the world. The aim of this study is to estimate stroke's direct costs and productivity losses in Italy from a societal perspective and to explain cost variability. A prospective observational multicentre cost of illness study was designed. Four hundred and forty-nine consecutive patients admitted because of acute first-ever stroke in 11 Italian hospitals were enrolled. Costs and outcomes were assessed at patients' enrolment, and at 3, 6 and 12 months after discharge. Overall, social costs in the first six months following the attack were 11600euro per patient; 53% of this was health care costs, 39% non-health care costs and the remaining 8% productivity losses. Age, level of disability and type of hospital ward were the most significant predictors of six-month social costs. The acute phase counted for more than 50% of total health care costs, leaving the remaining 50% to the post-acute phase, indicating that follow-up should be on the agenda of policy makers also.</p>"

<p>We investigate what factors are required in order to succeed in project-based cultural industries. In particular, we focus on the effects of relational stability and reputation on two key dimensions of movies' success: commercial success and artistic merit. We combine the two dimensions of films' performance for a more accurate understanding of how authenticity and artistic merit are manufactured in the movie industry. We examine this question by analysing a sample of Italian films and focusing on the role of the film director. We argue that commercial success is favoured by a director's strong vertical ties (with producers and distributors) and economic reputation, while artistic merit is positively affected by a director's weak horizontal ties (with other creative partners) and artistic reputation. We propose an explanation in terms of varying degrees of task routineness and we use it to account for the divergence between our results and others in the cultural and organizational literature.</p>"

<p>Data are now readily available for a very large number of macroeconomic variables that are potentially useful when forecasting. We argue that recent developments in the theory of dynamic factor models enable such large data sets to be summarized by relatively few estimated factors, which can then be used to improve forecast accuracy. In this paper we construct a large macroeconomic data set for the UK, with about 80 variables, model it using a dynamic factor model, and compare the resulting forecasts with those from a set of standard time-series models. We find that just six factors are sufficient to explain 50% of the variability of all the variables in the data set. These factors, which can be shown to be related to key variables in the economy, and their use leads to considerable improvements upon standard time-series benchmarks in terms of forecasting performance.

<p>Quality-of-life (QOL) is an important outcome in clinical research, particularly in cancer clinical trials. Typically, data are collected longitudinally from patients during treatment and subsequent follow-up. Missing data are a common problem, and missingness may arise in a non-ignorable fashion. In particular, the probability that a patient misses an assessment may depend on the patient's QOL at the time of the scheduled assessment. We propose a Markov chain model for the analysis of categorical outcomes derived from QOL measures. Our model assumes that transitions between QOL states depend on covariates through generalized logit models or proportional odds models. To account for non-ignorable missingness, we incorporate logistic regression models for the conditional probabilities of observing measurements, given their actual values. The model can accommodate time-dependent covariates. Estimation is by maximum likelihood, summing over all possible values of the missing measurements. We describe options for selecting parsimonious models, and we study the finite-sample properties of the estimators by simulation. We apply the techniques to data from a breast cancer clinical trial in which QOL assessments were made longitudinally, and in which missing data frequently arose.

<p>The empirical analysis of monetary policy requires the construction of instruments for future expected inflation. Dynamic factor models have been applied rather successfully to inflation forecasting. In fact, two competing methods have recently been developed to estimate large-scale dynamic factor models based, respectively, on static and dynamic principal components. This paper combines the econometric literature on dynamic principal components and the empirical analysis of monetary policy. We assess the two competing methods for extracting factors on the basis of their success in instrumenting future expected inflation in the empirical analysis of monetary policy. We use two large data sets of macroeconomic variables for the USA and for the Euro area. Our results show that estimated factors do provide a useful parsimonious summary of the information used in designing monetary policy. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>Spoligotyping was compared with RFLP fingerprinting analysis in the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Spoligotyping.. sensitivity was 97.6% with a specificity of 47%. The global probability for two strains clustered with spoligotyping to be clustered also with RFLP analysis was 33%; the probability for two strains clustered with RFLP analysis to be clustered also with spoligotyping analysis was 95%. However, comparing the two methods in five outbreak episodes, full concordance was evidenced between spoligotyping and RFLP. Moreover, we evaluated the presence of our 17 largest spoligotyping clusters in spoligotyping databases from Caribbean countries, London and Cuba. Only five out of 17 patterns were present in all the cohorts. The conditional probability comparing spoligotyping and RFLP methods related to these patterns resulted in very low concordance (range from 2 to 38%). In conclusion, we confirm that spoligotyping when used alone overestimates the number of recent transmission and does not represent a suitable method for wide clinical practice application. However, it allows to get a first good picture of strain identity in a new setting and in more localized or confined settings, the probability of reaching the same result compared to RFLP was 100% confirming the usefulness of spoligotyping in the management of epidemic events, especially in hospitals, prisons and close communities.

<p>Objectives: This study aimed to identify, measure and evaluate expected costs of innovative palonosetron-based antiemetic therapy versus ondansetron-based treatment, the ultimate aim being to measure the drug price ratio (DPR) of the two pharmacological treatments in five different European countries.</p>
<p>Methods: A decision model compared two antiemetic treatments - palonosetron and ondansetron - in terms of expected costs of emesis management from a hospital perspective. The model was compiled for 374 patients. The clinical superiority of palonosetron in preventing acute and delayed emesis, measured in terms of: (i) complete response rates, (ii) number of emetic episodes, and (iii) administration of rescue medication, was derived from a previously published clinical trial. The cost data were gathered through economic questionnaires distributed in 11 European hospital centres. The expected costs of emesis management with palonosetron and ondansetron at ondansetron prices were used to calculate the DPR for palonosetron in each of the five European countries.</p>
<p>Results: In the baseline analysis, DPR varied from 1.55 (in Russia) to 2.60 (in the UK). The sensitivity analysis of the unit costs of emetic episodes and rescue medication identified a range from 1.39 (in Germany) to 4.09 (in Russia). Even in the least favourable clinical scenario, palonosetron was a preferred antiemetic strategy with a DPR > 1 in all five countries.</p>
<p>Conclusions: This is the first economic evaluation analysis of palonosetron. The results demonstrate that palonosetron, because of its superior clinical efficacy in controlling emesis, could have a favourable DPR when compared with ondansetron in all five countries considered and still offer lower or equal net treatment costs for the hospital.</p>"

<p>The paper identifies conditions under which asymmetric equilibria may exist when carriers compete in designing their network configurations in a game-theoretical framework. Two carriers are assumed here, which are allowed to play three different strategies: point-to-point (PP), hub-and-spoke (HS) or multi-hub. We find two main stable outcomes, which depend on the size of the internal market. First, when the internal markets are small, PP network strategies are played by both carriers, while for a specific subset of parameters a collusive equilibrium in a HS configuration can be derived. Second, when the size of the internal markets is large, asymmetric configurations, where one carrier chooses a HS strategy and the other chooses a PP strategy, are the only stable equilibria. The result can be used to describe the coexistence of alternative business models that have recently emerged in the aviation industry: the established full-service model based on the HS system and the recent low-cost model based on the PP system.

<p>A widespread approach in the implementation of asset pricing models is based on the periodic recalibration of its parameters and initial conditions to eliminate any conflict between model-implied and market prices. Modern no-arbitrage market models facilitate this procedure since their solution can usually be written in terms of the entire initial yield curve. As a result, the model fits (by construction) the interest rate term structure. This procedure is, however, generally time inconsistent since the model at time t = 0 completely specifies the set of possible term structures for any t > 0. In this paper, we analyze the pros and-cons of this widespread approach in pricing and hedging, both theoretically and empirically. The theoretical section of the paper shows (a) under which conditions recalibration improves the hedging errors by limiting the propagation of an initial error, (b) that recalibration introduces time-inconsistent errors that violate the self-financing argument of the standard replication strategy. The empirical section of the paper quantifies the trade-off between (a) and (b) under several scenarios. First, we compare this trade-off for two economies with and without model specification error. Then, we discuss the trade-off when the underlying economy is not Markovian. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

We characterise the equilibria and their welfare properties under various price regimes. We show that discrimination based on immutable characteristics such as gender is a dominant strategy, either when firms offer policies at a fixed price or when they charge according to some consumption variable that is correlated to costs. In the latter case, gender discrimination can be an outcome of strategic interaction alone in situations where it would not be adopted by a monopolist. Strategic price discrimination may also increase cross subsidies between types, contrary to expectations.</p>"

<p>Employment protection legislation (EPL) is not enforced uniformly across the board. There are a number of exemptions to the coverage of these provisions: firms below a given threshold scale and workers with temporary contracts are not subject to the most restrictive provisions. This within-country variation in enforcement allows us to make inferences on the impact of EPL which go beyond the usual cross-country approach. In this paper we develop a simple model which explains why these exemptions are in place to start with. Then we empirically assess the effects of EPL on dismissal probabilities and on the equilibrium size distribution of firms. Our results are in line with the predictions of the theoretical model. Workers under permanent contracts in firms with less restrictive EPL are more likely to be dismissed. However, there is no effect of the exemption threshold on the growth of firms.

<p>This paper demonstrates how a target for money growth can be beneficial for an inflation-targeting central bank acting under discretion. Because the growth rate of money is closely related to the change in the interest rate and the growth of real output, delegating a money growth target to the central bank makes discretionary policy more inertial, leading to better social outcomes. This delegation scheme is also compared with other schemes suggested in the literature. The results indicate that stabilizing money growth around a target can be a sensible strategy for monetary policy, although other delegation schemes are often more efficient.</p>"

<p>This study builds a framework to investigate the current trends emerging in hospital organizational design and its main consequences on human resources management. The analysis derives from an extensive literature review, which shows over the last 30 years a significant lack of works on organization design for hospitals, and from a number of experiences in hospital settings, which provide useful insights on changes taking place in hospitals. We intend to contribute to the filling of the gap in literature created by the lack of interest scholars have shown on hospital organization. The framework we discuss depicts the major converging trends of reorganization that can be observed in hospital contexts of industrialized countries. What we found is that large multi-specialty hospitals - by large we mean hospitals over about 300 beds - located in different countries, though starting from different internal and external organizational and environmental features are mostly converging towards a common design scheme.(1) We labelled that scheme the care-focused hospital and we analysed in-depth its features in the attempt to facilitate cross-national comparison, otherwise difficult due to the fact that organizational concepts are value loaded and tend to be culture-bound. Challenges and managerial implications of this more and more widely diffused organizational paradigm are debated in the last part of the study. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

<p>There has recently been a resurgence of interest in social and environmental reporting (SER) in both the private and the public sector; however, its meaning and application in the public sector are relatively new, and it has been little investigated. Our article is aimed at gaining a better understanding of the reasons underlying the adoption of SER by Italian local authorities by applying the concept of management fashion (Abrahamson 1996). Empirical analysis shows that both socio-psychological and techno-economic forces combine to shape the SER phenomenon, and a managerial fashion is currently in place among Italian local authorities. Thus, even when SER is adopted in response to 'technical' gaps, its label largely depends on its being driven by the need to signal that LAs are adopting a tool which is gaining momentum in academic and professional discourse. However, both forces are influenced not so much by a concern for sustainability as by the context of public-sector reform processes.</p>"

<p>We argue that embedding endowment-based comparative advantage within a standard NEG framework helps solve the indeterminacy due to multiple equilibria and the ambiguity concerning the relation between integration and specialisation (monotonicity versus non-monotonicity) typical of the NEG literature. In particular, we show that if endowments are in the FPE set, the process of trade integration involves an overshooting of international specialisation and relative factor prices with respect to the free trade level determined by factor abundance. In contrast, if endowments are outside the FPE set, then, even in the presence of agglomeration forces, specialisation and factor prices are monotonically related to trade costs, as implied by the standard trade theory. We argue that the model can shed light on some puzzling stylised facts. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>International migration can significantly increase income per capita in Europe. We estimate that at the given wage and productivity gap between Western and Eastern Europe, migration of 3% of the Eastern population to the West could increase total EU GDP by up to 0.5%. Yet on 1 May 2004, 14 EU countries out of 15 adopted transitional arrangements vis-d-vis the new member states and national migration restrictions vis-a-vis third county nationals are getting stricter and stricter. In this paper we offer two explanations for this paradox and document their empirical relevance in the case of the EU enlargement. The first explanation is that immigration to rigid labour markets involves a number of negative externalities on the native population. The second explanation is that there are important cross-country spillovers in the effects of migration policies, inducing a race-to-the top in border restrictions with high costs in terms of foregone European output. In light of our results, we discuss, in the final section, the key features of a desirable migration policy to be coordinated at the EU level.</p>"

<p>This article examines the question of change and the role of leaders in this process. In search of a formula which allows organisations to adapt without drowning in chaos the authors studied Shell, Siemens and DaimlerChrysler for three and a half years in the 1980s and 1990s. They discovered that the negative aspects of change can be avoided if leaders take a company's core values into account and engage employees when they guide their organisation through times of change. Such a leadership approach requires good actions by followers and the team and therefore a large talent pool. Shell and Siemens were able to fare better than DaimlerChrysler in this respect. They were able to take this approach due to a collective leadership style. A charismatic and overambitious leader, however, presented the greatest danger to the performance and survival of an organisation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This study aimed to compare the efficacy of collaborative learning in face-to-face and online groups. Fifty psychology majors learnt the same professional skill (a community evaluation methodology) in two seminars taught over a two month period by the same teacher online and face-to-face. Participants in both seminars achieved similar growth in level of professional competence, academic self-efficacy, social self-efficacy and self efficacy for problem solving among members. Post-course evaluation of collaborative experience showed no significant differences between online and face-to-face seminar participants in perceived social presence, cooperation and satisfaction with the learning experience. Our results support the claim of advocates of third generation distance education methodologies that computers can be an effective enabler, not only of independent learning, but also of collaborative learning. Furthermore, computer-supported collaborative learning environments are as efficient as collaborative learning in face-to-face seminars in developing social presence and increasing professional competencies and self-efficacy.

A simple model of capital market equilibrium with incomplete information. Journal of Finance 42, 483-510]; it involves both a stock market and a market for loans, together with negative externalities produced by a subset of firms. Importantly, the technological production structure of the firms is reflected in the properties of the shares traded in the stock market. Agents are heterogeneous in their financial choices, potentially discriminating against the firms producing a negative externality. The model sheds light on the utility costs of the discriminating behavior and on the impact on the price of the stock issued by the firm which is responsible for the externality. The model is used to study the factors which may magnify or reduce the impact of discrimination. A set of discriminated firms may be seriously affected only if the discriminating investors command a large portion of overall wealth and/or they do not represent important diversification instruments. The model can be applied to understanding the effects of socially responsible investment, whereby investors discriminate against companies belonging to some sectors which are perceived as socially dangerous or unethical.

<p>Existing studies, largely based in transaction cost economics, approach the issue of vertical scope as the decision of the individual firm about whether to make or buy, given the set of existing markets and well defined vertical segments. However, recent research has shown that the ability to make or buy should not be taken for granted. We argue that this applies not only to dis-integration, but also to re-integration, which often demands new 'all-in-one' markets. Drawing on the British building industry, we develop an inductive framework to explain why, after long periods of vertical specialization, industries shift to vertical reintegration. We observe that various groups, including professionals, play an active role in shaping the nature and the boundaries of the industry, facilitating the onset of vertical specialization, which, in turn, shapes a number of increasingly distinct knowledge bases in the industry, defining the trajectories along which capabilities evolve over time. As specialization in scope begets specialization in knowledge, difficulties in managing technical and organizational interdependencies arise, especially in the face of changing environmental conditions. The gap between what the vertically specialized system can produce, and what a changing environment demands, sets in motion a process of experimentation with integrated service provision, which is strengthened by broader social forces such as the deinstitutionalization of professions, or changes in demand structure. Reintegration is advanced by firms seeking to protect their position; enter new, related markets; or find new ways of leveraging their capabilities: Firms strategize to change their institutional environment, helping to create new all-in-one, integrated markets.</p>"

<p>This paper builds upon current research into the organizational implications of modularity'. Advocates of modularity argue that the 'invisible hand' of markets is reaching activities previously controlled through the visible hand of hierarchies. This paper argues that there are cognitive limits to the extent of division of labour: what kinds of problems firms solve, and how they solve them, set limits to the extent of division of labour, irrespective of the extent of the market. This paper analyses the cognitive limits to the division of labour, relying on an in-depth case study of engineering design activities. On this basis, it explains why coordinating increasingly specialized bodies of knowledge, and increasingly distributed learning processes, requires the presence of knowledge-integrating firms even in the presence of modular products. Such firms, relying on their wide in-house scientific and technological capabilities, have the 'authority' to identify, propose and implement solutions to complex problems. In so doing, they coordinate networks of suppliers of both components and specialized competencies.</p>"

<p>Background. We report on a single-institutional experience with renal transplantation in patients with severe lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) who underwent bladder augmentation or urinary diversion, and assess the long-term results.</p>
<p>Methods. From September 1987 to January 2005, 255 patients (161 male and 94 female), 7 months to 39 years old of age (median age at time of transplantation 14 years), received 271 kidney transplants. Etiology of end-stage renal disease was LUTD in 83 cases. Among these patients, 24 had undergone bladder augmentation or urinary diversion.</p>
<p>Results. We identified two groups of patients surgically treated due to LUTD: group 1 included 16 patients (eight male, eight female) aged 4 to 39 years (median 19 years) with bladder augmentation, whereas in group 2, seven patients (five male, two female) 7 months to 31 years old (median 17 years) with incontinent urinary diversion were reported. In the first group, surgical complications after kidney transplantation included one urinary fistula, one ureteral stenosis. Three patients of second group developed recurrent urinary tract infection. Cumulative graft survival rates of all patients transplanted was 69.4% after 15 years, whereas in the two investigated groups, group 1 and group 2, was 80.7% and 55.5% respectively (P=NS.).</p>
<p>Conclusions. Drainage of transplanted kidneys into an augmented bladder or urinary diversion is an appropriate management strategy when the native bladder is unsuitable. Kidney transplantation in patients with bladder augmentation or urinary diversion for LUTD let achieve similar results to those obtained in the general population with normal lower urinary tracts.</p>"

<p>In this paper, we assess the possibility of producing unbiased forecasts for fiscal variables in the Euro area by comparing a set of procedures that rely on different information sets and econometric techniques. In particular, we consider autoregressive moving average models, Vector autoregressions, small-scale semistructural models at the national and Euro area level, institutional forecasts (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), and pooling. Our small-scale models are characterized by the joint modelling of fiscal and monetary policy using simple rules, combined with equations for the evolution of all the relevant fundamentals for the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. We rank models on the basis of their forecasting performance using the mean square and mean absolute error criteria at different horizons. Overall, simple time-series methods and pooling work well and are able to deliver unbiased forecasts, or slightly upward-biased forecast for the debt-GDP dynamics. This result is mostly due to the short sample available, the robustness of simple methods to structural breaks, and to the difficulty of modelling the joint behaviour of several variables in a period of substantial institutional and economic changes. A bootstrap experiment highlights that, even when the data are generated using the estimated small-scale multi-country model, simple time-series models can produce more accurate forecasts, because of their parsimonious specification.</p>"

<p>In this paper, we evaluate the role of a set of variables as leading indicators for Euro-area inflation and GDP growth.

We compare the forecasting performance of each indicator ex post with that of purely autoregressive models. We also analyse three different approaches to combining the information from several indicators. First, ex post, we discuss the use as indicators of the estimated factors from a dynamic factor model for all the indicators. Secondly, within an ex ante framework, an automated model selection procedure is applied to models with a large set of indicators. No future information is used, future values of the regressors are forecast, and the choice of the indicators is based on their past forecasting records. Finally, we consider the forecasting performance of groups of indicators and factors and methods of pooling the ex ante single-indicator or factor-based forecasts. Some sensitivity analyses are also undertaken for different forecasting horizons and weighting schemes of forecasts to assess the robustness of the results.</p>"

<p>Social policy is often considered the key element of European identity. Should it however be one for all? A common taxonomy refer to four distinct social Europe(s) : Nordic, Anglo-Saxon, Continental and Mediterranean. It has lost some of its capacity to explain cross-country differences in the social policy mix. There is a mild convergence in levels, in the size of social Europes, while countries are still different in tern of composition of social policy expenditure. Activism in reforming social policy institutions increased since 1996, notably in the convergence of EMU. European harmonisation in social policy institutions can not be justified by the presence of economies of scale or of spillovers across jurisdictions. Performances of social welfare system appear better in the small EU countries. So, the EU-level decisions making should not impose a harmonisation of the different social Europe but promote exchanges of information and let the different social systems compete.</p>"

Given that the degree of supervision consolidation seems to be inversely correlated with central bank involvement in supervision itself, the paper sheds light on the possible explanation of this trade-off. The trade off is tested using Probit techniques with a sample of 68 countries.</p>"

<p>The literature on long waves gives great emphasis to the process of the diffusion of new pervasive technologies that raise productivity and growth, first in the sectors that generate them, then in those sectors that progressively adopt them. This paper explores this process of diffusion, relying on an ongoing analysis of the diffusion of robotized, modular production process in the international tire industry. The analysis captures three key features of the diffusion process of the long wave. First, we look at the emergence of radical innovations in mature sectors through the adoption of pervasive technologies, i.e. robotics. Second, we see that the adoption of the new process goes hand in hand with the adoption of new organizational routines at the level of both design and manufacturing processes, modularity. Third, this study highlights the role played by key individuals entrepreneurs-who develop new ways of doing business.</p>"

<p>We provide empirical evidence on market positioning by firms, in terms of market niche, distance from technological frontier and dispersion.

Market positioning is a function of the type of firms (incumbents versus entrants), market size and contestability as well as firm competencies. We find that incumbents specialize in high-end segments and disperse their product in a larger spectrum of the market. Instead, entrants focus on specific market niches.

<p>The paper aims at understanding the relation between corporate governance (CG) and corporate social responsibility (CSR). In theory,, CG refers mainly to the mechanisms which protect outsiders and ensure an effective working of the firm, while CSR refers mainly to the objective function of the firm and the attention for various stakeholders. The paper discusses these concepts, with particular attention to the relation between CSR and profit maximization. This relation is important to evaluate which actions are truly socially responsible and which actions are simply profit maximization in disguise. The available empirical evidence shows that both CG and CSR are positively related to the market value of the firm. This suggests that in the long run the market mechanism should be able to provide additional resources to those companies which are best at maximizing a widely defined bottom line.</p>"

<p>This paper aims at measuring the social benefits of small CHP distributed generation (DG) in the residential and service sectors. We do this by comparing the social costs of decentralised and centralised supplies, simulating ""ideal"" situations in which any source of allocative inefficiencies is eliminated. This comparison focuses on assessing internal and external costs. The internal costs are calculated by simulating the optimal prices of the electricity and gas inputs. The external costs are estimated by using and elaborating the results of the dissemination process of the ExternE project, one of the most recent and accurate methodologies in this field. The analysis takes into account the main sources of uncertainty about the parameter values, including uncertainty about external cost estimations. Despite these sources of uncertainty, the paper concludes that centralised supply is still preferable to small DG. In fact, the overall range of DG social competitiveness is restricted, even considering further remarkable improvements in DG electrical efficiency and investment costs. The results are particularly unfavourable for the residential sector, whereas, in the service sector, the performance of DG technologies is slightly better. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>In this paper, we evaluate the relative merits of three alternative approaches to extracting information from a large data set for forecasting, namely, the use of an automated model selection procedure, the adoption of a factor model, and the adoption of single-indicator-based forecast pooling.

We also compare our large set of leading indicators with purely autoregressive models, using an evaluation procedure that is particularly relevant for policy making. The evaluation is conducted both ex post and in a pseudo-real-time context, for several forecast horizons, and using both recursive and rolling estimation. The results indicate a preference for simple forecasting tools, with a good relative performance of pure autoregressive models, and substantial instability in the characteristics of the leading indicators.

<p>This work illustrates a new method for estimating the importance of assumptions in investment evaluation. The most diffused sensitivity analysis schemes present limitations when used to assess the importance of individual parameters and cannot be employed to estimate the importance of groups of assumptions. However, such problems can be solved by making use of the differential importance measure (DIM). We set forth the framework for the application of DIM at the parameter level of investment valuation models. We study the relationship between DIM and investment marginal behavior. We analyze the link between importance of a parameter and risk associated with it. We discuss general results for a sample valuation model. The numerical application to the valuation of an energy sector investment project follows. We rank the factors based on their importance and determine the project risk profile. We discuss the importance of groups of assumptions. Results will show that assumptions relating to revenues are the most influential ones, followed by discounting and operating cost assumptions. We discuss numerically the relationship between importance and risk, analyzing the effect of variable costs hedging through the comparison of the project risk profile in the presence and in the absence of such a hedging.

Findings confirm that the relative size of the company (a proxy for firm's internal resources) is still relevant among SMEs; in addition, the geographical area where SMEs are located (environmental resources) can act as a further obstacle especially for the smaller companies of the sample; finally, specific ICT organizational strategies - namely the outsourcing decisions - proved to be an important mitigating factor for size and location-based broadband disadvantages.</p>"

<p>This paper uses an endogenous coalition formation game to derive an upper bound to industry concentration. The proposed coalitional stability concept assumes that firms are endowed with foresight in that they look ahead and anticipate the ultimate outcome of their actions. It is shown that while in exogenous sunk cost industries the upper bound to concentration falls as the market becomes large, in endogenous sunk cost industries, regardless of the size of the market, arbitrarily concentrated outcomes can arise in equilibrium. In addition, for this second class of industries, if products are sufficiently good substitutes, then duopoly coalition structures can only be sustained in equilibrium if composed of sufficiently size asymmetric coalitions.

<p>This paper presents an empirical analysis of the determinants of research cooperation between firms and Public research organisations (PROs) for a sample of innovating small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The econometric analysis is based on the results of the KNOW survey carried out in seven EU countries during 2000. In contrast to earlier works that provide information about the importance of PROs' research, we know the number of firm/PRO collaborative research and development (R&D) projects. This allows us to study the determinants of firm collaboration with PROs in terms of both the propensity of a firm to undertake R&D projects with a university (do they cooperate or not) and the extent of this collaboration (number of R&D projects). Two questions are addressed. Which firms cooperated with PROs? And what are the firm characteristics that might explain the number of R&D projects with PROs? The results of our analysis point to two major phenomena. First, the propensity to forge an agreement with an academic partner depends on the 'absolute size' of the industrial partner. Second the openness of firms to the external environment, as measured by their willingness to search, screen and signal, significantly affects the development of R&D projects with PROs. Our findings suggest that acquiring knowledge through the screening of publications and involvement in public policies positively affects the probability of signing an agreement with a PRO, but not the number of R&D projects developed. In fact, firms that outsource research and development, and patent to protect innovation and to signal competencies show higher levels of collaboration. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

<p>A common finding in the empirical literature on the validity of purchasing power parity (PPP) is that it holds when tested for in panel data, but not in univariate (i.e. country-specific) analysis. The usual explanation for this mismatch is that panel tests for unit roots are more powerful than their univariate counterparts. In this paper we suggest an alternative explanation. Existing panel methods assume that cross-unit cointegrating relationships, that would tie the units of the panel together, are not present. Using simulations, we show that if this important underlying assumption of panel unit root tests is violated, the empirical size of the tests is substantially higher than the nominal level, and the null hypothesis of a unit root is rejected too often even when it is true. More generally, this finding warns against the ""automatic"" use of panel methods for testing for unit roots in macroeconomic time series.</p>"

<p>Results: The response rate was 46.8% (175 questionnaires). All respondents stated that the basics of economic evaluation analysis must be part of the overall knowledge of health-care professionals. The usefulness of economic evaluation for professional activities was rated 3.83 (scale 1-5). Respondents stated that economic evaluation is used more for managerial decisions than for clinical ones (mean 2.89 vs. 2.74, P = 0.09).

<p>New Member States (NMS) coming from central planning are often advised against early Euro adoption because of their rigid labour markets. But are labour markets so rigid in these countries? We argue in this paper that this is not the case. Labour market institutions are no more ""rigid"" than among current EMU Members whilst wage bargaining institutions are actually better equipped for microeconomic wage flexibility than in the EU-15. NMS also achieved substantial reallocation of jobs and workers in the transition to markets, display relatively large job turnover rates and are reducing their regional mismatch. The view that NMS have rigid labour markets is fuelled by the low job content of growth in the region. But there is evidence that the latter is related to productivity enhancing job destruction in the aftermath of prolonged labour hoarding. Reduced-form employment equations estimated in this paper also suggest that tight fiscal policies, rather than being harmful to job creation, may actually improve the employment performance of the region. Our interpretation of this result is that loose fiscal policies weaken the confidence of investors and crowd-out private employment growth through generous pay rises to civil servants.

<p>The performance of the small natural gas-fired power technologies has improved remarkably over the last decade. This has aroused the interest of operators, regulators and legislators in natural gas-fired distributed generation (gas-fired DG), namely, the integrated or stand-alone use of small, modular gas-fired power generation close to the point of consumption as an alternative to large power generation and electricity transport over long distances. Gas-fired DG can provide an important benefit from the environmental point of view. Customer proximity, in fact, greatly increases the potential for combined heat and power generation, involving energy saving and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Unfortunately this kind of decentralized supply also determines higher non-GHG emissions (mainly NOx, compared to the best available central power technology) which occur in urban areas (high populated) instead of extra-urban areas (where large power plants are generally located). It is therefore difficult to make a reliable evaluation of gas-fired DG environmental benefits without comparing centralized and decentralized models in terms of external costs, that is without an analysis which allows us to compare the extent of global and local-regional impacts in terms of monetary damage. If, on the one hand, this underlines the (potential) importance of the methods adopted to assess the economic value of environmental externalities (even for policy decisions that are binary, i.e. the choice between different energy technologies), on the other, it raises the crucial question of the uncertainty about the economic estimates. This article aims at demonstrating that the uncertainty about external costs, even if large, does not undermine the possibility of verifying whether gas-fired DG is preferable (or not) to centralized supply. The paper compares centralized and decentralized models in terms of the external environmental costs which are calculated by using the results of the available studies in this field (in particular the results of the dissemination process of the so-called ExternE project, one of the most recent and accurate methodologies, and the results of a meta-analysis, with regard to the marginal cost of GHG emissions). The uncertainty about external costs is substantial but not so large that it is not possible to say anything about the environmental raking of alternative technology solutions involving trade-off between the impacts of different pollutants (or between different kinds of impacts). The literature on external costs provides several studies accounting for a large part of uncertainty by means of appropriate statistical and sensitive analysis. By using and elaborating these results, the analysis described in this paper seems to support the conclusion that centralized supply, and especially the completely electric solution (based on the reversible electric heat pump), is still preferable to natural gas-fired CHP distributed generatio"

We briefly introduce machine learning algorithms to build decision trees and rule sets and then apply such algorithms to delineate the key features which distinguish Austrian and Italian pathways to adulthood, using Fertility and Family Survey data. The key role of sequencing and synchronization between events emerges clearly from the analysis.</p>"

<p>Cost-of-illness (COI) was the first economic evaluation technique used in the health field. The principal aim was to measure the economic burden of illness to society. Its usefulness as a decision-making tool has however been questioned since its inception. The main criticism came from welfare economists who rejected CON because they were not grounded in welfare economics theory. Other attacks related to the use of the human capital approach (HCA) to evaluate morbidity and mortality costs since it was said that the HCA had nothing to do with the value people attach to their lives. Finally, objections were made that COI could not be of any help to decision makers and that other forms of economic evaluation (e.g. cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit analysis) would be much more useful to those taking decisions and ranking priorities. Conversely, it is here suggested that COI can be a good economic tool to inform decision makers if it is considered from another perspective. COI is a descriptive study that can provide information to support the political process as well as the management functions at different levels of the healthcare organisations. To do that, the design of the study must be innovative, capable of measuring the true cost to society; to estimate the main cost components and their incidence over total costs; to envisage the different subjects who bear the costs; to identify the actual clinical management of illness; and to explain cost variability. In order to reach these goals, COI need to be designed as observational bottom-up studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Researchers are divided on the trends and causes of internal migration in postsocialist Central and Eastern Europe. Theories run in opposite directions: some scholars argue that increasing similarities with Western market economies are explaining the migration processes, whereas others claim that specific developments during the postsocialist socioeconomic restructuring are playing a major role. In this paper we contribute to the existing discussion by providing an analysis of personal and contextual determinants of migration to urban and rural destinations in post-Soviet Estonia. We base our study on the data of the Estonian Labour Force Survey from 1995. Our research population consists of 8480 people aged 15 years to 68 years in early 1989. We analyze the intensity of urban-bound and rural-bound migration from January 1989 to December 1994, using the techniques of multilevel event-history analysis. We show that personal characteristics (age, marital status, employment status, education, and ethnicity) and contextual factors (unemployment level and the share of ethnic minorities) are both important in shaping the intensity of migration to urban and rural destinations in post-Soviet Estonia. Although the differences in migration behaviour by demographic characteristics in Estonia are in line with universalistic explanations, the regionally varying effect of socioeconomic status on migration is specific to developments in postsocialist countries, as a result of general economic hardship during the socioeconomic transition.</p>"

<p>This paper examines the determinants of adoption of Internet banking among Italian retail banks. In particular it aims at investigating the nature of Internet banking in relation to traditional banking activity. In doing so, the paper analyses the role of firm-specific and market-specific characteristics in affecting the decision to provide financial services via the Internet. The empirical analysis indicates that the adoption of Internet banking depends upon the characteristics of traditional banking activities, particularly in terms of existing networks of distribution and existing customers. First, banks with high branching intensity adopt more slowly than banks with a few branches in place. Second, adoption is negatively affected by the existence of a large customer base, once we control for assets. An important consequence of this is that the provision of financial services over the Internet is a strategy directed more at attracting new customers than at strengthening the relationship with existing ones.

<p>Paternalism, merit goods and specific egalitarianism are concepts we sometimes meet in the literature. The thing in common is that the policy maker does not fully respect the consumer sovereignty principle and designs policies according to some other criterion than individuals' preferences.

<p>Background: Institutionalized international nurse training organized by national educational institutions is a relatively new phenomenon. This, descriptive case study examines an early example of an American-Italian initiative of such training, in order to stimulate future international education of nurses.</p>
<p>Aim: To find out what factors have to be taken into account to improve training and what its potential effects are in exchange and also in the context of nurse migration.</p>
<p>Method: A questionnaire was sent to the 85 nurses who all participated in this particular international programme (response rate: 30.6%).</p>
<p>Findings: The collected data indicate that personalized and well-aimed training, preparatory language courses, predeparture exposure of nurses to the culture of the host country and well-prepared welcomes are among the most important ways to improve this programme.</p>
<p>Implications for practice: While the specific circumstances and cultures involved in this particular case study should not be ignored, these factors might also be applied to maximize the positive effects of nurse-migration. Two-way learning is among the positive effects of such an international training experience. Motivational and team-building effects can result in enhanced quality of care and a more efficient allocation of resources. However, the mind-opening effect seems to be the most important learning experience. Therefore, regardless of whether one system is considered better or worse than another, experiencing a different way of nursing/education is considered the most important, enriching element of an international learning experience. The effects of this experience could include avoiding cultural imposition in the increased cultural diversity of nursing in the country of origin.</p>"

<p>In the setting of diffusion models for price evolution, we suggest an easily implementable approximate evaluation formula for measuring the errors in option pricing and hedging due to volatility misspecification. The main tool we use in this paper is a (suitably modified) classical inequality for the L-2 norm of the solution, and the derivatives of the solution, of a partial differential equation (the so-called ""energy"" inequality). This result allows us to give bounds on the errors implied by the use of approximate models for option valuation and hedging and can be used to justify formally some ""folk"" belief about the robustness of the Black and Scholes model. Surprisingly enough, the result can also be applied to improve pricing and hedging with an approximate model. When statistical or a priori information is available on the ""true"" volatility, the error measure given by the energy inequality can be minimized w.r.t. the parameters of the approximating model. The method suggested in this paper can help in conjugating statistical estimation of the volatility function derived from flexible but computationally cumbersome statistical models, with the use of analytically tractable approximate models calibrated using error estimates.</p>"

<p>This paper tests the presence of multiple independent submarkets in the Italian motor insurance industry. We find that independence effects are sufficient to induce a minimum degree of inequality in the size distribution of firms once submarkets are aggregated. These results are consistent with the predictions of Sutton [Sutton, J., 1998. Technology and market structure. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.]. At the submarket level, some degree of inequality can be explained by a model of equilibrium price dispersion based on costly consumer search. Our findings show that Sutton's limiting approach and one based on a game theoretical analysis of an industry are good complements when the industry is made of several independent submarkets.

<p>Modeling risk in a prescriptively plausible way represents a major issue in decision theory. The benchmarking procedure, being based on the satisficing principle and providing a probabilistic interpretation of expected utility (EU) theory, is prescriptive. Because it is a target-based language, the benchmarking procedure can be applied naturally to finance. In finance, the centrality of risk is widely recognized, but the risk measures that are commonly used to assess risk are too poor as a decision making tool. In this paper we propose a two-stage decision criterion of choice under risk that provides an application of benchmarking to finance through a risk measure. We will analyze some nonexpected utility theories, in particular lottery dependent utility, as potential frameworks for our criterion.</p>"

<p>This paper comments on Omri Ben Shahar's article ""An Ex-Ante View of the Battle of the Forms: Inducing Parties to Draft Reasonable Terms."" In that article, the author focuses on one type of ex ante effect of the battle of the forms: the incentive to draft reasonable boilerplate terms. He argues that the experience with the battle-of-the-forms rule under the CISG reinforces what we already know, that existing legal solutions do not provide any incentive for the parties to draft reasonable forms. He also suggests that the goal of inducing parties to draft reasonable terms can be significantly promoted by a third rule. a variant of the ""best-shot"" rule proposed by Victor Goldberg. Under this version. labeled the ""reasonable-shot"" rule, the court would resolve the battle of the forms by choosing the form that contains the more efficient terms.</p>

Consequently, virtual knowledge brokers help firms to complement the knowledge they can acquire through traditional physical and virtual channels for customer interaction.

<p>Stock index tracking requires to build a portfolio of stocks (a replica) whose behavior is as close as possible to that of a given stock index. Typically, much fewer stocks should appear in the replica than in the index, and there should be no low frequency or integrated (persistent) components in the tracking error. The latter property is not satisfied by many commonly used methods for index tracking. These are based on the in-sample minimization of a loss function, but do not take into account the dynamic properties of the index components. Moreover, most existing methods do not take into account the known structure of the index weight system. In this paper we represent the index components with a dynamic factor model. In this model the price of each stock in the index is driven by a set of common and idiosyncratic factors. Factors can be either integrated or stationary. We develop a procedure that, in a first step, builds a replica that is driven by the same persistent factors as the index. This procedure is grounded in recent results which suggest the application of principal component analysis for factor estimation even for integrated processes. In a second step, it is also possible to refine the replica so that it minimizes a specific loss function, as in the traditional approach. In both steps the replica weights depend on the existing information on the index weights system. An extended set of Monte Carlo simulations and an application to the most widely used index in the European stock market, the EuroStoxx50 index, provide substantial support for our approach.

The paper investigates devolution in Italy and proposes explanations for the substantial differentiation of outcomes that can be observed. The case of devolution in agriculture in Lombardy, investigated in depth in the article, is striking for the magnitude and rapidity of change as well as for the way the reallocation of the workforce to the lower levels of government has occurred.

<p>This study explores how Italian public hospitals can use private medical activities run by their employed physicians as a human resources management (HRM) tool. It is based on field research in two acute-care hospitals and a review of Italian literature and laws. The Italian National Health Service (NHS) allows employed physicians to run private, patient-funded activities (""private beds"", surgical operations, hospital outpatient clinics, etc.). Basic regulation is set at the national level, but it can be greatly improved at the hospital level. Private activities, if poorly managed, can damage efficiency, equity, quality of care, and public trust in the NHS. On the other hand, hospitals can also use them as leverage to improve HRM, with special attention to three issues: (1) professional evaluation, development, and training; (2) compensation policies; (3) competition for, and retention of, professionals in short supply. The two case studies presented here show great differences between the two hospitals in terms of regulation and organizational solutions that have been adopted to deal with such activities. However, in both hospitals, private activities do not seem to benefit HRM. Private activities are not systematically considered in compensation policies. Moreover, private revenues are strongly concentrated in a few physicians. Hospitals use very little of the information provided by the private activities to improve knowledge management, career development, or training planning. Finally, hospitals do not use private activities management as a tool for competing in the labor market for health professionals who are in short supply. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Through collective action and powerful representational practices, Premiere Vision's exhibitors affirm their style innovation and position themselves as trend setters. Our study extends the emerging literature on market forms and marketing practices by (i) introducing a different lens, based on the ideas of postmodern theorists, through which the nature of representation in industrial markets may be viewed and (ii) addressing the role of self-interested theorists, i.e. marketers who theorize about the market and its functioning in ways that are self-beneficial. Our paper also has implications for trade fair literature, which is mostly concerned with individual exhibitors' value appropriation strategies. The case of Premiere Vision shows that trade fairs may be considered as collective marketing instruments, thus highlighting the importance of organizers' value creation strategies.

<p>This introduction to the special issue discusses the notion of marketing competencies in buyer-supplier relationships, and the role these competencies play in creating value for the customer. Existing work on the role of competencies in industrial marketing has two main foci. The first, established approach deals with competencies as inputs to organizational processes, and seeks to establish in how far marketing competencies such as customer relationship management, channel design, etc. lead to superior financial returns. The second, emerging, approach focuses on the marketing of competencies as a source for customer value. This article uses supply and demand side perspectives to look at these two approaches and suggests a typolology involving four distinct value-creation strategies.

<p>This paper discusses the use of global sensitivity analysis (SA) techniques in investment decisions. Global SA complements and improves uncertainty analysis (UA) providing the analyst/decision- maker with information on how uncertainty is apportioned by the uncertain factors. In this work, we introduce global SA in the investment project evaluation realm. We then need to deal with two aspects: (1) the identification of the appropriate global SA method to be used and (2) the interpretation of the results from the decision maker point of view. For task 1, we compare the performance of two family of techniques: non-parametric and variance decomposition based. For task 2, we explore the determination of the cash flow global importance (GI) for valuation criteria utilized in investment project evaluation. For the net present value (NPV), we show that it is possible to derive an analytical expression of the cash flow GI, which is the same for all the techniques. This knowledge enables us to: (1) offer a direct way to compute cash flow GI; (2) illustrate the practical impact of global SA on the information collection process. For the internal rate of return (IRR), we show that the same conclusions cannot be driven. In particular, (a) one has to utilize a numerical approach for the computation of the cash flow influence, since an analytical expression cannot be found and (b) different techniques can produce different ranking. These observations are illustrated by means of the application to a model utilized in the energy sector for the evaluation of projects under survival risk. The quantitative comparison of cash flow ranking with respect to the NPV and IRR concludes the paper, illustrating that information obtained from the SA of the NPV cannot be transferred to the IRR.

<p>A wide literature exists, according to which small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) perform worse than large ones, due to the lack of human and financial resources that keeps SMEs from adopting new technological solutions and innovative managerial practices, necessary to improve the overall performances. This paper discusses the results of a research aimed at stating whether belonging to an industrial district enables firms to take advantage of the experience of the other members of the same cluster and, thus, to develop some organizational and managerial skills, which only large companies, endowed with a greater amount of human, technical and financial resources, can generally acquire. After a review of the main literature concerning industrial districts and manufacturing and logistics performances in large enterprises and in small-to-medium-sized ones, the paper presents the results of a survey that involves a comparison among three samples of large; small-to-medium and district plants of the mechanical industry. Data employed in this analysis have been collected through the Italian Best Factory Award and through an ad hoe survey in an Italian industrial district. The survey shows that large, SMEs and district companies focus on different performance categories, linked to some peculiar features of each typology. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

<p>We derive a set of stylized facts on the effects of non-systematic fiscal policy in the four largest countries of the Euro area. We find relevant differences across countries in the effects of non-systematic fiscal policy, and substantial uncertainty about the size of these effects. Yet, in general, expenditure shocks are usually rather ineffective in increasing output growth, and can require deficit financing. Tax policies also appear to have minor effects on output, but usually tax increases do not have negative effects. Disaggregating expenditures and receipts yields some interesting results, in particular increases in government consumption decrease output in all countries, while social benefits can increase it.

<p>Corporate entrepreneurship, the discovery and pursuit of new opportunities through innovation and venturing, is an important source of competitive advantage. Corporate entrepreneurship involves a diverse set of activities such as innovation in products and processes, the development of internal and external corporate ventures; and the development of new business models, which require an array of roles, behaviors, and individual competencies. In this article, we define individual competencies and distinguish them from other individual difference constructs. We argue that given the unique requirements of corporate entrepreneurship, a competency-based approach to assessing organizational human capital needs is superior to more traditional job-analytic methods. Drawing on existing literature, we outline a competency framework for supporting corporate entrepreneurship and infer the underlying, measurable knowledge, skills, and abilities that contribute to these competencies. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this framework for the staffing, training and development, and performance-appraisal practices of firms seeking to promote corporate entrepreneurship.

<p>The hazard rate of investment is derived within a real-option model, and its properties are analysed so as to directly study the relation between uncertainty and investment. Maximum likelihood estimates of the hazard are calculated using a sample of multinational enterprises (MNEs) that invested in Central and Eastern Europe over the period 1990-98. Employing a standard, non-parametric specification of the hazard, our measure of uncertainty has a negative effect on investment, but the reduced-form model is unable to control for nonlinearities in the relationship. The structural estimation of the option-based hazard is instead able to account for the nonlinearities and exhibits a significant value of waiting, although the latter is independent of our measure of uncertainty. This finding supports the existence of alternative channels through which uncertainty can affect investment.</p>"

<p>The critique by Levitas and Ndofor (this issue) challenges the author's earlier argument (Gibbert, this issue) on three grounds. It starts off by denying the existence of any paradox. Second, they argue that even if there were a paradox, attempts to ensure generalizability would actually hamper, rather than foster the development of the RBV. Finally, they observe that the problems of the RBV extend beyond generalizability and discuss a number of additional problems, in particular-construct validity. It was not within the scope of the author's original essay to assess the importance of other criteria that can be used to assess the quality of a theory. This response provides an opportunity to address this importance. The author first attempts to clarify the distinction between the logic of a situation and its implied methodology. Confusion of the two motivated, the author believes, Levitas and Ndofor's critique. The author then uses this distinction to address each of the three criticisms in turn.</p>"

<p>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has acquired an unquestionably high degree of relevance for a large number of different actors. Among others, academics and practitioners are developing a wide range of knowledge and best practices to further improve socially responsible competences. Within this context, one frequent question is according to what theory should general knowledge of CSR be developed, and in particular the relationship between CSR and small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). This paper suggests that research on large firms should be based on stakeholder theory, while research on CSR among SMEs should be based on the concept of social capital. This paper first provides a theoretical and practical perspective on CSR today; the focus then shifts to the specific literature on CSR and SMEs; some data and information follow on SMEs in Europe and Italy; finally, some conclusions and questions for future research are suggested.</p>"

We find strong evidence of persistence among top and bottom forecasting models and relate this to the possibility of improving performance through forecast combinations. We propose a new four-stage conditional model combination method that first sorts models into clusters based on their past performance, then pools forecasts within each cluster, followed by estimation of the optimal forecast combination weights for these clusters and shrinkage towards equal weights. These methods are shown to work well empirically in out-of-sample forecasting experiments. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

Which approach is better is an empirical matter: in theory, iterated forecasts are more efficient if the one-period ahead model is correctly specified, but direct forecasts are more robust to model misspecification. This paper compares empirical iterated and direct forecasts from linear univariate and bivariate models by applying simulated out-of-sample methods to 170 U.S. monthly macroeconomic time series spanning 1959-2002. The iterated forecasts typically outperform the direct forecasts, particularly, if the models can select long-lag specifications. The relative performance of the iterated forecasts improves with the forecast horizon. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Failure time data may consist of the observation of an event whose cause is unknown due to the censoring or lack of a second event that could identify the cause of the first event. Standard competing-risks methodology does not apply to this setting because the cause of the event is not always identifiable. Moreover, one cannot assume that the entire population will eventually experience the event of interest, and the observation is potentially censored for all patients. The model that we describe in this article is motivated by a breast cancer clinical trial conducted by the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG). Because some breast cancer adjuvant treatments for premenopausal patients who have undergone surgery cause the interruption of menses, or amenorrhoea, it is of interest to describe the process by which menses discontinue and resume after treatment is completed. The process is complicated by the fact that natural menopause also occurs in the patient population, and that treatment-induced amenorrhoea is not distinguishable from menopause unless menses are observed to resume after treatment completion. We discuss a parametric model for the time to amenorrhoea and for the time to the recovery of menses, also accounting for the presence of censoring and for the possibility that treatment causes an anticipation of natural menopause.

<p>Uncertainty importance measures are quantitative tools aiming at identifying the contribution of uncertain inputs to output uncertainty. Their application ranges from food safety (Frey & Patil (2002)) to hurricane losses (Iman et al. (2005a, 2005b)). Results and indications an analyst derives depend on the method selected for the study. In this work, we investigate the assumptions at the basis of various indicator families to discuss the information they convey to the analyst/decisionmaker. We start with nonparametric techniques, and then present variance-based methods. By means of an example we show that output variance does not always reflect a decisionmaker state of knowledge of the inputs. We then examine the use of moment-independent approaches to global sensitivity analysis, i.e., techniques that look at the entire output distribution without a specific reference to its moments. Numerical results demonstrate that both moment-independent and variance-based indicators agree in identifying noninfluential parameters. However, differences in the ranking of the most relevant factors show that inputs that influence variance the most are not necessarily the ones that influence the output uncertainty distribution the most.</p>"

<p>The expectations model of the term structure has been subjected to numerous empirical tests and almost invariably rejected, with the failure generally attributed to systematic expectations errors or to shifts in risk premia.

Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy 39, 195-214] specify that the central bank adjusts short-term yields in response to deviations of inflation and output gaps from target level. Such rules give a good empirical account of the behavior of the short-term interest rate. Combining the Taylor rule and expectations theory, it is possible to generate-along lines pioneered by Campbell and Shiller [1987. Cointegration and tests of present value models.

<p>Purpose - To analyse the power that a virtual brand community exerts over a brand of a mass-marketed convenience product.

<p>Findings - The virtual community that gathers around a convenience product brand shows a new form of sociality and customer empowerment: it is not based on interaction between peers, but more on personal self-exhibition in front of other consumers through the marks and rituals linked to the brand. The company should play the role of non-intrusive enabler of these personal expressions, reducing its control over the brand's meanings.</p>

<p>The Italian fashion industry rose to a position of international prominence in the second half of the twentieth century. An important factor in the sector's global success was the opening up of the international, particularly the American, markets. The changes that occurred within the fashion industry after World War II, most critically the end of the Parisian monopoly, offered opportunities that were exploited differently by the various competitors. While cities like London and New York managed to promote themselves as alternatives to Paris, Italy was initially unable to create a single fashion capital. Florence, Rome, and Milan felt themselves equally entitled to become the staging ground for Italian fashion production, but Milan, benefiting from certain features of its productive structure, eventually emerged as the winner. The city's success was based on a long, steady accumulation of resources and the ability to harness its creative and managerial capabilities. The result was Milan's emergence as a fashion ""superstar"" in the 1970s.</p>"

<p>In this paper, we test the uncovered interest rate parity (UIRP), allowing for transitory deviations from it. These deviations may arise from variations in risk premia, errors in expectations and linearization errors, and are modelled as a zero-mean noise around the restrictions implied by the UIRP on a vector autoregression (VAR) in the interest rate differential and the spot exchange rate. Importantly, this approach includes the traditional one as a special case, which is derived by simply setting the noise to zero. When the noise is set to zero the UIRP is rejected, but if we allow for some degree of noise the UIRP is strongly supported by the data. Thus the UIRP relation does not hold exactly, but on average, with a stationary risk premium as opposed to a constant one. This result implies that analysing the effects of policy experiments under the null of the UIRP may be both safe and useful.</p>"

<p>In the last decade, the Italian National Health Service has been characterized by the introduction of managerial concepts and techniques, according to the New Public Management paradigm. Recently, these reforms have been increasingly criticized. This article examines the implementation of managerialism in an attempt to evaluate its overall achievements and shortcomings. Overall, managerialism seems to have made good progress: managerial skills are improving; several management tools have been adapted to health-care and public-sector peculiarities; health-care organizations have adopted a wide range of technical solutions to fit their specific needs. At the same time, managerial innovations have often focused on structures as opposed to processes, on the way the organization looks as opposed to the way it works, on the tools it has as opposed to those it actually needs and uses. We thus suggest that research, training and policy-making should stop focusing on the technical features and theoretical virtues of specific tools and should redirect their emphasis on change management.

<p>Existing methods for data interpolation or backdating are either univariate or based on a very limited number of series, due to data and computing constraints that were binding until the recent past. Nowadays large datasets are readily available, and models with hundreds of parameters are easily estimated. We model these large datasets with a factor model, and develop an interpolation method that exploits the estimated factors as an efficient summary of all available information. The method is compared with existing standard approaches from a theoretical point of view, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, and also when applied to actual macroeconomic series. The results indicate that our method is rather robust to model misspecification, although traditional multivariate methods also work well while univariate approaches are systematically outperformed. When interpolated series are subsequently used in econometric analyses, biases can emerge, but they are smaller with multivariate approaches, including factor-based ones. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

<p>In this paper, we address a strategic planning problem for a three-stage production-distribution network.

The objective is to minimize the costs associated with production, transportation, and inventory as well as capacity expansion costs over a given time horizon. The limitations are the production capacities of the suppliers and producers, and transportation capacities of the corresponding transportation network. On the other hand, all capacities may be increased at a fixed cost. The problem is formulated as a 0-1 mixed integer programming model. Since the problem is intractable for real life cases efficient relaxation-based heuristics are considered to obtain a good feasible solution. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Many companies see key account management as a potentially successful way to implement a relational strategy. Nevertheless, the literature suggests that strategy implementation at the sales force level is difficult to achieve, mainly because salespeople may not understand - nor accept what they are requested to do. Despite their relevance, behaviors of key account managers have poorly been investigated. This article defines and tests a model of relational selling behaviors from the part of key account managers. Results show that the perception of the adoption of a relational selling strategy is associated with some specific key account managers' behaviors (customer-oriented selling, adaptive selling and team selling), but not with others (organizational citizenship behaviors). These findings suggest that potential discrepancies can exist between a relational selling strategy and its implementation at the key account manager level. Based on these results, theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>There is consensus in the marketing literature that market knowledge and cross-functional collaboration are two fundamental resources for successful product innovation. However, few studies examine the dimensions or characteristics of market knowledge and how and why these resources influence product innovation performance. Drawing on contingency theory and the knowledge-based view of the firm, the authors argue that knowledge integration mechanisms may account for the effects of market knowledge dimensions (i.e., breadth, depth, tacitness, and specificity) and cross-functional collaboration on product innovation performance. They find that market knowledge specificity and cross-functional collaboration affect product innovation performance through knowledge integration mechanisms. In contrast, whereas the effect of market knowledge depth is partially mediated, market knowledge breadth has a direct, unmediated effect on product innovation performance. A test of an alternative moderating perspective shows that the effects of market knowledge depth and cross-functional collaboration on product innovation are negatively moderated by knowledge integration mechanisms. By showing the differential effects of market knowledge dimensions on product innovation performance, the authors provide a more refined understanding of the interplay among market knowledge, its integration, and the firm's performance in product innovation. The authors also conclude that by overlooking the role of knowledge integration mechanisms, previous research may have provided an overly optimistic view of the value of cross-functional collaboration in product innovation.</p>"

<p>Academic research has demonstrated that sound marketing capabilities allow a firm to create superior customer value. Moreover, academic research and business practice have shown that Marketing and Sales departments are jointly responsible for marketing activities. Although scholars have devoted very limited attention to the relationship between these two departments, overlooking the role that poor alignment between the two has on the finn's capacity to generate superior customer value would be an error. The present paper proposes a model of antecedents to superior customer value creation elaborating on literature that deals with marketing capabilities and Marketing-Sales relationship. More specifically, the authors hypothesize that a firm's long-term strategic orientation, effective Marketing-Sales relationship, the use of a direct sales force and customer-oriented salespeople positively affect superior customer value creation and market performance. The empirical research confirms all hypotheses with the exception of the impact of a direct sales force. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Product development teams become increasingly dispersed because innovative project tasks require the input of specialized knowledge at multiple locations. Prior analyses indicate that as team member dispersion increases teams find it more difficult to perform high-quality teamwork. Moreover, the literature has largely assumed that the performance effect of teamwork in innovative projects would be driven by the nature of the project task and that this would be true regardless of the degree to which team members were co-located. The present study argues, however, that teamwork affects team performance more strongly as team member dispersion increases. Two main reasons for this are discussed: (1) High-quality teamwork can leverage the increased knowledge potential of dispersed teams; and (2) team leaders in more dispersed teams have little possibility to compensate low-quality teamwork through hands-on leadership. Responses from 575 managers, team leaders, and team members of 145 new product development (NPD) projects in the software industry were used to analyze the moderating effect of team member proximity on the relationship between teamwork quality and team performance. Using regression analysis, support is found for the initial hypothesis that team member dispersion moderates the relationship between teamwork quality and team performance, that is, that increasing team member dispersion increases the positive impact of teamwork quality on team performance. As such, the present analysis advances understanding of dispersed teams, showing that teamwork quality not only is more difficult to achieve but also is more critical to team performance as team dispersion increases. Furthermore, low-proximity teams can reach higher levels of effectiveness and efficiency than co-located ones if they manage to achieve high levels of teamwork over distance. Thus, team dispersion may well be an opportunity and should not just be regarded as a liability to be overcome or avoided. This research recognizes that the vast majority of teams are neither perfectly co-located nor perfectly virtual. There are many shades of gray between these two extremes, and various individual, team, task, and contextual characteristics may have an effect on how decreases-however small-in geographical proximity affect the process and performance of teams. Future research is encouraged to address such factors at different levels of analysis aimed at providing managers with recommendations for dispersed teamwork.</p>"

This trend has received considerable attention in the media, especially in combination with the emergence of new assisted reproductive technologies and levels of general fertility.

The validity of the aggregated approach is confirmed by out-of-sample forecasts and several simulation exercises. Several shocks are considered, and their implications for Euro area growth and inflation are examined. In particular, shocks to US growth, the nominal interest rate and the exchange rate of the Euro against the US dollar are discussed.

This paper explores the political economy reasons under this tax reform, mainly the attempt of the government to attract the uncertain voters (swing voters). A probabilistic voting model is introduced to capture the importance of swing voters. The model predicts that the average personal income tax rate tends to be lower for groups of lower income, higher preference for leisure and containing more politically mobile voters (swing voters). However, data from Italian polls show that, while the tax reform was a good strategy to attract swing voters, the specific design of the reform, which favored high-income and low-income individuals, but not the middle class, was not the more appropriate strategy.</p>"

Our study examines the governance and disclosure practices of the world's largest transnational firms. Using a unique dataset of 75 large firms in two time periods, 1995 and 2002, we examine both the governance practices, and disclosures regarding those governance practices, across Anglo-Saxon and non-Anglo-Saxon firms. Results indicate that non-Anglo-Saxon firms have developed their governance practices towards promoting an independent mechanism of control, namely a mechanism that is more similar to an Anglo-Saxon governance regime. In regard to governance-related disclosure practices, results indicate that for both Anglo-Saxon and non-Anglo-Saxon groups, disclosure practices have been evolving and converging towards more disclosures regarding governance matters.</p>"

<p>This article studies the association between social norms and the timing of leaving home. Although largely overlooked by most recent studies on leaving home, lift-course theory suggests that age norms and age grading influence life-course decisions in general and leaving home in particular. We use Fishbein and Ajzen's model of ""reasoned behavior"" to integrate this strand of research with the more individualistic view that dominates current thinking. Using data from a Dutch panel survey we use a Cox regression model with a control for sample selection to estimate the association between perceived age norms and the timing of leaving home. We show that perceived opinions of parents are associated with the actual timing of leaving the parental home but that societal norms and friends' norms concerning the timing of leaving home are not. In addition, the timing of leaving home is also associated with the perceived costs and benefits of leaving home and with the perceived housing market situation.</p>"

<p>This paper explores the relationship between two well-established concepts of measuring individual well-being: the concept of happiness, i.e. self-reported level of satisfaction with income, and relative deprivation, i.e. the gaps between the individual's income and the incomes of all individuals richer than him. Operationalizing both concepts using micro panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, we provide empirical evidence for subjective well-being depending more on relative deprivation than on absolute levels of income.

<p>This article has two objectives. It firstly provides a general framework for variables that influence R&D (Research and Development) localisation by pharmaceutical and biotech companies. The analysis of R&D localization includes both in-house R&D and contracted R&D. Following a systematic literature search, these variables were classified into four distinct categories: regulatory environment, institutional framework, national systems of innovation and local development and specialisation. The authors highlight that some of these factors directly depend on the action of public administrations (e.g., patent protection, price regulation, public investments in research, and incentives to private companies); others are indirectly influenced by public policies (e.g., GDP growth rate, infrastructures). This theoretical framework was used to analyse the Italian case-study. Pros and cons of the Italian context were investigated from the point of view of multinational pharmaceutical companies and the Italian Association of Biotech Companies. Interviews were chosen as the most appropriate data gathering technique given the exploratory nature of the study of the Italian context.</p>
<p>The paper is divided into five parts. A brief introduction provides figures showing that Europe has been loosing positions compared with other Continents and the same has occurred in Italy compared with other EU countries. The second one illustrates the methodology. The third one is focused on variables affecting R&D localisation. In the fourth section the Italian case-study is discussed. Theoretical and empirical findings are gummarised and discussed in the conclusions. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.</p>"

<p>The paper aims to identify those factors that cause changes in the speed and strength of the international transmission of output shocks from the USA to specified European economies. These factors are identified through the use of generalized impulse response functions conditioned on histories defined by an abrupt transition VAR.

Besides the identification of asymmetric responses, the proposed model is useful in analyzing the strong effect of the recent US recession on the European economies and changes in business cycle synchronization over time.

Similarly to the theoretical findings on the FDI-licensing trade-off, we show that the integrated solution is more likely to emerge when know-how easily spills over-i.e., when firms are endowed with more intangible assets or they belong to high-tech industries.

<p>Using Gioia and Brass' 1986 article, ""Teaching the TV Generation."" as a point of departure for considering our current instructional environment, we focus on a relatively recent development that once again has implications for our teaching pedagogies: that we are, in fact, no longer teaching a verbal, nor even just a visual, but now a virtual generation of students. Technological and social changes in the wider environment can have major implications for teaching and learning pedagogies-i.e., optimal teaching and learning occur when teaching styles align with learning styles. For that reason, we consider some key learning principles in light of the learning styles of our current generation of students, who are quite facile with virtual technologies. We argue that the effective use of some electronic learning tools can provide useful and engaging means for their education by addressing this generation's preferences for virtual media while also enabling student-directed interactivity (via online searches, games, simulations, etc.). We first articulate the conceptual grounds for arguing that there has been another shift in the teaching and learning environment we now face-which implies some necessary adaptation of traditional learning principles. We then discuss: (a) some technologies and applications (mainly Internet-based tools and videogames) that can facilitate the convergence between virtual generation (V-Gen) preferences and classroom interactions, (b) some guidelines for using these technologies to fulfil these learning principles and, (C) some pitfalls that can occur and how to avoid them.</p>"

<p>The adoption of information systems in healthcare is no less significant than in any other commercial or caring organisation. The literature on IS adoption in healthcare, makes it clear that the actors involved in the adoption process are almost universally seen as crucial, which matches our research results too. However, how such actors should be identified remains a topic for investigatory work since these are early days in achieving this. We derive and propose a structured method to model how actors might be identified: structured because such a rationale is explicable and such a method is more readily usable when transferred to others. Our structured method, named IGOHcaps, uses a static and then a dynamic step to pull out the individual, group, organisational and human determinants of the critical actors. In this process, the individual actors' differing views emerge which could enable decision- making bodies to produce more robust proposals if they incorporated some of the appropriate views. We discuss the application of IGOHcaps through a hospital case study. While a single case study cannot be a proof, the engagement of the actors was encouraging.</p>"

<p>Traditional descent systems can roughly be divided into patrilineal and matrilineal. In the latter, a man's heir is not his own child but rather his sister's son. The paper examines the implications of this social norm for the pattern of inter-vivos transfers using household level data from rural Ghana, where the largest ethnic group is traditionally matrilineal. In particular, it tests the predictions of a model of strategic behavior according to which children should respond to the threat of disinheritance by increasing transfers to their parents during lifetime to induce a donation of land before the default (matrilineal) inheritance is enforced. I find that the credibility of customary norms enforcement, as proxied by the presence of a nephew in the father's household, significantly increases the probability of receiving transfers from children for Akans but not for the other groups. The effect is specific to nephews and not to other co-resident boys. This pattern of behavior can affect asset accumulation decisions across generations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

<p>IBM discovered decades ago that adding programmers to a software project that was late did not help. Indeed, progress slowed even more. The ""resource-driven mindset,"" sometimes known as ""throw more money at the problem;' is limited, the authors argue. Yet this mindset has so dominated the research agenda that it has clouded our consideration of many situations in which scarce resources (precisely because they are scarce) are desirable, potentially leading to breakthrough performance. Resource constraints fuel innovation in two ways: through entrepreneurial, social-network approaches to securing the missing funds or the required personnel, and because teams often produce better results as a direct result of the constraints. The human mind is most productive when restricted, the authors maintain. Limited - or better focused - by specific rules and constraints, we are more likely to recognize an unexpected idea. Witness the outcome of a Cold War-era race between General Electric and BMW teams to design adequately cooled jet engines. The U.S. team had a virtual blank check, used the most advanced materials and spent nearly twice as much as the Manhattan Project did. The German team, which had significantly less funding at its disposal, came up with a simple yet elegant design principle that remains in use to this day.</p>"

<p>Several scholars have proposed personalization models based on product variety breadth and the intensity of customer-firm interaction with a focus on marketing strategies ranging from basic product versioning to customerization and reverse marketing. However, some studies have shown that the explosion of product variety may generate information overload. Moreover, customers are highly heterogeneous in willingness and ability to interact with firms in personalization processes. This often results in consumer confusion and wasteful investments. To address this problem, we propose a conceptual framework of e-customer profiling for interactive personalization by distinguishing content (that is, expected customer benefits) and process (that is, expected degree of interaction) issues. The framework focuses on four general dimensions suggested by previous research as significant drivers of online customer heterogeneity: VALUE, KNOWLEDGE, ORIENTATION, and RELATIONSHIP QUALITY. We also present a preliminary test of the framework and derive directions for customer relationship management and future research.</p>"

Scientists that are moving along applied research trajectories find it easier to produce industrial applications than their colleagues engaged in the quest for very fundamental understanding. We interpret our results by suggesting that, for the former, more academic research results in more exploitable results, hence in more chances to patent; for the latter, more academic research makes it just more unlikely that they will find the time to produce industrial applications.

<p>This paper analyzes the relevance of cost-based accounting in financial markets, focusing on the drawbacks associated with a move from cost- to price-based accounting. While the benefits of such a move are well known, much less attention has been given to the potential hidden costs. We explore such hidden costs looking at both companies and investors. From the point of view of insurance companies, we consider issues like the potential increase in earnings volatility and changes in the cost of capital. From the point of view of the final investor, we consider liquidity and expected returns, stressing the role of behavioral models. Our conclusion is that cost-based accounting is a useful addition to financial markets. It may stabilize short-run financial results and may improve the situation of investors with short horizons and loss aversion. It is certainly true that cost-based financial products are not fully transparent and leave to the asset manager large discretion in the determination of short-run returns. However, we believe that cancellation of cost-based financial products is not the right reaction to these drawbacks. Rather, we believe that regulation and monitoring is the best answer.</p>"

<p>Differently from prior studies that examine the role of stand-alone control systems within the relationship between owners and managers, our study investigates the correlation between two control mechanisms - voluntary disclosure and independent directors - in companies characterized by the presence of a dominant shareholder that is supposed to mitigate the classical agency problem. Based on agency theory, we hypothesize that the two mechanisms tend to coexist, since the presence of either one reduces the costs of introducing the other. Two further effects - the reputation and the domino effect - contribute to determine a positive relationship between the two mechanisms. We carried out the empirical analysis on 175 nonfinancial Italian listed companies, all controlled by a dominant shareholder. Voluntary disclosure is measured through three alternative disclosure indexes. Independent directors are identified not only according to a formal/legal definition, but also through stricter criteria. The empirical test is based on a multivariate analysis controlling for size, residual ownership diffusion, leverage, profitability and labour pressure. Results support our hypothesis and are robust to alternative criteria to identify dominant shareholders. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between different control mechanisms in particular agency settings.</p>"

<p>We present a dynamic comparative advantage model in which moderate reductions in import tariffs can generate sizable increases in trade volumes over time. A fall in tariffs has two effects. First, for given factor endowments, it raises the degree of specialisation, leading to a larger volume of trade in the short run. Second, it raises the factor price of each country's abundant factor, leading to diverging paths of relative factor endowments and a rising degree of specialisation. A simulation exercise shows that a fall in tariffs produces a disproportional increase in the trade share of output as in the data.</p>"

Agents different in age, income and in their ability to invest in the capital market vote on the degree of redistribution of the social security system and on the size of the transfer. In an economy with three income groups, a small Beveridgean system is supported by low-income agents, who gain from its redistributive feature, and high-income individuals, who seek to minimise their tax contribution and to invest in a private scheme.

<p>We study the rate of convergence of posterior distributions in density estimation problems for log-densities in periodic Sobolev classes characterized by a smoothness parameter p, The posterior expected density provides a nonparametric estimation procedure attaining the optimal minimax rate of convergence under Hellinger loss if the posterior distribution achieves the optimal rate over certain uniformity classes. A prior on the density class of interest is induced by a prior on the coefficients of the trigonometric series expansion of the log-density. We show that when p is known, the posterior distribution of a Gaussian prior achieves the optimal rate provided the prior variances die off sufficiently rapidly. For a mixture of normal distributions, the mixing weights on the dimension of the exponential family are assumed to be bounded below by an exponentially decreasing sequence. To avoid the use of infinite bases, we develop priors that cut off the series at a sample-size-dependent truncation point. When the degree of smoothness is unknown, a finite mixture of normal priors indexed by the smoothness parameter, which is also assigned a prior, produces the best rate. A rate-adaptive estimator is derived.</p>"

<p>Purpose - The ""brand community"" concept believes that the meaning of the brand transcends national boundaries. However, such an assumption presents challenges arising out of several reasons including co-existence of sub-tribes within a given brand community that allocate different meanings to a particular brand. This plurality of meanings seems exacerbated for global brands where meanings are shaped by tremendously varying cultures. Aims to address the issues.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - This text relies on a comparative study of the meanings attributed to one particular global brand, Warhammer, by the members of its brand community in France and the USA.</p>
<p>Findings - Findings highlight the elements of homogeneity and heterogeneity that reside in the cross-border meanings of the brand. The authors also discuss the marketplace relevance arising out of this plurality that should be taken into account by global marketers.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The present text argues that community attached to a global brand constitutes a complex phenomenon, one that both integrates and ignores geographical considerations.</p>"

<p>We compare the performance and risk of a sample of 181 large banks from 15 European countries over the 1999-2004 period and evaluate the impact of alternative ownership models, together with the degree of ownership concentration, on their profitability, cost efficiency and risk. Three main results emerge. First, after controlling for bank characteristics, country and time effects, mutual banks and government-owned banks exhibit a lower profitability than privately owned banks, in spite of their lower costs. Second, public sector banks have poorer loan quality and higher insolvency risk than other types of banks while mutual banks have better loan quality and lower asset risk than both private and public sector banks. Finally, while ownership concentration does not significantly affect a bank's profitability, a higher ownership concentration is associated with better loan quality, lower asset risk and lower insolvency risk. These differences, along with differences in asset composition and funding mix, indicate a different financial intermediation model for the different ownership forms. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

<p>The history of a number of industries is marked by a succession of eras, associated with different dominant technologies. Within any era, industry concentration tends to grow. Particular eras are broken by the introduction of a new technology which, while initially inferior to the established one in the prominent uses, has the potential to become competitive. In many case new entrants survive and grow, and the large established firms do not make the transition. In other cases, the established firms are able to switch over effectively, and compete in the new era. This paper explores a model which generates this pattern and has focused on the characteristics of the demand. We argue that the ability of the new firms exploring the new technology to survive long enough to get that technology effectively launched depends on the existence of fringe markets which the old technology does not serve well, or experimental users, or both. Established firms initially have little incentive to adopt the new technology, which initially is inferior to the technology they have mastered. New firms generally cannot survive in head-to-head conflict with established firms on the market well served by the latter. The new firms need to find a market that keeps them alive long enough so that they can develop the new technology to a point where it is competitive on the main market. Niche markets, or experimental users, can provide that space.</p>"

<p>This paper deals with the sensitivity analysis (SA) of inventory management models when uncertainty in the input parameters is given full consideration. We make use of Sobol' function and variance decomposition method for determining the most influential parameters on the model output. We first illustrate the method by means of an analytical example. We provide the expression of the global importance of demand, holding costs, order costs of the Harris economic order quantity (EOQ) formula. We then present the global SA of the inventory management model developed by Luciano and Peccati [1999. Capital structure and inventory management: the temporary sale problem. International Journal of Production Economics 59, 169-178] for the economic order quantity estimation in the context of the temporary sale problem. We show that by performing global SA in parallel to the modeling process an analyst derives insights not only on the EOQ structure when its expression is not analytically known, but also on the relevance of modeling choices, as the inclusion of financing policies and special orders.

<p>Purpose - The purpose of this article is to offer a view to non-Italian librarians on Italian document supply (DS) developments and to submit to Italian DS librarians some points for discussion and some problems to solve.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - Italian DS is described from the perspective of a large university library's interactions with its users (faculty, undergraduate students and researchers) and its suppliers (Italian and European libraries together with non-library suppliers). Some characteristics of Italian library systems can be better understood by referring to the historical context; other characteristics reflect the difficulty of considering DS services as a strategic service integrated with other services.</p>
<p>Findings - Italian DS services reveal two models of organisation and strategy, the networked and the independent.

<p>The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of trading Of CO2 emissions allowances on electricity pricing in the short run. We mainly refer to the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and are interested in understanding the role of electricity market structures. We carry out a simple analytical model useful to verify whether (and under which conditions) the impact of the ETS under market power could be lower (or higher) than that under perfect competition. We analyze a context where generators compete in a uniform, first price auction. Market power in the form of a dominant firm facing a competitive fringe model is assumed. The paper highlights that the marginal CO, opportunity costs are fully included in energy prices when the electricity market is perfectly competitive. Under market power the impact of the ETS equals or exceeds that under the competitive scenario only when there is excess capacity and the share of most polluting plants in the market is low enough. Otherwise, the impact under market power is less than under perfect competition and significantly decreases in the degree of market concentration. This especially occurs when there is not high excess capacity and regardless of either the plant mix or the allowance price. In this case, moreover, the marginal pass-through rate is lower in the peak than in the off-peak hours and can be even nil if the degree of market concentration is high enough. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>This paper aims to provide new measures of airline network configuration with a view to analyse effectively the complexity of modern carriers' network design. It studies network configurations in the airline sector by taking into account both spatial and temporal dimensions. The spatial dimension is measured by using both the Gini index and the Freeman index, which originate from social science research. The temporal dimension is measured by the connectivity ratio, i.e. the share of indirect connections over the total number of connections. According to these indicators, the configuration of the largest full-service carriers and the largest low-cost carriers in Europe is investigated. The results show that the temporal dimension provides a clear distinction between full-service carriers and low-cost carriers; while the spatial dimension appears useful when identifying the peculiarities within groups.</p>"

<p>Road pricing is becoming increasingly popular among decision-makers as a policy tool meant to rationalize transport flows in a given area. This paper aims to study modal choice as a function of the personal characteristics of commuters by considering an original data set of more than 9000 commuters in the Trento district of Italy which was collected in 2001. Empirical estimates of drivers' reaction to the introduction of road pricing and to the improvement of the quality of public transport services are provided. It was found that the introduction of a system of road pricing would be far more effective in reducing private car use than an improvement in the speed of public transport. It is also shown that road pricing should be carefully defined, as elderly people and families with children are among those with more inelastic private transport demand.</p>"

<p>In this article, we propose a competence-based view of value-for-customer in business markets. While literature in both strategy and marketing has provided many insights to understand the competence-based roots of value creation, the interface between the two areas is still largely unexplored. Moreover, while the notions of competence exchange and value creation feature strongly in the relational perspective, they occur only once relationships have been established. This begs the question whether competencies could be developed outside established relationships, and then marketed to guide customers' buying behavior. Basing on three case studies from the yam manufacturing, IT systems, and automotive components industries, we identify key features of competence-based marketing: the alignment of supplier's competencies with the customer's business processes, the experiential communication of supplier's competencies, and the delivery of competencies to the buyer's business processes. Within the strategies for creating value-for-customers, these findings contribute to the understanding of the use of competencies to induce purchases. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

<p>Board evaluations can contribute to effective boards and improved corporate financial performance. The increasing interest in the practice of board evaluations, however, calls for a more systematic and careful approach than has been employed in the past. While most attention has primarily been focused on the content of board evaluations, this article outlines the features of various possible board evaluation systems. Based on state-of-the-art research on boards and governance, we contend that a comprehensive board evaluation system needs to include decisions about: (a) the agent who evaluates the board; (b) the content, or what the evaluation should deal with; (c) the addressee and other stakeholders for whom the board is evaluated; and (d) how the board is evaluated. These key decisions should not be seen as independent of each other as they have consequences for the kind of system that will be adopted. Following this argument, we present four different board evaluation systems: G) board-to-board, (ii) board-to-market, (iii) market-to-board and (iv) market-to-market. The key message we communicate in this article is that there must be a fit between the purpose and the system of board evaluations. There is no universal or ""one best way"" to evaluate boards of directors. Board evaluations will not meet their purpose unless there is a fit between the agents, the addressees, the content and the modalities of the evaluation. It is important to know who is doing what for whom and how.</p>"

These results are reversed if the products are substitutes. Regardless of the correlation level, higher levels of substitutability reduce the value of the combined projects and increase the probability of investing.

<p>Background: There has been much innovation in primary care in the past few decades. Although external and systemic constraints for health care organizations are relevant for their managerial evolution, there is also evidence that organizations operating under the same external pressures reach different levels of maturity.</p>
<p>Purposes: Which of the internal drivers available explain and foster change? Is it possible to rank change drivers by looking at their rate of efficacy in order to define a general change management path in the relationship between managers and physicians? The study is a hypothesis-generating work, designed to discuss a framework, consistent with the complex adaptive systems literature, for effective internal change management approaches.</p>
<p>Methods: We employed a qualitative approach to conduct a multiple case study in order to directly observe the evidence and to ask ""key change players"" for their perceptions. We studied different organizations all subject to the same external constraints in order to focus on the effects of internal change drivers.</p>
<p>Findings: According to key players' opinions, the main drivers for managerial development are characteristics of the actors involved: their motivation, leadership, and commitment; the quality of relationships among the main actors; and how the resources dedicated to manage change are used. Given these criteria, any organizational strategy and goal seems to be achievable. This is consistent with the suggestions coming from the complex adaptive system literature.</p>
<p>Managerial Implications: Managers have to consider the management of the relationship with professionals as the key success factor for implementing change. Managerial leadership has to be diffused in the organization both in the vertical and horizontal dimensions. Innovations need a medium or long-term perspective to become widely applied, and this requires a strong commitment which is related to managerial stability. Resources for innovation are to be considered a critical driver for fostering the relationship between managers and professionals.</p>"

<p>Recent works [Epstein S, Rauzy A. Can we trust PRA? Reliab Eng Syst Safety 2005; 88:195-205] have questioned the validity of traditional fault tree/event tree (FTET) representation of probabilistic risk assessment problems. In spite of whether the risk model is solved through FTET or binary decision diagrams (BDDs), importance measures need to be calculated to provide risk managers with information on the risk/safety significance of system structures and components (SSCs). In this work, we discuss the computation of the Fussel-Vesely (FV), criticality, Birnbaum, risk achievement worth (RAW) and differential importance measure (DIM) for individual basic events, basic event groups and components. For individual basic events, we show that these importance measures are linked by simple relations and that this enables to compute basic event DIMs both for FTET and BDD codes without additional model runs. We then investigate whether/how importance measures can be extended to basic event groups and components. Findings show that the estimation of a group Birnbaum or criticality importance is not possible. On the other hand, we show that the DIM of a group or of a component is exactly equal to the sum of the DIMs of the corresponding basic events and can therefore be found with no additional model runs. The above findings hold for both the FTET and the BDD methods. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>The after-sales activities are nowadays acknowledged as a relevant source of revenue, profit and competitive advantage in most manufacturing industries. Top and middle management, therefore, should focus on the definition of a structured business performance measurement system for the after-sales business. In addition, since many actors are involved along the after-sale service supply chain, an integrated and multi-attribute set of measures needs to be designed consistently at every level of the supply chain. Nonetheless, little attention was devoted by scientific and managerial literature to this topic. The paper aims at filling this gap, and proposes an integrated framework for the after-sales network performance measurement, and provides an empirical application to two automotive case companies and their official service network. The cases show that performance measurement systems of different supply chain actors should be aligned in order to achieve strategic consistency. In particular, the performance of different actors at the process level of the framework concurs in determining the after-sales service overall performance towards the final customer. In addition, linkages at other levels (mainly the business and activity ones) may be needed or helpful in ensuring consistency between strategic and operational objectives, inside the organisations and thus for the whole supply chain.

<p>This article examines the growth strategies and ownership of the 40 largest corporations in Spain and Denmark from 1973 to 2003 in the light of European economic integration. It follows the tradition of the Harvard Program and builds on the work of Richard Whittington and Michael Mayers on the history of European corporations. These studies have been extended in three ways: geographically, introducing a small north European and a medium sized south European economy; methodologically by supplementing internationalization to diversification as main growth strategies; and chronologically by analysing three decades of corporate changes, 1973-2003. The result showed no convergence in diversification or ownership patterns while in both countries the largest corporations were less market oriented and more international at the end of the period.</p>"

<p>Acquisitions and mergers of equals often fail to deliver shareholder value, largely because poor integration practices do not allow synergies to be created. The issue has been addressed by several studies from two different research streams: the first looks at the combination of resources after the acquisitions and the second focuses on the human factor. We propose an integrated model where the effects of these key aspects are tested simultaneously and where three independent variables are included: the extent of planning and knowledge from previous acquisitions and knowledge from previous relationships. We believe that through the model managers can prioritise their actions and select an appropriate time horizon for the integration. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Aim. The aim of this study was to evaluate the economic impact of the introduction of positron emission tomography (PET) in the clinical management of patients with known or suspected lung cancer through a cost-effectiveness analysis of different diagnostic strategies.</p>
<p>Methods. In Italy, 75 patients with known or suspected lung cancer were included in the study. Three different diagnostic strategies were compared: 1) baseline or traditional strategy, i.e. computed tomography (CT) alone; 2) strategy A, ie. PET for indefinite CT; 3) strategy B, ie. PET for all. For each strategy expected costs and life expectancy, as measured by life year saved (LYS), were evaluated. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated to identify the most effective strategy.</p>
<p>Results. Compared to the baseline strategy, the introduction of PET changed the clinical management in 40% of cases in strategy A and in 51% of cases in strategy B, with an optimization of the clinical management. Costs of strategy A (2 735.42 is an element of) and strategy B (2 984-52 is an element of) were, respectively, 8% and 18% higher than the baseline strategy (2 534.81 is an element of). LYS was 2.04 and 2.64 for strategy A and B, which were, respectively, 4% and 35% higher than the baseline strategy (1.96 LYS). The ICERs were 2 507.63 is an element of/LYS and 415.17 is an element of/LYS for strategy A and B, respectively. Strategy A is dominated by strategy B, which is more expensive, but also more effective.</p>
<p>Conclusion. In Italy, the introduction of PET in the clinical management of all patients with known or suspected lung cancer previously evaluated with CT is cost-effective and allows to gain 2.64 life years at an annual cost of about 415 is an element of.</p>"

We derive pointwise rates of convergence for the posterior expected density by studying the speed at which the posterior mass accumulates on shrinking Hellinger neighbourhoods of the sampling density. If the data are sampled from a strictly positive, alpha-Holderian density, with alpha is an element of (0,1], then the optimal convergence rate n(-alpha/(2 alpha+1)) is obtained up to a logarithmic factor. Smoothing histograms by polygons, a continuous piecewise linear estimator is obtained that for twice continuously differentiable, strictly positive densities satisfying boundary conditions attains a rate comparable up to a logarithmic factor to the convergence rate n(-4/5) for integrated mean squared error of kernel type density estimators.</p>"

<p>Recent developments in international trade theory predict that increased globalization will be associated with increased locational concentration of economic activities, and hence increased specialization of national and regional economies. Relatively little empirical evidence exists about whether these predictions are correct, especially as regards Central and Eastern Europe. The paper analyses the interplay between economic integration and industry location in four candidate countries during the 1990s. It demonstrates that economic integration with the European Union has changed industry re-location processes within candidate countries, giving rise to a spatial organization of manufacturing productions which is less inward-oriented and more evenly distributed across regions than it was at the beginning of the transition process.</p>"

In particular, gratitude but not happiness, predicts repurchase intention and positive word of mouth. By contrast, guilt inhibits complaint behaviors and negative word of mouth. The implications of these findings for marketing practice are discussed. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"

<p>This paper introduces the theme of this Special Issue, that brings together some of the most significant papers presented at the 2006 Industrial Marketing & Purchasing (IMP) Group Conference. By proposing ""opening the network"" as the conference theme, our ambition was to provide a forum for new perspectives, alternative research methods and new empirical contexts, and so help IMP scholarship to continue evolving. After some preliminary remarks, we briefly introduce the papers and their contribution to the theme of this Special Issue. A first group of studies stimulates reflection in the field by contrasting IMP scholarship with ideas and points of view developed in related fields of inquiry. The second group, on the other band, may be seen as an endogenous development of IMP scholarship, while the third group represents a response to a critique often addressed at the markets-as-networks approach: its dearth of managerial relevance.

<p>Buyers and sellers interact in different ways.

<p>This article concentrates on the relationship between companies and their suppliers with a specific focus on the impact that information and communication technologies (ICTs) have on industrial (business to business) purchasing processes. After reviewing the extant literature, we classify the potential impact of ICTs on the buyer-supplier interactions into three main categories, i.e. impact on buyer-supplier relationship, impact on purchase process efficiency and impact on logistics process performance. Whilst scholars generally agree on the impact ICTs may have on buyer-supplier exchanges, they have not investigated concurrently all of these three impacts to understand their comparative relevance and the context in which this comparative relevance may change. In order to redress this gap in the literature our research study focuses on a particular form of ICT solution - supplier portals - and takes a supplier (rather than buyer) perspective. We explore empirical evidence from a single customer-multiple supplier case study, that of the Ferrari Auto supplier portal. Our study leads us to contend that suppliers view such portals as offering far more significant benefits to their relationship with customers than to the improvements in purchase process efficiency or to the performance of buyer-supplier logistics processes. We conclude with a short discussion of the main managerial implications and suggestions for future research. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>We study optimal Taylor-type interest rate rules in an economy with credit market imperfections. Our analysis builds on the agency cost framework of Carlstrom and Fuerst [1997. Agency costs, net worth and business fluctuations: a computable general equilibrium analysis. American Economic Review 87, 893-910], which we extend in two directions. First, we embed monopolistic competition and sticky prices. Second, we modify the stochastic structure of the model in order to generate a countercyclical premium on external finance. This is achieved by linking the mean distribution of investment opportunities faced by entrepreneurs to aggregate total factor productivity. We model monetary policy in terms of simple welfare-maximizing interest rate rules. We find that monetary policy should respond to increases in asset prices by lowering interest rates. However, when monetary policy responds strongly to inflation, the marginal welfare gain of responding to asset prices vanishes. Within the class of linear interest rate rules that we analyze, a strong anti-inflationary stance always attains the highest level of welfare. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Background: Amplification of the Her2neu oncogene is a well known indicator of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. The implementation into the clinical setting of therapeutical strategies directly targeting the Her2neu gene product, has create the need for the development of non-invasive analytical techniques in order to monitoring minimal residual disease and response to the treatment.</p>
<p>Methods: To detect the expression of Her2neu mRNA in peripheral blood, we developed a specific real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (QPCR) assay. The analyses were performed on blood samples obtained from 30 breast cancer patients positive for Her2neu overexpression by immunohistochemical analysis (IHC), 10 breast cancer patients negative for Her2neu overexpression, and 24 healthy controls.</p>
<p>Results: Her2neu positive tumors showed a significant increase in mRNA transcripts as compared with both healthy controls (n=24) and Her2neu negative patients (n=10). After establishing a cut-off value, 18 out of the 30 Her2neu positive patient scored positive for Her2neu expression, whereas only 1 out of the 10 Her2neu negative patients was weakly positive.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Her2neu QPCR is suitable method for Her2neu overexpression detection in peripheral blood from clinical samples of breast cancer patients. QPCR could be used to identify breast cancer patients with poor prognosis and for monitoring response to the therapy. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Employment, union formation and childbearing are central processes within young individuals' transition to adulthood. These processes interact in highly complex ways, and they shape actual life-course trajectories that may be seen as a conceptual unit. In this article we use a methodology to cluster life-course experiences, where all three processes are embedded explicitly, in order to study young women's trajectories in Great Britain. Drawing on a sample from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), we define life-courses as sequences on a monthly time scale and we apply optimal matching analysis to compute dissimilarities between individuals. We then use standard clustering algorithms and we identify nine distinctive groups of women. Our results are then shown using a new representation of clusters and interpreted in the light of the existing socio-demographic literature on the dynamic work-family link.</p>"

<p>Credit rating is the evaluation of the likelihood of an obligor to default on a loan. Each obligor in the bank's credit portfolio is assigned to a certain rating class, or PD (probability of default) bucket; all obligors in a PD bucket then receive the same ''pooled'' PD, based on which a capital charge against credit risk must be computed. The only analytical approach to this problem is based on k-means and has some limitations in practice. An error minimization approach to credit rating using differential evolution (DE) is introduced. The performances of DE and other common search heuristics are compared using credit rating data of a major Italian bank. Empirical results show that DE is clearly superior compared to a genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), random search (RS) and two naive partitioning approaches. Moreover, the proposed approach obtained better results than k-means in much less runtime for a simplified instance of the problem where within-groups variances can be used for clustering.

<p>Corporate management is torn between either focusing solely on the interests of stockholders (the neo-classical view) or taking into account the interests of a wide spectrum of stakeholders (the stakeholder theory view). Of course, there need be no conflict where taking the wider view is also consistent with maximising stockholder wealth. In this paper, we examine the extent to which a conflict actually exists by examining the relationship between a company's positive (strengths) and negative (concerns) corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities and equity performance. In general, we find little evidence to suggest that managers taking a wider stakeholder perspective will jeopardise the interest of its stockholders. However, our findings do suggest that the market is not only influenced by the independent CSR activities, but also the totality of these activities and that the facets that they value do vary over time. It seems that most recently, the market has valued most firms that satisfied minimum requirements in the areas of diversity and environmental protection but were most proactive in the area of employee-relations.</p>"

<p>By using a sample of 793 inventors drawn from the PatVal-EU dataset, this paper explores three aspects of patent production at the individual inventor level: (1) the number of EPO patents that the inventors produce; (2) the average value of their inventions; (3) the production of the most valuable patents. By jointly estimating the three equations we find that the inventors' level of education, employment in a large firm, and involvement in large-scale research projects positively correlate with quantity. Yet, apart from the size of the research project, none of these factors directly influence the expected value of the inventions. They do, however, have an indirect influence, as we find that the number of patents explains the probability of producing a technological hit (the maximum value). Also, there is no regression to the mean in the invention process at an individual level, as the number of inventions that an inventor produces is not correlated with the average value.

<p>By using the PatVal-EU dataset we find that the most important determinant of patent licensing is firm size. Patent breadth, value, protection, and other factors suggested by the literature also have an impact, but not as important. In addition, most of these factors affect the willingness to license, but not whether a license actually takes place. We discuss why this suggests that there are transaction costs in the markets for technology. The issue is important because many potential licenses are not licensed suggesting that the markets for technology can be larger, with implied economic benefits. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

<p>Customer satisfaction has long been considered a milestone in the path towards company profitability. Although it is widely acknowledged that customer satisfaction leads to higher and more stable revenues, the relationship between customer satisfaction levels and the costs that the company incurs in producing and delivering customer services has received far less attention, and the research results vary significantly across sectors. In fact, there seems to be little guidance for linking company costs to the key elements involved in providing customer satisfaction in services, thereby diminishing the ability of a company to manage its activities accordingly. In this paper, we propose and test a framework to analyse and manage the relationship between company costs and customer satisfaction in service industries. Based on a case study from the tourism industry, we show how service components can be used as a key medium to link customer satisfaction to the cost of service production and delivery. In doing so, we provide guidance for identifying specific sources of customer satisfaction and assessing their cost, thereby extending to service industries previous research on strategic cost management.</p>"

<p>Firm-level data sets on foreign manufacturing plants in four Central and Eastern European Countries are used in this paper, to trace their location and estimate the determinants of their choice processes. A nested logit model as developed by McFadden (1974) is used in the analysis. A central focus of the analysis is foreign direct investment (FDI) which is a good indicator of where location of foreign investments is made. Several reasons explain the need for mapping the location of FDI. First of all, it facilitates understanding the real competitiveness of regions and countries in providing location advantages able to complement multi-national enterprises' (MNE) specific advantages. Secondly, it directly shows the distribution of the benefits usually associated with FDI. Finally, an understanding of FDI location decisions is important for policy makers who believe that MNEs may offer a positive contribution to the economic development of disadvantaged areas and thus correct potential regional imbalances. The main results show that sector specific factors affect the choice of the final location. These unobserved characteristics influence both the determinants and the structure of MNEs location choice process.</p>"

<p>We present a theoretical model of a parliamentary democracy where electoral competition inside coalition governments induces higher spending than under single party governments. Policy preferences of parties are endogenous and derived from opportunistic reelection motives. The electoral rule affects government spending, but only indirectly: proportional elections induce a more fragmented party system and a larger incidence of coalition governments than do majoritarian elections. Empirical evidence from post-war parliamentary democracies strongly supports these predictions.</p>"

<p>Renewed interest in precursor analysis has shown that the evaluation of near misses is an interdisciplinary effort, fundamental within the life of an organization for reducing operational risks and enabling accident prevention. The practice of precursor analysis has been a part of nuclear power plant regulation in the United States for over 25 years. During this time, the models used in the analysis have evolved from simple risk equations to quite complex probabilistic risk assessments. But, one item that has remained constant over this time is that the focus of the analysis has been on modeling the scenario using the risk model (regardless of the model sophistication) and then using the results of the model to determine the severity of the precursor incident. We believe that evaluating precursors in this fashion could be a shortcoming since decision making during the incident is not formally investigated. Consequently, we present the idea for an evaluation procedure that enables one to integrate current practice with the evaluation of decisions made during the precursor event. The methodology borrows from technologies both in the risk analysis and the decision analysis realms. We demonstrate this new methodology via an evaluation of a U.S. precursor incident. Specifically, the course of the incident is represented by the integration of a probabilistic risk assessment model (i.e., the risk analysis tool) with an influence diagram and the corresponding decision tree (i.e., the decision analysis tools). The results and insights from the application of this new methodology are discussed.</p>"

<p>The Generations and Gender Survey (GGS) is one of the two pillars of the Generations and Gender Programme designed to improve understanding of demographic and social development and of the factors that influence these developments. This article describes how the theoretical perspectives applied in the survey, the survey design and the questionnaire are related to this objective.</p>
<p>The key features of the survey include panel design, multidisciplinarity, comparability, context-sensitivity, inter-generational and gender relationships. The survey applies the life course approach, focussing on the processes of childbearing, partnership dynamics, home leaving, and retiring. The selection of topics for data collection mainly follows the criterion of theoretically grounded relevance to explaining one or more of the mentioned processes. A large portion of the survey deals with economic aspects of life, such as economic activity, income, and economic well-being; a comparably large section is devoted to values and attitudes. Other domains covered by the survey include gender relationships, household composition and housing, residential mobility, social networks and private transfers, education, health, and public transfers. The third chapter of the article describes the motivations for their inclusion.</p>
<p>The GGS questionnaire is designed for a face-to-face interview. It includes the core that each participating country needs to implement in full, and four optional submodules on nationality and ethnicity, on previous partners, on intentions of breaking up, and on housing, respectively. The participating countries are encouraged to include also the optional sub-modules to facilitate comparative research on these topics.</p>"

<p>Neoclassical economists have advocated the use of pricing instruments as a fundamental tool for achieving sustainability of water systems and an efficient allocation of water resources. This idea has been accepted in worldwide agreed definitions of sustainability, where ""full-cost recovery"" is considered as a basic requirement. In this paper, we argue that water pricing (aiming at allocative objectives) and cost recovery can often be at odds, while prevalence of one or the other objective also depends on whether the main issue at stake is financing infrastructure development and maintenance, or rather allocating scarce water resources. Therefore, the two issues should be dealt with separately and require different approaches to pricing.</p>"

<p>Internationally expanding companies would like to see how they compare with rivals in terms of the effect of internationalization on financial performance (for their sector and their firm). Virtually all such studies have focused on advanced nations. This study, on internationalization of firms based in an emerging economy (India), provides a unique research setting and sheds additional light on this relationship. It tests for the shape of the internationalization-performance curve for emerging market firms, and investigates differences between service firms and manufacturers in the threshold effect between the initial and later stages of internationalization. We find a U-shaped curve depicting the internationalization-performance relationship of Indian firms. Service sector firms tend to gain the positive benefits of internationalization sooner than manufacturing companies. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>While in a steady state framework the choice between the wacc approach (Modigliani-Miller, 1963) and the adjusted present value (APV) approach (Myers, 1974) is irrelevant since the two approaches provide the same result, however, in a growing firm context the wacc equation seems to be inconsistent with the APV result. In this paper we propose a simple model to evaluate the tax savings in a growing firm in order to show under which assumptions the two approaches lead to the same results. We demonstrate that the use of the wacc model in a steady-growth scenario gives rise to some unusual assumptions with regard to the discount rates to be used in calculating tax shields. We show that the widely used wacc formula, if used, as it is in most cases, in a growth context, implies that a) debt tax shield related to already existing debt are discounted using k(d); b) debt tax shield related to new debt, due to company's growth, are discounted, according to a mixed procedure, using both k(u) and k(d). We discuss the inconsistency of such a discounting procedure and the preferred features of the APV approach.</p>"

In a cost-benefit analysis framework, the definition of the social discount rate is key to the selection of projects and programmes on the basis of their socio-economic return. To this extent, the Italian Ministry of the Economy has passively adopted the 5% rate proposed by the European Commission to evaluate projects financed by Structural Funds. In this article, we estimate a social discount rate for Italy, finding that a 3.7-3.8 rate would be appropriate, thus 1.2-1.3% lower than the official one.</p>"

Understanding why they start, how they operate, how they interact with the context - institutions, political actors, bureaucrats' behaviour and beliefs - and what role is played by individual policy entrepreneurs needs to be further examined. This paper addresses these questions by analysing recent experiences of E-Government policy in Italy from an institutional processualist approach. It does so in a country where such a complex Programme came into existence and became a mainstay of the modernization issue despite a tumultuous political context.</p>"

<p>The aim of this paper is to extend the theoretical literature on knowledge and network structure by studying the use of social networks as a learning mechanism. The novelty of this approach is suggested by the empirical evidence on informal trading of know-how. In the model, we consider a set of actors who create and diffuse knowledge with the aim of increasing their own personal knowledge. They are located on a lattice (identifying the social space) and are directly connected to a small number of other individuals. We assume that individuals can learn individually or socially, and that individuals choose how to learn on the basis of a cost-benefit comparison. Within this framework, we compare network structures in terms of efficiency and equity. We find that the opportunity cost of using the network affects its optimal structure in terms of aggregate performance and that the small world does not emerge unambiguously as being the most efficient.</p>"

<p>The spread of semi-autonomous organizations for the execution of public functions has attracted academic interest. There seem to be two main research agendas, one investigating broad issues of autonomy and control of Non-Departmental Public Bodies, another one focused on the narrower phenomenon of executive agencies. Especially the latter may benefit from the operationalization of commonly used concepts like: disaggregation, autonomy and re-regulation, contractualism. The article adopts an analytical framework based on these concepts to investigate executive agencies in Italy. Findings of interest for the international scholarly debate include: the limitations to the consideration of contractualism as an autonomous unit of analysis; the influence of the politico-administrative context on the actual utilization of performance contracting; the (apparently limited) role of re-regulation, and its sensitivity to the context; the importance of considering a wide range of factors in a combined way in explaining agency form; the consideration that 'modern' agencies are varied and not standardized solutions; the limitations that apply to the use of the socalled 'tripod' model of agency.</p>"

<p>The number of cataract extractions has increased substantially over time. At present, cataract surgery is estimated to be the most common single procedure performed in the developed world. The present study compares the costs of a cataract intervention across nine European countries. To enhance comparability, data were collected using a common template based on a case vignette. Adequate data for analysis were collected from 41 providers and were used to evaluate variation across countries and providers. Ordinary least squares and a multilevel model were used to investigate cost variation. Mean total costs per cataract intervention varied considerably from country to country, ranging from (sic)318 in Hungary to (sic)1087 in Italy. Variations of a similar magnitude were detected for personnel costs and overheads. However, variations in the cost of the lens were more modest. Overall, our results confirm expectations about the causes of cost variations across EU member states, indicating that these variations may be attributable to the quantity of resources used in performing the operation, the price of resources, and the type of setting in which the operation is performed. The study highlights how accounting practices and available cost data differ across Europe. It also shows the feasibility of collecting data on the basis of vignettes using common cost templates. Studies following this approach will gain importance if cross-country comparisons are to be used to promote European benchmarking exercises. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>Pharmaceutical policy in Italy has been reshaped as a result of the 1993-4 crisis in which it was revealed that pharmaceutical companies, policy makers and top Department of Health officers had constructed an illegal system to set prices. Following this crisis, the rise of technical competency and leadership in the Italian Department of Health and, since 2000, in the Drug Regulatory Agency (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco; AIFA) has achieved major improvements in many aspects of Italian pharmaceutical policy. These improvements have included increased transparency of decision making, the use of evidence-based medicine principles for reimbursement and pricing, and the use of generic drugs to lower prices.</p>
<p>As a result of these changes,,pharmaceutical expenditure has been controlled, ani:I equity has in proved, mainly because co-payments have been reduced, thus reducing private expenditure on reimbursable:drugs. However, a short-term approach to cost containment has prevailed, and Italian pharmaceutical policy has neglected industrial parameters. Hence, the trend in pharmaceutical expenditure has been erratic, and Italy has not favoured localization of research and development and production in its territory.</p>
<p>The dominant issue of Italian health policy in recent years has been devolution of powers to regions, the intermediate tier of the Italian State. Overall, devolution has increased regional accountability on healthcare spending. However, regions react to enhanced freedom in different ways, reflecting their institutional capacity and competencies. This process has also affected pharmaceutical policy, more than in other decentralized healthcare systems (such as Germany and Spain). Such a situation is causing increasing regional variations and geographical equity concerns. In addition, the regional level appears rather inadequate to promote an industrial perspective unless it is supported by national initiatives.</p>"

<p>Companies have vigorously pursued opportunities for profitability and growth through international venturing. Yet, research evidence on the performance benefits of international venturing activities has been contradictory. Applying an organizational learning framework, we propose that the expected effects of international venturing activities on financial performance depend on companies' absorptive capacity. Data from 217 global manufacturing companies show that absorptive capacity moderates the relationship between international venturing and firms' profitability and revenue growth. These results urge executives to build internal R&D and innovative capabilities in order to successfully exploit the new knowledge acquired from foreign markets. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

<p>Clinical Directorates (CDs), in the sense of ""intermediate organizational arrangements through which defined parts of larger hospitals health services are managed"", were introduced in the Italian National Health Service (INHS) by law after the major reform of 1992. By means of such reform, accountability chains within INHS hospitals were streamlined. Changes looked at strengthening the role of management in hospitals as a strategy to improve efficiency in the provision of services. From this stream of managerialism emerged the attempts to re-organize hospital activities along the lines of clinical directorates.</p>
<p>The aim of this paper is to outline the context in which CDs initially developed in Italy as the ""one best way"" to address current hospital problems and the reasons why they are now challenged due to not coming up to expectations. To do so we run through the last 10 years of history of CDs in Italy and propose an interpretative framework to understand the grounds for their partial failure and success.

<p>Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to question again the relevance of the differences, which were first discussed over 20 years ago, between industrial marketing and consumer marketing and to suggest new ways to frame the debate on the B2BC dichotomy.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - The paper includes an historical review of the principal texts of the industrial Marketing and Purchasing (IMP) group in order to elucidate the four key characteristics of industrial marketing; the time perspective, the role of the customer, market structure and the unit of analysis. It continues by considering the contributions that Consumer Culture Theory, which it is argued is a powerful renewing force in consumer marketing, can make in respect of these four characteristics.</p>
<p>Findings - The dichotomy of B2B/B2C no longer works by simply attributing it to the four historical differentiators of industrial marketing that are currently being adopted by innovators in consumer marketing. Consequently, this paper highlights the possible contributions of this development to industrial marketing and questions whether differentiation is possible. Are there not other criteria to take into consideration to differentiate the two fields?</p>
<p>Originality/value - This paper allows the reader to revisit a controversy that has apparently been kept hidden. It does not question the relevance of the controversy but the criteria used in trying to differentiate industrial marketing from consumer marketing.

<p>While human resource (HR) activities have traditionally been performed internally, the outsourcing of HR practices is a rapidly increasing phenomenon. The accelerated rate of HR outsourcing also corresponds to a sweeping change in which non-transactional activities, such as recruitment, selection and training, are among the most outsourced HR practices. This article investigates the outsourcing decisions of recruiting and selection (RS). It develops a predictive model based on efficiency drivers, rooted in transaction cost economy (TCE), and competitive motivations, derived from the resource-based view. The model has been tested in a sample of 276 medium and large enterprises in two specific contexts: the outsourcing of administrative RS practices (job advertisement and pre-screening) and that of the more strategic RS practices (colloquia and selection). Findings confirm the relevance of both categories of predictors, but they reveal how efficiency motivations are more important for the decisions to outsource administrative RS practices while competitive issues matter more for the strategic side of RS activity. Theoretical and managerial implications are offered on the basis of such evidence.</p>"

<p>Purpose - This paper seeks to adopt a resource-based approach to investigate the link between procurement capabilities, internet resources, and performance. It aims to cover two gaps in the operations management literature: the missing links between procurement capabilities and the performance of a firm, and the role of internet resources in shaping such links.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - After the identification of two key capabilities in procurement and the introduction of internet resources, the relationships with performance are empirically tested in a sample of 93 firms in the textile and clothing industry in Italy. Data were analysed using a partial least-squares technique and main and interaction effects were investigated.</p>
<p>Findings - First, process efficiency and process integration capabilities provide a significant (and equally important) contribution to firm performance, but there are no complementary effects between them. Second, and contrary to expectations, the internet has been found to enhance the effect of process integration capability, but not that of process efficiency capability. Third, a new finding reveals that the internet not only interacts with each of these capabilities in procurement separately, but it also enhances the synergistic effect between them.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - The investigation is based on a self-reported cross-sectional analysis, and it is specific to a single industry and the procurement of one type of material. Nonetheless, it suggests a number of different implications. Achieving excellence in procurement requires the development of distinct capabilities, because the management of core purchasing activities and the integration of procurement in the supply chain are not complementary. Contrary to common expectations, employing the internet in procurement has little power to reduce transaction costs, although it can be fruitful for improving inter-functional coordination. The internet can also help in ""putting the pieces together"" by exploiting the otherwise latent complementary effects between procurement capabilities.</p>
<p>Originality/value - This paper is unique in that it employs a strategic management theory - the resource-based view - to unpack the mechanisms through which procurement activities contribute to performance. It represents a first response to the call for research into the use of such theoretical frameworks which has recently been made in the operations management literature. The paper also offers the first empirical test of how the internet interacts with existing capabilities in the procurement domain, providing clear guidance on how to exploit its often undervalued potential.</p>"

<p>Manuscript Type: Empirical</p>
<p>Research Question/Issue: Given the global diffusion and the relevance of codes of good governance, the aim of this article is to investigate if the main reason behind their proliferation in civil law countries is: (i) the determination to improve the efficiency of the national governance system; or (ii) the will to ""legitimize"" domestic companies in the global financial market without radically improving the governance practices.</p>
<p>Research Findings/Insights: We collected corporate governance codes developed worldwide at the end of 2005, and classified them according to the country's legal system (common or civil law). Then, we made a comparative analysis of the scope, coverage, and strictness of recommendations of the codes. We tested differences between common law and civil law countries using t-tests and probit models. Our findings suggest that the issuance of codes in civil law countries be prompted more by legitimation reasons than by the determination to improve the governance practices of national companies.</p>
<p>Theoretical/Academic Implications: The study contributes to enriching our knowledge on the process of reinvention characterizing the diffusion of new practices. Our results are consistent with a symbolic perspective on corporate governance, and support the view that diffusing practices are usually modified or ""reinvented"" by adopters.</p>
<p>Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results support the idea that the characteristics of the national corporate governance system and law explain the main differences among the coverage of codes. This conclusion indicates the existence of a strong interplay between hard and soft law.</p>"

<p>This study seeks to analyse the long-term sustainability of fiscal policy in Latvia. Using a methodology called Generational Accounting, the net tax burdens of different currently living generations are calculated. Using these generational accounts, the residual net tax burden of future generations is determined and it is determined that the current fiscal policy stance is not sustainable. The generational imbalance amounts to about 260% of GDP, which is near the European average. The necessary fiscal adjustments are relatively small, but still significant. An overall tax increase of 8.5% would be required to close the generational gap. Other policy options could be to decrease transfers by 17.5% or government consumption by 25.0%. Alternative scenarios all lead to significant generational imbalances as well. On the other hand, a number of factors not included in this study may aid Latvia in achieving generational fairness and long-term fiscal sustainability.</p>"

<p>This paper adopts a system-evolutionary perspective to describe the dynamics of the life science sector and reflect on regional innovation policy. It begins with a brief outline of the evolution of life sciences and of the biotechnology industry. A crucial feature of such evolution is the strong tendency towards geographical concentration of research and related economic activities. The formation and growth of bio-clusters have sometimes appeared to be spontaneous, in that governments have not been in the driving seat. However, many regional and national governments have now developed policy frameworks to support the development of bio-clusters. Regional and evolutionary economics contribute to explain cluster emergence and growth, but little is known about pre-emergence conditions. As a result, although policy measures aimed at supporting emergence and growth are grounded on direct evidence and observable transformations, starting clusters from scratch often involves replicating the pathways followed by successful regions. We examine the rational behind regional innovation policy in life sciences and the reasons why some policies have either succeeded or failed. Special emphasis is placed on Scotland, where the local development agency has pioneered the implementation of cluster thinking to support the development of the life sciences sector.</p>"

<p>Within the evergreen debate ""competition law versus intellectual property law"" there is also room for the analysis of new and controversial tools such as Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems' as they do seem to affect competition for better or worse. As a matter of fact, the adoption of DRM systems has been spreading, and they are currently implemented in an increasing number of sectors. This phenomenon has consequences on competition within traditional markets as well as in the creation of new markets. The question thus arises as to whether the interface between DRM systems and competition enlarges the competition versus intellectual property debate or can be easily explored within those boundaries. In other words, if DRM systems are considered the extension of intellectual property rights (IPRs), they raise the same problems of ascertaining the IPR impact on competition. This is evident either when DRM systems are considered instruments to protect and distribute (therefore regulate access to) digital contents,3 or when they are adopted to regulate interoperability between complementary goods. Like IPRs, in both cases they pose the question of analysing the intersection with competition law in order to discover whether new elements to this intersection have been added.</p>"

<p>Within the framework of models for human-driven environmental impact based on the IPAT equation, we develop a model for the evolution of impact (expressed in terms of carbon dioxide emissions) and for the valuation of the economic cost associated to its reduction. We use a stochastic representation of the IPAT equation that is alternative to the STIRPAT model. This first step leads to a stochastic differential equations model that describes trends in carbon dioxide emissions on the basis of economic and demographic dynamics. As an example, we estimate the model parameters for the United States. We then use this framework to build a model for the assessment of the economic costs related to a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions for a country committed to respect an international agreement, such as the Kyoto protocol. In particular, we show that the adherence to an environmental treaty may be traced back to a problem of cost valuation and to a decision under risk. This allows us to use the mathematical tools that have been developed in quantitative finance, in the context of option pricing, to determine the expected investment that is required to reduce the emissions of a country by a certain amount and within a well-defined temporal frame.</p>"

<p>This paper explores the role of the heterogeneity of fiscal preferences in the assignment of policy tasks to different levels of government (decentralisation versus centralisation). With reference to a sample of European countries, a median-voter mechanism of collective decision is assumed to work at both a national and a supranational level. Using data from a large international survey (the International Social Survey Programme, ISSP), a series of econometric models are estimated in order to make individual attitudes representative of different categories of public expenditure and of different countries. The dominance of decentralisation over centralisation or vice versa is determined on the basis of the utility loss that each individual suffers in connection with the distance between his or her own most preferred level of public expenditure and that chosen by the national/supranational median voter. The main finding is that, differently from the predictions of Oates's decentralisation theorem, the assignment of responsibilities at the supranational level (centralisation) for a number of public expenditure programmes (healthcare, education, unemployment benefits) dominates (or is close to dominating) decentralisation, even in the absence of economies of scale and interregional spillovers. However, when the possibility of interjurisdictional mobility is explicitly considered, in line with the predictions of Tiebout's model, decentralisation dominance becomes more and more substantial and also prevails in the sectors where, under the nonmobility assumption, the assignment of responsibilities at the supranational level is efficient.</p>"

<p>In this article, we present a history-friendly model of the changing vertical scope of computer firms during the evolution of the computer and semiconductor industries. The model is history-friendly, in that it attempts at replicating some basic, stylized qualitative features of the evolution of vertical integration on the basis of the causal mechanisms and processes, which we believe can explain the history. These factors are identified in the coevolution of capabilities, the size of markets, and the structure of industries. In particular, the basic assumption is that the principal force behind the patterns of vertical integration and disintegration of computer firms was the differential development of capabilities for designing and producing semiconductors among firms. On this basis, the changing boundaries of firms are analyzed in the context of dynamic and uncertain technological and market environments, characterized by periods of technological revolutions punctuating periods of relative technological stability and smooth technical progress. The model illustrates how the patterns of vertical integration and specialization in the computer industry change as a function of the evolving levels and distribution of firms capabilities over time and how they depend on the coevolution of the upstream and downstream sectors. Specific conditions in each of these marketsthe size of the external market, the magnitude of the technological discontinuities, the lock-in effects in demandexert critical effects and feedbacks on market structure and on the vertical scope of firms as time goes by.</p>"

<p>One of the stylized facts of unfunded social security programs is that programs are larger in size, measured relative to the GDP, the tighter the link between pension claims and past earnings. We provide a political economy explanation of this stylized fact in a median voter model, where people vote on the social security tax rate. We compare pension systems with flat-rate and earnings-related benefit formulas. Only flat-rate benefits redistribute within a generation from high to low income groups. If labor supply is endogenous, they also imply larger efficiency costs than earnings-related schemes. Using data on eight European countries, we find that the median voter is typically middle-aged with high income. For these voters, earnings-related systems are more attractive both because of less intragenerational redistribution and lower distortions in labor supply. The median voter model is also able to account for a considerable degree of cross-country variation in contribution rates.</p>"

In all cases but one, an increased preference for robustness makes monetary policy respond more aggressively to cost shocks but leaves the response to demand shocks unchanged. As a consequence, inflation is less volatile and output is more volatile than under the nonrobust policy. Under one particular timing assumption, however, increasing the preference for robustness has no effect on the optimal targeting rule (nor on the economy).</p>"

The article analyses a recent strategy by EMI Music to use projects for organizing the launch of promising new releases onto the music market. Through an indepth qualitative analysis of two relevant cases, the article illustrates how projects assist in integrating marketing and creative people (and their knowledge) in a purposeful way, and disseminating the consequential learning across initiatives. Project forms in creative industries are able to combine different types of knowledge and align different purposes across launch functions by synchronizing sequential activities and establishing joint decision making rules. They can also improve knowledge retention and diffusion among sequential initiatives, by creating artefacts where knowledge can be stored and re-used in other launches, and by removing organizational disincentives to knowledge sharing.

<p>Mass customization (MC) constitutes a promising strategy for companies which aim to provide products which are better adapted to individual customers' aesthetic and functional preferences. Drawing on commodity theory, we argue that the perceived uniqueness of a self-designed product is a second driver of utility in MC. We find that in addition to the significant effect of aesthetic and functional fit, the perceived uniqueness of a self-designed product (1) contributes independently to the utility a customer experiences, and (2) that this effect is moderated by the consumer's need for uniqueness. In product categories which can serve this counterconformity motive for consumers, this suggests that MC toolkits should be constructed with the objective of facilitating the creation of unique products as well as providing affirmative feedback that this uniqueness has been achieved.</p>"

<p>For the welfare state the last 30 years have witnessed a turbulent transition from the 'Golden Age' of expansion to a 'Silver Age' of permanent austerity. This shaft has been the result of external pressures and of internal transformations of domestic economies and social structures. Permanent austerity has entailed incisive institutional adaptations and has been accompanied by a 'new politics', centred on a plurality of 'blame avoidance' strategies on the side of parties and governments. The article summarises and discusses the main factual developments since the mid-1970s but it also surveys the main strands of academic debates on both the expansion and the crisis phases. The author argues that comparative welfare state research has been one of the liveliest fields of political economy-a field marked by important analytical and theoretical advances and by the accumulation of relevant and systematic empirical knowledge about a key institution of the European political landscape.</p>"

<p>Assessing public sector ICT investments represents the premise for successful implementation of an e-health strategy. The recent literature stresses the importance of going beyond the mere financial and/or technical dimensions of the analysis. Consequently, the paper proposes an example of e-health project evaluation aiming to develop measures which get close to the notion of benefits to the different stakeholders involved: top management, patients, local community. The case study refers to an Italian health care organization that implemented a project of digitalization of its clinical reports production few years ago. Based on on-field research, different approaches are used to assess costs and benefits from different stakeholders' perspectives. The results of a multidimensional evaluation are reported to emphasize the need for different measures to assess the sustainability of an e-health project according to the financial convenience, the social role of the organization, and the contingent situation.

<p>This paper uses a novel dataset and research design to examine the effects of information networks on immigrants' access to health care. The dataset consists of an unusually large sample of undocumented immigrants and contains a direct indicator of information networks-whether an immigrant was referred to health care opportunities by a strong social tie (relative or friend). This measure allows to overcome some of the major identification issues that afflict most of the existing literature on network effects and to concentrate on one of the channels through which social contacts might operate. The analysis focuses on the time spent in Italy before an immigrant first receives medical assistance. Estimates indicate that networks significantly foster health care utilization: after controlling for all available individual characteristics and for ethnic heterogeneity, I find that relying on a strong social tie reduces the time to visit by 30%. The effect of information networks is stable across specifications and it is relatively large. Further investigation seems to confirm the quantitative importance of networks as an information device.

<p>How and why does distant political and economic history shape the functioning of current institutions? This paper argues that individual values and convictions about the scope of application of norms of good conduct provide the ""missing link."" Evidence from a variety of sources points to two main findings. First, individual values consistent with generalized (as opposed to limited) morality are widespread in societies that were ruled by non-despotic political institutions in the distant past. Second, well-functioning institutions are often observed in countries or regions where individual values are consistent with generalized morality, and under different identifying assumptions this suggests a causal effect from values to institutional outcomes.

<p>Based on structural VAR evidence for the U.S., we document that arise in government spending generates three facts: (1) an appreciation of the terms of trade; (2) a fall in the price of traded vs. non-traded goods (proxied by the price of goods relative to services), and (3) a positive co-movement between the manufacturing and the service sector, both in consumption and production. We show that, even if government spending is assumed to be as intensive in goods and services as households' consumption, the relative price behavior can be explained as a simple implication of trade openness. However, a baseline open-economy business-cycle model has problems in rationalizing simultaneously the sectoral co-movement of quantities and the behavior of relative prices. This anomaly is enhanced if government spending is assumed to be intensive in non-traded goods.</p>"

<p>We analyze optimal monetary policy in a small open economy characterized by home bias in consumption. Peculiar to our framework is the application of a Ramsey-type analysis to a model of the recent open-economy New Keynesian literature. We show that home bias in consumption is a sufficient condition for inducing the monetary policymaker of an open economy to deviate from a strategy of strict markup stabilization and contemplate some (optimal) degree of exchange rate stabilization. We focus on the optimal setting of policy both in the case of firms setting prices one period in advance and in a gradual fashion subject to adjustment costs. While the first setup allows us to analytically highlight home bias as an independent source of equilibrium markup variability, the second setup allows to study the effects of future expectations on the optimal policy problem and the effect of home bias on optimal inflation volatility. The latter, in particular, is shown to be related to the degree of trade openness in a U-shaped fashion, whereas exchange rate volatility is monotonically decreasing in openness.</p>"

<p>Lead users are found to come up with commercially attractive user innovations and have been shown to be a highly promising source of innovation for new product development tasks. According to lead-user theory, these users are defined as being ahead of an important market trend and experiencing high benefits from innovating. The present article extends lead-user theory by exploring the antecedents and consequences of consumers' lead userness in the course of three studies on extreme sports communities. Regarding antecedents, it uncovers that field-related variables (consumer knowledge and use experience) as well as field-independent personality variables (locus of control and innovativeness) help explain an individual's lead userness. These variables might therefore be used as a proxy to identify the rare species of lead users. With regard to consequences, it uncovers that lead users demonstrate innovative behavior not only by creating new product ideas but also by adopting new commercial products more heavily and faster than ordinary users. This highlights the idea that lead users might not only be valuable to idea-generation processes for radically new concepts; instead, they might also be relevant to more general issues in the marketing of new products.</p>"

<p>Background: In Tajikistan it is estimated that out of pocket payments constitute two-thirds of all health spending with high proportions of these contributions through informal payments. As a consequence, access to basic care is a major concern particularly among the most needy and vulnerable groups. This article evaluates accessibility of prescription medicines and patient expenditures for primary care services in two rural districts of Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Methods: 901 patients aged 18 years or above who had accessed primary care facilities were interviewed, using a questionnaire based on questions regarding patient's experience of visiting the health facility. To group respondents by socio-economic status, an asset index was created using principal component analysis of the information included in the questionnaires.</p>
<p>Results: 76.7% of patients were prescribed a medicine during the visits and more than 83% of them managed to obtain it. Patients spent on average US$ 9.3 on medicines, with wide variation among socio-economic groups. Around 45% of patients paid the Family Doctor. Additionally, over 41% of patients in the highest socioeconomic quintile were referred to a specialist, while only 29% of the poorest 40%. Conclusion: This survey showed that there are financial barriers potentially inactivating utilization of basic services. These barriers can only be reduced by mobilizing more public resources to fund the health sector, providing incentives for family doctors to stop requiring payments from patients, and increasing the availability of prescription drugs in PHC facilities.</p>"

<p>In this work, we introduce a generalized rationale for local sensitivity analysis (SA) methods that allows to solve the problems connected with input constraints. Several models in use in the risk analysis field are characterized by the presence of deterministic relationships among the input parameters. However, SA issues related to the presence of constraints have been mainly dealt with in a heuristic fashion. We start with a systematic analysis of the effects of constraints. The findings can be summarized in the following three effects. (i) Constraints make it impossible to vary one parameter while keeping all others fixed. (ii) The model output becomes insensitive to a parameter if a constraint is solved for that parameter. (iii) Sensitivity analysis results depend on which parameter is selected as dependent. The explanation of these effects is found by proposing a result that leads to a natural extension of the local SA rationale introduced in Helton (1993). We then extend the definitions of the Birnbaum, criticality, and the differential importance measures to the constrained case. In addition, a procedure is introduced that allows to obtain constrained sensitivity results at the same cost as in the absence of constraints. The application to a nonbinary event tree concludes the article, providing a numerical illustration of the above findings.</p>"

Young adults who LAT with parents are described and the determinants of LAT are analysed with reference to Italy. The relevance of this phenomenon is documented for Italy, a country with one of the highest share of young adults cohabiting with parents and with fundamental subnational differences both on higher education provision and in the labour market situation.

<p>For a very long time, Albania has had one of the highest levels of fertility in Europe: in 2002 the total fertility rate of 2.2 children per woman was the highest in Europe. Although this current level is high, the country has experienced a rapid fertility reduction during the last 50 years: a TFR decline from 7 to 2.2. This reduction has occurred in the absence of modern contraception and abortion, which indicates the significance of investments in the social agenda during the communist regime that produced policies with indirect effects on fertility. Most significant of these were policies focused on education, in particular on female education. Social and demographic settings for a further fertility reduction in Albania have been present since 1990. Contraception and abortion have been legalized and available since the early 1990s, but knowledge of their use is still not widespread in the country, largely due to the interplay between traditional and modern norms of Albanian society. This chapter points out that future fertility levels will be determined not only by new policies that might be introduced, but predominantly by the balance of this interplay.</p>"

Using data for over 2 million companies from around the world incorporating in the U.K., we find a large increase in cross-country incorporations from E.U. Member States following the ECJ rulings. In line with regulatory cost theories, incorporations are primarily driven by minimum capital requirements and setup costs in home countries.

<p>In this note the problem of nonparametric regression function estimation in a random design regression model with Gaussian errors is considered from the Bayesian perspective. It is assumed that the regression function belongs to a class of functions with a known degree of smoothness. A prior distribution on the given class can be induced by a prior on the coefficients in a series expansion of the regression function through an orthonormal system. The rate of convergence of the resulting posterior distribution is employed to provide a measure of the accuracy of the Bayesian estimation procedure defined by the posterior expected regression function. We show that the Bayes' estimator achieves the optimal minimax rate of convergence under mean integrated squared error over the involved class of regression functions, thus being comparable to other popular frequentist regression estimators.</p>"

To use these models for policy evaluation, the econometrician must estimate the parameters of expectation terms. Standard estimation methods have several drawbacks, including possible lack or weakness of identification of the parameters, misspecification of the model due to ornitted variables or parameter instability, and the common use of inefficient estimation methods. Several authors have raised concerns over the implications of using inappropriate instruments to achieve identification.

<p>Predicting the future evolution of GDP growth and inflation is a central concern in economics. Forecasts are typically produced either from economic theory-based models or from simple linear time series models. While a time series model can provide a reasonable benchmark to evaluate the value added of economic theory relative to the pure explanatory power of the past behavior of the variable, recent developments in time series analysis suggest that more sophisticated time series models could provide more serious benchmarks for economic models. In this paper we evaluate whether these complicated time series models can outperform standard linear models for forecasting GDP growth and inflation. We consider a large variety of models and evaluation criteria, using a bootstrap algorithm to evaluate the statistical significance of our results. Our main conclusion is that in general linear time series models can hardly be beaten if they are carefully specified. However, we also identify some important cases where the adoption of a more complicated benchmark can alter the conclusions of economic analyses about the driving forces of GDP growth and inflation.

<p>In this paper, we explore the effects of alternative policies, ranging from antitrust to public procurement, open standards, information diffusion and basic research support on the dynamics of two vertically related industries in changing and uncertain technological and market environments. The two industries are a system industry and a component industry, and the evolution of these industries is characterized by periods of technological revolutions punctuating periods of relative technological stability and smooth technical progress. We have been inspired by the co-evolution of the computer and component industries from their inceptions to the 1980s. On the basis of that evolution, we have developed a history friendly-model this co-evolution. In sum, this paper has stressed that various types of policies may sometimes have contrasting effects on the industry, mainly on concentration and technical change and innovation. It has also shown that the consequences of policies may spillover from one industry to another, and from one type of firms to another. Policies that aim at a specific industry may provoke major changes in a related industry through the product market, the changing boundaries of firms or knowledge and technological interdependencies. The policy maker has to be aware of that. Finally, a major point of the paper regards the unintended consequences of policies. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Recent research holds that new organizational forms emerge from the identity of candidate organizations that enter a domain. In this study we argue that emergence of a new form, which is ultimately based on validation by external audiences, depends on two mechanisms: identity framing, i. e., how audiences perceive and frame the identity of an emerging organizational domain, and identity matching, i. e., the match between the identity of the domain and the identity of candidates. Accordingly, form emergence is best characterized as contextual rather than as an inherent attribute of the categories of candidate organizations. Using data on the U. S. commercial television industry from 1940 to 1960, we explore how entry rates of TV stations were affected by audiences' expectations about the identity of the nascent domain and by the densities of organizations with different origins. We find evidence that focused expectations expressed through public discourse about media, and the number of stations coming from radio broadcasting increased entry rates. We reconcile our findings with existing theory on the emergence of organizational forms by pointing to the joint relevance of domain-related and candidate-related identities.</p>"

<p>Background: n-ELAV (neuronal-Embryonic Lethal, Abnormal Vision)-like genes belong to a family codifying for onconeural RNA-binding proteins. Anti-Hu-antibodies (anti-Hu-Ab) are typically associated with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis/ sensory neuropathy (PEM/PSN), and low titres of anti-Hu-Ab, were found in newly diagnosed Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC). The aim of this study is to develop a sensitive and quantitative molecular real-time PCR assay to detect SCLC cells in peripheral blood (PB) through nELAV-like transcripts quantification.</p>
<p>Methods: Peripheral blood samples from 25 SCLC untreated patients and 12 healthy blood donors were investigated by real-time PCR. mRNA levels for HuB (ELAV2), HuC (ELAV3) and HuD (ELAV4) were measured in peripheral blood samples with an absolute quantification method using plasmid dilutions as calibration curves.</p>
<p>Results: A statistically significant increase in mRNA expression level was detected for HuB and HuD in SCLC patients as compared with samples from healthy blood donors. After establishing cut off values based on the level of expression in control samples, 28% of the SCLC samples were positive for HuD expression. Overall 60% of the SCLC displayed increased level of HuD or HuB transcripts.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Our preliminary results suggest that neuron-ELAV mRNA are detectable in peripheral blood of SCLC patients using real-time quantitative PCR.</p>"

<p>Objectives: The study aims at evaluating the economic evidence related to testing for genetic variants of the drug-metabolizing enzyme, TPMT Detecting TPMT genetic variants before the administration of azathioprine (AZA) has the potential to prevent serious and costly adverse drug reactions (ADRs), such as neutropenia. In particular, our analysis concentrated on assessing the reliability of data on costs of neutropenia and performing the tests, the two main cost categories that could inform an economic evaluation of TPMT pharmacogenetic testing.</p>
<p>Methods: A systematic literature review was performed to gather evidence on the costs of testing and neutropenia. Articles were critically appraised for their comprehensiveness and quality. To better estimate costs of TPMT tests, a small-scale survey of European diagnostic laboratories was conducted.</p>
<p>Results: Only seven articles were retrieved specifying the costs associated with the management and treatment of AZA-induced neutropenia. Most of these studies are based on theoretical modeling reconstructed with key-informants or on very few cases of ADRs, and either the methodology for cost calculation is not specified or costs are based on national cost databases and tariffs. After critical appraisal of these studies, we considered epsilon 2,116 as the most reliable estimate for the cost of a case of neutropenia. Literature review accompanied by the survey of several diagnostic laboratories also provided an estimate (epsilon 68) for TPMT testing. Based on these values, the net cost per prevented case of neutropenia equals to epsilon 5,300.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Solid economic considerations related to TPMT pharmacogenetic testing are still limited by underreporting of ADRs and high level of approximation related to cost data. Ad hoc observational studies and the ADR recording process embedded in pharmacovigilance systems, established across Europe, should represent more reliable sources of cost data in the future.</p>"

<p>In this work, we study the effect of epistemic uncertainty in the ranking and categorization of elements of probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) models. We show that, while in a deterministic setting a PSA element belongs to a given category univocally, in the presence of epistemic uncertainty, a PSA element belongs to a given category only with a certain probability. We propose an approach to estimate these probabilities, showing that their knowledge allows to appreciate ""the sensitivity of component categorizations to uncertainties in the parameter values"" (U.S. NRC Regulatory Guide 1.174). We investigate the meaning and utilization of an assignment method based on the expected value of importance measures. We discuss the problem of evaluating changes in quality assurance, maintenance activities prioritization, etc. in the presence of epistemic uncertainty. We show that the inclusion of epistemic uncertainly in the evaluation makes it necessary to evaluate changes through their effect on PSA model parameters. We propose a categorization of parameters based on the Fussell-Vesely and differential importance (DIM) measures. In addition, issues in the calculation of the expected value of the joint importance measure are present when evaluating changes affecting groups of components. We illustrate that the problem can be solved using DIM. A numerical application to a case study concludes the work.</p>"

Demography directly affects the needs of consumers regarding the risks to be covered; the structure of liabilities is important due to the limited possibilities to hedge many of them; the securitization process has been less relevant for insurance companies than for other financial intermediaries; regulation is different and implemented by different authorities; accounting is usually carried out on a price basis in the banking sector and on a cost basis in the insurance sector; and distribution channels require different expertise.

<p>This article shows that buyers' coordination failures might prevent entry in an industry with an incumbent firm and a more efficient potential entrant. If there were a single buyer, or if all buyers formed a central purchasing agency, coordination failures would be avoided and efficient entry would always occur. More generally, exclusion is less likely the lower the number of buyers. For any given number of buyers, exclusion is less likely the more fiercely buyers compete in the downstream market. First, intense competition may prevent miscoordination equilibria from arising; second, in cases where miscoordination equilibria still exist, it lowers the maximum price that the incumbent can sustain at such exclusionary equilibria.</p>"

<p>In Italy, the process of power decentralization to Regional Governments has particularly affected pharmaceutical care policies. Regions are experimenting with various strategies to govern drugs utilization and expenditure, and differentiating their approaches. leading to an ever-changing and complex institutional scenario.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies have created new professional roles, the Regional Affairs Managers (RAM), with the mandate to monitor the different regional contexts and measures, and to establish relationships with the public actors in charge of pharmaceutical policies.</p>
<p>This analysis shows how public affairs/lobbying actions at regional level and the creation of a solid political competence within companies are still in an early phase. The activities carried out by RAMs remain limited to an exchange of information and only rarely are perceived by Regional public servants (RRs) as giving Support to their work or influence decisions.</p>
<p>The interaction with RAMs is often seen as little relevant and still too concentrated on products and a marketing/commercial approach rather than on broader issues of interest to RRs who need to manage the pharmaceutical care system at large. The level of acceptance of this type of activity is also variable and RRs' attitudes alternate between diffidence, polite tolerance, and openness to a constructive dialogue about pharmaceuticals and their management in a regional healthcare system.

<p>In this paper, the authors propose that the canonical customer-toolkit dyad in mass customization (MC) should be complemented with user communities. Many companies in various industries have begun to offer their customers the opportunity to design their own products online. The companies provide Web-based MC toolkits that allow customers who prefer individualized products to tailor items such as sneakers, personal computers (PCs), cars, kitchens, cereals, or skis to their specific preferences. Most existing MC toolkits are based on the underlying concept of an isolated, dyadic interaction process between the individual customer and the MC toolkit. Information from external sources is not provided. As a result, most academic research on MC toolkits has focused on this dyadic perspective. The main premise of this paper is that novice MC toolkit users in particular might largely benefit from information given by other customers. Pioneering research shows that customers in the computer gaming and digital music instruments industries are willing to support each other for the sake of efficient toolkit use (e.g., how certain toolkit functions work). Expanding on their work, the present paper provides evidence that peer assistance appears also extremely useful in the two other major phases of the customer's individual self-design process, namely, the development of an initial idea and the evaluation of a preliminary design solution. Two controlled experiments were conducted in which 191 subjects used an MC toolkit to design their own individual skis. The authors found that during the phase of developing an initial idea, having access to other users' designs as potential starting points stimulates the integration of existing solution chunks into the problem-solving process, which indicates more systematic problem-solving behavior. Peer customer input also turned out to have positive effects on the evaluation of preliminary design solutions. Providing other customers' opinions on interim design solutions stimulated favorable problem-solving behavior, namely, the integration of external feedback. The use of these two problem-solving heuristics in turn leads to an improved process outcome-that is, self-designed products that meet the preferences of the customers more effectively (measured in terms of perceived preference fit, purchase intention, and willingness to pay). These findings have important theoretical and managerial implications.</p>"

<p>Foreign direct investment in the service sector has been gaining importance in the past decade as more countries transform themselves into post-industrialised economies. The transition from a centrally planned economy to market-based economy has generated a surge of foreign direct investment from industrialised countries to Central and Eastern European Countries. This paper examines the impact of ownership and location factors on the extent of internalisation for service multinationals seeking to enter into the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, as these countries launch their economies towards increased privatisation, deregulation, and liberalisation. Using foreign direct investment data of 76 firms during 1990-2000, we find significant support for our main hypotheses.</p>"

<p>It is investigated whether euro area variables can be forecast better based on synthetic time series for the pre-euro period or by using just data from Germany for the pre-euro period. Our forecast comparison is based oil quarterly data for the period 1970Q1-2003Q4 for 10 macroeconomic variables. The years 2000-2003 are used as forecasting period. A range of different univariate forecasting methods is applied. Some of them are based on linear autoregressive models and we also use some nonlinear or time-varying coefficient models. It turns out that most variables which have a similar level for Germany and the euro area such as prices can be better predicted based on German data, while aggregated European data are preferable for forecasting variables which need considerable adjustments in their levels when joining German and European Monetary Union (EMU) data. These results suggest that for variables which have a similar level for Germany and the euro area it may be reasonable to consider the German pre-EMU data for studying economic problems in the euro area.

<p>We verify the existence of a relation between loss given default rate (LGDR) and macroeconomic conditions by examining 11,649 bank loans concerning the Italian market. Using both the univariate and multivariate analyses, we pinpoint diverse macroeconomic explanatory variables for LGDR on loans to households and SMEs. For households, LGDR is more sensitive to the default-to-loan ratio, the unemployment rate, and household consumption. For SMEs, LGDR is influenced by the total number of employed people and the GDP growth rate. These findings corroborate the Basel Committee's provision that LGDR quantification process must identify distinct downturn conditions for each supervisory asset class.</p>"

<p>We consider a sample of IT managers in SMEs in Italy and investigate what influences their evaluation of the objectives of, the obstacles to and the drivers of ICT adoption. Our results show that adoption decisions are highly path-dependent, as managers' perceptions of the benefits of technologies significantly depend on previously adopted technologies and equipment. Firm specific characteristics, Such as firm size and cost structures, also matter, though to a lesser extent. In terms of policy and managerial implications, our empirical findings suggest that in contexts where network effects matter, obstacles to adoption are eased by the development of compatible standards in the market. Furthermore, the diffusion of standards and information reduces uncertainties about innovations and might prove a successful strategy for encouraging their adoption by SMEs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

<p>In this paper, a cross-section infrastructural and regulatory analysis of the European LNG sector is presented. The LNG chain is maintained as being a good tool to enlarge the number of natural gas exporters to Europe, adding in this way to competition and to the achievement of the targets of the liberalisation process, which is a decrease in price for final customers and security of supply. The main reason for this is to be identified in the minor specificity of the regasification-plant-related investment compared with pipeline transportation. As a matter of fact, as the infrastructural analysis will show, the construction of new LNG receiving terminals is likely to bring about an increase in the number of importers fostering competition among them and shrinking their margins among the value chain. In this context, regulation is meant to play a key role in promoting investments without hindering Nevertheless it is questionable whether LNG will be able to introduce competition beyond the European border (that is among producers) according to the forecasted Supply and demand balance that is leading to a seller's market in the upstream sector. In this case, a huger part of the rent would go to the exporters leaving minor scope for competition down the European border. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Manuscript Type: Empirical</p>
<p>Research Question/Issue: This paper aims at exploring the relationship between ownership structure and firm performance in the context of a small European capital market. Further developing existing literature, we acknowledge the multi-dimensionality of ownership by including both the fraction of shares owned by the five largest shareholders and the fraction of shares owned by management.</p>
<p>Research Findings/Results: Using panel data for the period 2000 -2003 with respect to the Italian market, we find that the ownership concentration of the five largest shareholders is beneficial to five valuation. On the contrary, managerial ownership is beneficial only in non-concentrated firms, suggesting that the controlling owner may use his/her position in the firm to extract private benefits at the expense of the other shareholders by appointing managers that represent its own interest.</p>
<p>Theoretical Implications: This study provides empirical support for the agency theory and the managerial entrenchment argument. As such, it suggests new avenues of research for the ownership structure literature willing to reflect the diverging interests of different types of shareholders and to explore both endogeneity and non-linearity issues.</p>
<p>Practical Implications: This study contributes to the recent debate on the effects of government regulations inspired by the Anglo-Saxon model of corporate governance in the small European countries. In questioning the alleged competitive superiority of the widely held company, our paper also suggests that the existence of good corporate law is not a sufficient condition for the development of a corporate economy resembling the US model.</p>"

<p>This article discusses the evolution of the public debate in Italy about unemployment over a period of almost ten years (1995-2002) that was particularly crucial for the Italian labour and political systems. From the early 1980s and throughout the 1990s, the country experienced major industrial change, which dramatically restructured its labour landscape. Moreover, this industrial earthquake occurred within internal (a deep political party system re-assessment and the fluctuating importance of unions) and external (European Union-driven state budgetary limits) political constraints that have heavily influenced the debate itself. The analysis of the public policy debates allows the authors of this article to portray the agendas, concepts and strategies introduced and discussed by experts, politicians and interest groups as pillars of a new edifice of public policies. Although other sources are more complete in presenting the policy-making process on unemployment issues, the focus in this article on the public debate in the mass media reflects a specific interest in the discursive interactions between the symbolic images promoted by different actors. To this end, the authors have combined claims analysis and semi-structured interviews. Through their combined use, the article describes the selective field of contentious politics as far as main actors are concerned: its effect on the policy issues addressed, and the repertoire used for making claims and influencing policies. The authors also single out the role of the European Union and its potential impact on Italian public debates. In particular, the authors are interested in learning how inclusive these public debates are with reference to weakly represented interests and precariously organised groups (particularly the unemployed).</p>"

<p>The number and relevance of EU agencies have rapidly increased over the years: EU agencies nowadays constitute an important part of the EU institutional landscape. The article investigates the EU agencies through categories of analysis well established in studies of public management focused on the phenomenon of agencies at the country level: structural disaggregation, autonomy, and contractualization. It emerges that EU agencies are relatively homogeneous, an aspect that differentiates European agencies from the highly heterogeneous world of national-level agencies. The main features of the EU agencies are examined, the 'European type' of agency is identified and defined, and the way the EU agency model differs from country-level agencies is analysed. Research agendas on the reform of the European Union might benefit from systematic investigation of EU agencies: theoretical frameworks drawn from the public management field can provide a significant contribution in this respect.</p>"

<p>Laws express rules of conduct ('obligations') enforced by the means of penalties and rewards ('incentives'). The role of incentives in shaping individual behaviour has been largely analysed in the traditional economic literature. On the contrary, very little is known about the specific role of obligations. In this paper we test whether or not obligations have any independent effect on cooperation in a public good game. The results show that. for given marginal incentives, different levels of minimum contribution required by obligation determine significantly different levels of average contributions. Moreover. obligations per se cannot sustain cooperation over time, even if they affect the rate of decline of average contributions. Finally. unexpected changes in the minimum contribution have asymmetric dynamic effects on the levels of cooperation: a reduction does not alter the descending trend of cooperation. whereas an increase induces a temporary re-start in average contributions.

<p>This article develops a map to analyze the dynamic forces that influence the structure and development of 3G (third generation) wireless communications value networks. The analysis builds on the Strategic Value Assessment Model (Fine, et al. [Fine, Charles H., Vardan, Roger, Pethick, Robert, El Hout, Jamal. Rapid-Response Capability in value chain Design. MIT Sloan Manage Rev 2002, 43(Winter): 69-75.]) and utilizes a qualitative System Dynamics mapping approach. The map focuses on the driving forces affecting user adoption of 3G services, focusing on customer dynamics, competitive dynamics, and technology dynamics. To analyze adoption of 3G services by customers, the articles maps the dynamics of (1) network investment and user population, (2) entry of service innovators as well as price competitors, (3) the effects of positive network externalities arising from a larger user population, (4) price compression as lower willingness-to-pay users adopt 3G services, (5) scale economies in terminal costs and prices, and (6) new content development as a draw to new users. Applying inductive systems diagrams hypotheses are integrated into a causal loop map and tested with data collected at 15 communications-industry workshops attended by 190 participants in Europe. The map aims to deepen the understanding of the possible evolutionary paths of the 3G wireless value network. The article seeks also to assess which future scenarios are plausible and what dynamic triggers might make them likely. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>We compute an analytical expression for the moment generating function of the joint random vector consisting of a spot price and its discretely monitored average for a large class of square-root price dynamics. This result, combined with the Fourier transform pricing method proposed by Carr and Madan [Carr, P., Madan D., 1999. Option valuation using the fast Fourier transform. Journal of Computational Finance 2(4), Summer, 61-73] allows us to derive a closed-form formula for the fair value of discretely monitored Asian-style options. Our analysis encompasses the case of commodity price dynamics displaying mean reversion and jointly fitting a quoted futures curve and the seasonal structure of spot price volatility. Four tests are conducted to assess the relative performance of the pricing procedure stemming from our formulae. Empirical results based on natural gas data from NYMEX and corn data from CBOT show a remarkable improvement over the main alternative techniques developed for pricing Asian-style options within the market standard framework of geometric Brownian motion.

Four major results emerge from the analysis. First, the introduction of the single currency in 1999 has generated an increase in competition among banks, and, as a result, a reduction in underwriting fees. Second, a strong relationship with the issuer's main bank reduces the level of underwriting fees. Third, new issuers are charged with lower underwriter fees relative to firms that have completed issues without building any strong relationship with a bank. Fourth, higher reputation banks charge lower underwriting fees. The implications of these findings are also discussed.</p>"

<p>This paper investigates the role of objects holding representations of knowledge in the transfer of learning across projects. On the basis of an in-depth case study, this paper shows that the way in which relatively simple artifacts, such as Excel workbooks, represent knowledge enables them to act as boundary objects across occupations and as memory devices across projects. It is the temporal capacity of these boundary objects that makes them points of juncture in a widely distributed memory system, enabling project-based firms to balance preservation and adaptation of knowledge. The mechanisms for the preservation of learning are not missing from project environments, rather they are less visible and less direct than in other settings, and therefore less docile in the face of managerial action.

<p>Recent works have attracted interest toward sensitivity measures that use the entire model output distribution, without dependence on any of its particular moments (e.g., variance). However, the computation of moment-independent importance measures in the presence of dependencies among model inputs has not been dealt with yet. This work has two purposes. On the one hand, to introduce moment independent techniques in the analysis of chemical reaction models. On the other hand, to allow their computation in the presence of correlations. To do so, a new approach based on Gibbs sampling is presented that allows the joint estimation of variance-based and moment independent sensitivity measures in the presence of correlations. The application to the stability of a chemical reactor is then discussed, allowing full consideration of historical data that included a correlation coefficient of 0.7 between two of the model parameters.

The authors investigate the influences of relational equity on attitudinal loyalty and behavioral loyalty. Moreover, they test the hypothesis that relationship age moderates the impact of relational equity on loyalty, adopting a cross-sectional design and data from a sample of Italian customers of mobile phone services (N = 461). Relational equity is recognized as a significant determinant of customer loyalty over and above satisfaction and trust effects, and its influence increases along with relationship age. From a managerial point of view, results suggest that loyalty programs should be tailored according to the age of the relationship. Moreover, particular care should be devoted to monitoring perceived relational equity, especially in longer-term relationships.</p>"

Using a panel of European countries for the 1975-2002 period - disaggregated by cohort and education - we empirically test the economic effects of the ""baby bust"" and the ""education boom"". We find that Structural shifts in the Population age structure play an important role and that a significant share of variation in unemployment rates is also attributable to educational changes, the latter being usually neglected in aggregate studies. Results show that demographic and education shocks are qualitatively different for young (adult) workers as well as for more (less) educated people. Changes in the population age structure are positively related to the unemployment rate of young workers, while have no effect on adults. Conversely, changes in the education structure show a negative effect on the unemployment of the more educated. Labour market institutions also influence unemployment rates in different ways. Employment protection for regular workers increases unemployment rates, while temporary employment provisions reduce it. Unemployment benefits are found to have a displacement effect on unemployment, white corporatism of wage bargaining improves employment performance. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>The ability of family firms to identify and respond to changes in their external environments can be a key source of competitive advantage leading to success and survival. Some research, however, has suggested family firms are conservative and often lack the ability to adapt to their changing competitive environments. Using data from 248 family firms, we found a family firm's culture of commitment to the business is positively associated with its strategic flexibility-the ability to pursue new opportunities and respond to threats in the competitive environment. Further, we found stewardship-oriented organizational culture positively moderated the family commitment-strategic flexibility relationship.</p>"

<p>Theories of network evolution frequently focus on ""network endogeneity,"" which stresses predictable, path-dependent evolution rooted in previous network structure. However, theories of technological evolution and innovation remind us that networks may undergo significant change as technological discontinuities exert pressures on existing relationships and firms engage in exploratory search. How can we incorporate sources of change into our theories of network evolution instead of focusing so squarely on sources of inertia? By using recent advances in graph theory, we develop a more flexible theory of network evolution by examining two patterns of partner selection that have the potential to change networks: ""shortcut"" formation between relatively unconnected partner clusters, and the entry of new firms into the "" main component"" of incumbent partners. Our findings suggest an important contingency for the endogeneity perspective: structural homophily predicts shortcut formation but not alliance formation within clusters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the pattern of alliance formation between incumbents and new entrants to the alliance network is driven by a combination of endogenous and exogenous mechanisms. New entrants attach to more prominent incumbents, but they are more likely to attach with an alliance deal that comprises multiple partners. We demonstrate these findings in an industry where systemic technology encourages cooperation and where network entry is prevalent - the mobile communications industry from 1993-2002.</p>"

<p>Social contact patterns are a critical explanatory factor of the spread of close-contact infectious agents. Both indirect (via observed epidemiologic data) and direct (via diaries that record at-risk events) approaches to the measurement of contacts by age have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, the authors discuss the possibilities offered by time-use surveys to measure contact patterns and to explain observed seroprevalence profiles. The authors first develop a methodology to estimate time-of-exposure matrices, and then they apply it to time-use data for the United States (1987-2003). Finally, the authors estimate age-specific transmission parameters for varicella, commonly known as ""chickenpox,"" from age-specific time-of-exposure and seroprevalence data (United States, 1988-1994). The estimated time-of-exposure matrix reveals a strong element of assortativeness by age. In addition, there are peaks of exposure between people who were born one generation apart (i.e., parents and their children). Models based on the estimated age-specific transmission parameters fit the observed patterns of infection of endemically circulating varicella in a satisfactory way. The availability of time-use data for a large number of countries and their potential to supplement contact surveys make the methods developed extremely valuable and suitable for implementation in several different contexts.</p>"

The methodology, robust to different techniques of TFP estimation, allows us to analyse the sources of regional disparities controlling for the heterogeneity in firms characteristics.

<p>Developing a globally responsive Science-Practitioner-Humanist model (Lefkowitz, 2008) means articulating professional values (supply) and meeting global demand. The United Nations' Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) seek to halve human poverty by 2015 and how organizations respond to this constitutes a formidable demand on Organizational Psychology. A key process for delivering more effective aid is the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, which seeks collaborative contributions from a plethora of Organizations, including business organizations and professions like ours. We argue that a thoughtful articulation of what Organizational Psychology uniquely stands for, and can offer, is therefore needed. It is proposed that a key mechanism for addressing this challenge is a Task Force, whose functions will include the coordination of institutions within psychology, and linking them to those in development. We describe such a task force and outline its core mission (Reichman, Frese, Schein, Carr, MacLachlan, & Landy, 2008). Organizational Psychology's response to poverty reduction should meet Lefkowitz's criteria for developing a more humanist model of science and practice as the MDGs are inherently humanist and values-based.

Considering the size of the market as a proxy for the presence of demand, we find support for the idea that the presence of incentives stimulates innovation. This is particularly true for process innovation. In considering interaction with customers as a way to reduce uncertainty, we find that firms that see customers as the most important sources of information for both innovation ideas and completion, tend to introduce product innovations.

<p>Using Italian data in the period 1999-2002, we estimate the impact of trial delays on the willingness to commit crimes against property. However, the endogenous relationship that links the former to the latter could generate serious problems of inconsistency in the estimation procedure. Since geographical distance can be considered an exogenous determinant of the probability of belonging to peripheral courts, which are typically considered less efficient than main ones, it should represent a valid candidate instrument for trial delay. Estimates obtained by means of Two-Stage Least Squares show a significant positive effect of trials duration on crimes, supporting the hypothesis that some criminals are either sensitive to the discounting process of punishment or aware of the probability of prescription, or both. As a side result, we also find a relationship between courts' fragmentation and trial duration. This suggests that an optimal dimension of courts is likely to exist, and that policy makers should take this into consideration in the design of the jurisdictional geography.</p>"

<p>This paper claims that the regulation profile of the Offshore Financial Centres (OFCs) with respect to the international standards defined to prevent potentially harmful phenomena-such as aggressive taxation, financial instability, money laundering and terrorism finance-depends on their specific structural features. In the designing of the regulatory framework the OFCs policymakers define the optimal degree of compliance maximizing a political cost benefit function. A simple model shows that the policymaker convenience to establish an OFC jurisdiction can depend on peculiar country endowments, consistently with a path-dependency approach. The model is empirically tested using a 222 countries' sample, using different classifications of OFCs. On the one hand we find that the probability to be an OFC is greater with higher political stability, lower crime level, lower voice in international organizations, and if the country is characterized by a Common Law juridical system. Furthermore a low resource endowment seems to have a slightly influence on the choices to be an OFC. On the other hand it seems not to be crucial to use English as official language, to be a former colony, and also the geographical position it is not fundamental. The results are used for an overall assessment of the adequacy of the international policy aimed to fill the regulation gap, raising doubts on the persistency of the name and shame approach.</p>"

<p>This paper analyzes the interaction of financial frictions and non-convex adjustment costs. Non-convex adjustment costs imply that firm-level investment is lumpy. Firms invest infrequently but each investment is large. This allows financial variables to influence investment along two margins. They can alter the size of the stock of capital a company wishes to hold in the long run or they can influence the frequency at which investment projects are undertaken. The empirical analysis of this paper reveals that finance has nearly no long-run influence on the stock of capital in a sample of German companies. By contrast, the influence of finance on investment decisions is substantial. Consequently, finance primarily affects investment frequencies and financial factors and fundamental capital productivity strongly interact in the determination of investment. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

<p>Purpose - The country-of-origin literature has focused mainly on tangible products and has neglected largely intangible services and products such as the arts. The objective of this study is to examine the impact that country of origin may have on consumer perceptions of artistic and cultural products and to explore the variables that explain how consumers form their perceptions of countries as producers of cultural products.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted among adult consumers in Australia, Canada, Italy, Switzerland, and the USA that assessed participants' perceptions of 16 countries with respect to their reputation for nine cultural products.</p>
<p>Findings - The results indicate that product-country images in the arts are affected by country and product familiarity as well as consumers' openness to foreign cultures and home country bias. Countries more proximate to the participants' home country were also better evaluated, especially when the proximity factor played a significant role in the consumption of cultural products.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - While almost all of the hypotheses were supported, additional research is needed to examine the cultural products of non-Western and emerging markets as well as product-country perceptions in these markets.</p>
<p>Originality/value - This study extends our understanding of country-of-origin effects in the context of aesthetic, intangible, and complex products that elicit both cognitive and affective responses. It demonstrates that familiarity with a country of origin has a stronger association with positive perceptions of product-country reputation than does product familiarity, and that openness to foreign cultures, home country bias, and proximity have a positive effect on product-country evaluations.</p>"

<p>Purpose - The aim of the ""viewpoint"" part of this paper is to enhance discussion on the challenges global business-to-business (B2B) marketing is facing. More specifically, academics are stimulated to study the impact of these trends on the internationalization of B2B companies. Managers are urged to engage in open strategy conversations on the consequent opportunities and threats for their global market strategy. Further, this paper acts as a ""Guest editorial"" for a special issue on 13213 and international business.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a literature screening of key contributions highlighting B2B marketing trends on the one hand and theoretical underpinnings of IB on the other. Starting from a practitioner perspective, the paper gradually introduces a discussion on the potential theoretical implications and on cross-fertilization possibilities when merging recent developments in B2B with theory and concepts from international business.</p>
<p>Findings - B2B and IB go hand in hand and the actual challenges that business marketers encounter require critical revisions of core concepts and foundations of internationalization theories.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - The paper identifies trends based on secondary data. They are exemplary and not exhaustive. Future research will have to empirically ""test"" these assertions.</p>
<p>Practical implications - As a result of this paper, practitioners might question their internationalization or globalization approach.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The value of the first part of the paper lies in the intended stimulus of academic and practitioner discussion. The second part draws attention on the special issue papers and their main messages.</p>"

<p>Although theoretical frameworks assume that performance measurement systems (PMS) can be employed for different uses, there is a lack of prior empirical research examining the use of PMS. In addition, recent International Business studies reveal many unresolved issues about the use of PMS to manage relationships between headquarters and subsidiaries. After summarizing the evolution of the use of PMS over three International Business eras, we focus on the decision-influencing use of PMS, operationalized as the influence of the PMS implemented by headquarters on subsidiaries' decisions. Based on International Business literature and Management Accounting research, we hypothesize that the subsidiary participation in PMS design, measurement diversity in PMS structure, the linking of PMS to reward, as well as headquarters' national culture, subsidiary size, and global pressure affect the influence of PMS on subsidiaries' decisions. We collected data through questionnaires emailed to 100 subsidiaries. Findings show that PMS have a greater influence on decisions in cases of higher subsidiary's participation in PMS design, headquarters' cultural tolerance for uncertainty, subsidiary size, and global pressure. Contrary to what is contended by advocates of multidimensional approaches to PMS, measurement diversity and the linking of PMS to reward mechanisms do not have a significant impact on the decision-influencing use. We discuss the empirical evidence providing qualitative arguments derived from a focus group, which reveals the existence of a PMS decoupling and helped us to describe four situations with different levels of decision-influencing use of PMS and different economic performance results. The presented quantitative and qualitative empirical evidence offers several insights for research on PMS within multinational companies. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>The rise of Fast Ethernet as the dominant standard for high-speed connection in the Local Area Networking industry is chosen to study the interaction between increasing returns to adoption and technical change in innovation diffusion. Contrary to most of the empirical papers on diffusion with increasing returns, which study competition between an entrenched technology and a new competitor, the focus is on the case in which several and different versions of a new technology are competing at the same time for market dominance. Within this context, this article studies under which conditions an early technology may fail to capitalise on its initial time advantage and a new version, without a clear early lead, may become dominant. In particular, we will consider a case in which the initial time advantage is made ineffective by consistently adverse technological expectations. Then, we analyse how the arrival on the market of different categories of buyers, sensitive to specific applications, further contribute to weaken the early leader and strengthen a competing version. This is more likely to occur when buyers are highly familiar with the characteristics of that specific version.</p>"

<p>An important question in health services research is the estimation of the proportion of medical expenditures that exceed a given threshold. Typically, medical expenditures present highly skewed, heavy tailed distributions, for which (a) simple variable transformations are insufficient to achieve a tractable low-dimensional parametric form and (b) nonparametric methods are not efficient in estimating exceedance probabilities for large thresholds. Motivated by this context, in this paper we propose a general Bayesian approach for the estimation of tail probabilities of heavy-tailed distributions, based on a mixture of gamma distributions in which the mixing occurs over the shape parameter. This family provides a flexible and novel approach for modeling heavy-tailed distributions, it is computationally efficient, and it only requires to specify a prior distribution for a single parameter. By carrying out Simulation Studies, we compare our approach with commonly used methods, Such as the log-normal model and nonparametric alternatives. We found that the mixture-gamma model significantly improves predictive performance in estimating tail probabilities, compared to these alternatives. We also applied our method to the Medical Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), for which we estimate the probability of exceeding a given hospitalization cost for smoking attributable diseases.

<p>The management literature is paying increasing attention to the phenomenon of imitation. However, there are several gaps in understanding what drives firms' imitative behaviors. Furthermore, a fragmented array of disciplinary perspectives has investigated imitation phenomena in the past. This paper reviews the literature on imitation and offers a unifying framework to understand what theory has said about the predictors of imitative behaviors, in terms of purposes, driving forces and target. At the end of the review, two over-arching rationales for imitation seem to emerge: risk reduction and search for effectiveness. Next, the review distinguishes between what drives the general propensity for imitation of a firm and what makes a specific decision more likely to be imitated by the same firm. Implications and indications for future research are offered in the final section.</p>

<p>We develop and estimate a medium scale macroeconomic model that allows for unemployment and staggered nominal wage contracting. In contrast to most existing quantitative models, employment adjustment is on the extensive margin and the employment of existing workers is efficient. Wage rigidity, however, affects the hiring of new workers. The former is introduced via the staggered Nash bargaining setup of Gertler and Trigari (2006). A robust finding is that the model with wage rigidity provides a better description of the data than does a flexible wage version. Overall, the model fits the data roughly as well as existing quantitative macroeconomic models, such as Smets and Wouters (2007) or Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005). More work is necessary, however, to ensure a robust identification of the key labor market parameters.</p>"

<p>Several years have passed since Hopwood (Hopwood, A. G. (1996). Looking across rather than up and down: oil the need to explore the lateral processing of information. Accounting, Organizations and Society, 21, 589-590) proclaimed the need to explore the lateral processing of information, transcending legal organizational boundaries. Since then, many contributions in the management accounting literature have been published in an effort to overcoming this shortage. The aim of this work is to investigate whether these contributions have brought the possibilities of that powerful intuition to its full potential development. To this end, the paper provides a review of the theoretical and empirical literature oil management control in inter-firm contexts by organizing contributions according to the breadth of the control solutions they investigated, i.e., control archetypes, management control mechanisms, and cost and accounting controls. Our objective is not Only to present the state of the art in this field, but also to evaluate critically the corresponding achievements and to assist in developing new research questions. To address the limitations of the extant literature, we propose the prominence of control problems (cooperation, coordination, appropriation concerns) as a way to integrate the different streams of research, and we highlight some important variables (structure of interests, component and cognitional complexity of tasks) that have been neglected so far by management accounting contributors but, as has been suggested in the organizational literature, may influence control choices. We also identify several areas ripe for future research. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>in line with economic theory, carbon ETS determines a rise in marginal cost equal to the carbon opportunity cost regardless of whether carbon allowances are allocated free of charge or not. This paper aims at evaluating to what extent firms in imperfectly competitive markets will pass-through into electricity prices the increase in cost. By using the load duration curve approach and the dominant firm with competitive fringe model, we show that the result is ambiguous. The increase in price can be either lower or higher than the marginal CO(2) cost, depending on several structural factors: the degree of market concentration, the available capacity (whether there is excess capacity or not), the power plant mix in the market and the power demand level (peak vs. off-peak hours). The empirical analysis of the Italian context (an emblematic case of imperfectly competitive market), which can be split into four sub-markets with different structural features, provides a contribution supporting the model predictions. Market power, therefore, would determine a significant deviation from the ""full pass-through"" rule but we cannot know the sign of this deviation, a priori, i.e. without before taking carefully into account the structural features of the power market.

<p>Conventional economic wisdom suggests that because of the aging process, social security systems will have to be retrenched. In particular, retirement age will have to be largely increased. Yet, is this policy measure feasible in OECD countries? Since the answer belongs mainly to the realm of politics, I evaluate the political feasibility of postponing retirement under aging in France, Italy, the UK, and the US. Simulations for the year 2050 steady state demographic, economic and political scenario suggest that retirement age will be postponed in all countries, while the social security contribution rate will rise in all countries, but Italy. The political support for increasing the retirement age stems mainly from the negative income effect induced by aging, which reduces the profitability of the existing social security system, and thus the individuals' net social security wealth.

<p>The literature on externalities and optimal redistributive taxation in the presence of asymmetric information has so far been confined to the case where externalities are of the ""atmospheric"" type. One of the main results from this literature has been that the so called additivity property discovered by Sandmo [Sandmo, A. 1975. Optimal taxation in the presence of externalities. Swedish journal of Economics 77, 86-98] holds true also in this more general context. This paper extends previous analyses by considering a general model where, even if there is only one externality-generating good, the externality is not constrained to be of the atmospheric type. The model is sufficiently unrestrictive to admit a variety of interpretations. For example, it is possible to interpret it as reflecting the case of different types of agents being differently vulnerable to the same externality. Another possibility is to view agents of different types as not equally effective as externality-generating units. Yet another interpretation can be in terms of positional goods. We show that while the additivity property fails in general to hold, conditions can be derived which are sufficient to recover it both with respect to the commodity tax structure and with respect to the shape of the income tax schedule. Moreover, stressing one or the other of the aforementioned interpretations delivers different results for the validity of the additivity property. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>In his new book, The Future of Management, Gary Hamel is once again inciting managers to revolt. His indictment of current management practices rests on two propositions. First, that most management systems and principles are founded on a hopelessly obsolete management paradigm. Second, that management innovation represents the ultimate source of competitive advantage. Despite his infectious enthusiasm for discontinuous change, Hamel's thesis is far from convincing. While he is surely right that changes in the business environment and new technologies will drive far-reaching changes in structures, systems and leadership styles, it is not evident that these adaptations require a new management paradigm. Nor is it obvious that 21st century management will be based upon distributed innovation, participative decision making and market-based mechanisms. This article argues that the future of management is more likely to involve the extension of existing management principles and practices to embrace higher levels of complexity particularly multidimensional integration - accompanied by greater reliance upon informal structures and systems, including self-organization. These changes imply different leadership styles and approaches to decision making, but not - as Hamel advocates - the wholesale dismantling of existing management practices or the principles that underpin them.

We first review the case for supervisory independence and accountability in order to frame the econometric work on their determinants. We then calculate the levels of supervisory independence and accountability in 55 countries, disentangling similarities and differences among central banks and pure financial supervisors. The empirical analysis of the determinants indicates that the quality of public sector governance plays a decisive role in establishing accountability arrangements, more than independence arrangements. It also shows that decisions regarding levels of independence and accountability are not well-connected. The results also show that the likelihood for establishing governance arrangements suitable for supervision is higher when the supervisor is located outside the central bank. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

<p>Recently, companies have been faced with strong need for integration in order to deal with the trade-offs of the current competitive environments - quick response and customization, technical functionality and stylistic appeal, low cost and top quality. This need has led to the introduction of different integrating positions. Although these positions already exist within the firm, in recent years they have become strategic and therefore have to be carefully managed. The relevance and the management of integrators are particularly evident in the symbolic industries, where the need to combine the symbolic and the functional facets of products and services has become increasingly critical for companies to succeed.

<p>A major policy concern regarding patenting activity is related to the actual enforceability of the patents granted by Patent Offices. The risk of facing elevated legal costs to defend patent rights can affect ex-ante incentives to invest in R&D. This paper analyses whether the availability of insurance policies that cover legal expenditures for patent litigation could increase the appropriability of the innovation. We model a situation in which an incumbent innovator is endowed with a valid patent and an entrant imitator can either directly enter the market or try to apply for a patent, hoping that an error will be made by the Patent Office. The incumbent can accommodate the entrant, file a suit to a civil court or offer a settlement agreement. We model the presence of heterogeneity in the risk that the patents will face an error by both patent examiners at Patent Offices and judges at civil court. We analyse the changes in expected profits for the innovator when given the possibility of buying an insurance policy which will cover legal costs in the event of trial. We compare the cases in which (i) coverage is voluntary and the insurer can discriminate perfectly between risky patents; (ii) coverage is voluntary and the insurer cannot discriminate between patents, and (iii) coverage is compulsory. The model highlights a set of peculiar strategic characteristics of insurance for legal expenditures which contribute to singling out the reasons underlying the underdevelopment of this market. We suggest that the crucial reason for such a failure is not adverse selection; consequently, we challenge the benefits of making coverage compulsory. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

<p>In many countries, reforms of water and sanitation utilities have favored private sector participation. The drivers of this trend are the need to improve efficiency, professional capabilities of service operations, and willingness to relieve public budgets of the heavy burden of investment. Scant attention has been devoted to the great impact this strategy can have on water bills because of the higher cost of capital that is implicit, given the economic risk that the private sector is required to accept. Since it is a capital-intensive industry with a long economic life of its assets, the water industry is particularly vulnerable to the cost of capital. This creates the case for publicly-supported financial schemes in order to keep this cost as low as possible and guarantee long-run viability as well as affordability. The Italian water industry is an excellent case study to investigate the importance of this situation: in the last 15 years, a far-reaching reform has been introduced with the aim of substituting a financing model, based entirely on public spending, with one delegating financial responsibilities to operators through full-cost recovery. Our simulations show that delegating all responsibilities and risks to the private sector can lead to unsustainable price increases once replacement of existing assets are required. The solution is not to give up full-cost recovery, but rather to search for risk allocation patterns that are more coherent with the risk profile of the water industry and help keeping the cost of capital low.</p>"

This paper provides a granular description of style search by means of a semi-grounded analysis of the process of change of leading international firms in the fashion industry. Our findings highlight two different approaches to search - a design-driven search and a market-driven one. The styles differ in terms of triggers of change, locus of change, the role of individual vs structured units (teams and departments) in style creation and style selection, and the expected outcomes. We provide detailed evidence of the two approaches and conclude by highlighting managerial and academic implications that might inform future research on the topic. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Our empirical analysis shows that only about half of inflation rates variation is accounted for by area-wide factors such as monetary policy or oil price developments. National factors (such as labour market institutions) still play a very important role, and a regional component accounts for about 18% of inflation variability.</p>"

<p>A fundamental result of the information technology (IT) and business performance literature is that IT is not a driver of performance per se. However, it can be associated with higher performance if accompanied by organizational change. The identification of the variables describing organizational change is still on-going work. This paper focuses on organizational absorptive capacity and analyses its effects on the relationship between IT and business performance in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Organizational absorptive capacity measures the ability of an organization to complete a learning process. A significant learning effort is typically associated with IT, as it represents a complex technology. To cope with IT's complexity, implementation is typically incremental and is accompanied by a continuous integration effort of data and applications. The degree of integration of a company's information system (IS), called IS integration, is a proxy of IT maturity and quality. In this study, we explore the effect of IS integration on business performance through absorptive capacity, that is, we hypothesize that absorptive capacity has a mediation role between IS integration and business performance. The proposed research model is tested with data surveyed from 466 SMEs sited in Italy, for which exports constitute more than half of their revenues. Results indicate that organizational absorptive capacity has a mediation effect. Alternative models attributing to absorptive capacity a role different from mediation are found to be non-significant.</p>"

In Europe and Japan, where the great majority of patents from public research come from national agencies, there is no evidence of a superior fertility of university and public laboratory patents vis A vis corporate patents.

<p>This paper analyzes the role of private storage in a market for a commodity (e.g. natural gas) whose supply is subject to the threat of an irreversible disruption. We focus on the medium term in which seasonality of demand and exhaustibility can be neglected. We characterize the price and inventory dynamics (accumulation, drainage and limit stocks) in a competitive equilibrium with rational expectations. We show the robustness of our results to alternative scenarios in which either a disruption has finite duration or the crisis is foreseen. During the crisis consumers may put pressure on the Government to intervene, but too severe antispeculative measures would inefficiently discourage storage. Practical solutions to this dilemma cause welfare losses that we characterize and quantify. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>The increase of university patents has raised issues of potential conflicts of interest in Faculty activities. Nonetheless, recent empirical evidence has indicated that very productive scientists contribute disproportionally to academic patenting and that inventing is likely to encourage an increase in scientific productivity. This article adds to this evidence by showing that such beneficial effects are not likely to be earned equally by every scientist. The analysis was run in a large sample of Italian scientists contributing to materials sciences in either chemistry or engineering of materials, and makes use of several econometric techniques that are suitable for treating unobserved heterogeneity, excess zeros, and incidental truncation. Results indicate that benefits are higher when the feedback from applied research is richer, and when regimes of secrecy are less harsh, which is more likely to be the case with engineering, as opposed to hard science research. If confirmed by further evidence, the findings suggest that academic policies in matters of intellectual property rights should be refined and tailored to field specificities.</p>"

<p>We estimate the contribution of international common factors to the dynamics of price inflation rates of a cross-section of 948 CPI products in four OECD countries: United States, Germany, France, and United Kingdom. We find two main results. First, on average, and at least in the sample 1991-2004, one international common factor explains between 15% and 30% of the variance of consumer prices (depending on the transformation applied to the data). Given the high level of disaggregation of our panel, this estimate is best viewed as a lower bound for the contribution of international factors to inflation dynamics. Second, we find a strongly positive and statistically significant relationship between exposure of consumer inflation to international shocks and trade openness at the sectoral level. The latter result holds regardless of whether the original data are expressed in local as opposed to common currency.</p>"

<p>Despite the increasing attention of management scholars to boards of directors, there is still scant evidence on the antecedents of board task performance. The lack of significant results seems to be due to some theoretical and methodological choices followed by scholars, i.e. the almost exclusive reliance on agency theory and the use of demographic data. Following the call for dismantling the fortresses dominating past studies, this paper contributes to opening the 'black box' of boards of directors, developing a conceptual model that considers the impact of board members' diversity, commitment and critical debate on board task effectiveness in performing its service and control tasks. We collected primary data through a questionnaire survey, and we tested the model controlling for board, firm and industry characteristics. Our findings suggest that (i) the predictors we identified, and particularly the board members' commitment, are far more important than board demographics to predict board task performance; (ii) firm and industry contexts exert a significant influence on board task performance; (iii) predictors have a different impact on specific sets of tasks. Thus, our findings support the idea that several board characteristics and contingencies at both industry and firm level must be acknowledged in board design.</p>"

<p>The motivation of decision makers who care for various emotions, intentions-based reciprocity, or the opinions of others may depend directly on beliefs (about choices, beliefs, or information). Geanakoplos, Pearce and Stacchetti [J. Geanakoplos, D. Pearce, E. Stacchetti, Psychological games and sequential rationality, Games Econ. Behav. 1 (1989) 60-79] point out that traditional game theory is ill-equipped to address such matters, and they pioneer a new framework which does. However, their toolbox - psychological game theory - incorporates several restrictions that rule out plausible forms of belief-dependent motivation. Building on recent work on dynamic interactive epistemology, we propose a more general framework. Updated higher-order beliefs, beliefs of others, and plans of action may influence motivation, and we can capture dynamic psychological effects (such as sequential reciprocity, psychological forward induction, and regret) that were previously ruled out. We develop solution concepts, provide examples, explore properties, and suggest avenues for future research. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>The literature oil model comparison often requires the assumption that the true conditional distribution corresponds to that of one of the competing models. This strong assumption has been extended by the notion of encompassing and in likelihood based model comparisons. This paper takes the latter approach and develops tests for the comparison of competing nonlinear dynamic models, focusing on the nested and overlaping cases. The null hypothesis is that the models are equally close to the data generating process (DGP), according to a certain measure of closeness. The alternative is that One model is closer to thee DGP. The models can be correctly specified or not. Their parameters can be estimated by a variety of methods, including (Pseudo) maximum likelihood and ordinary]cast squares. The tests are symmetric and directional. Their asymptotic distribution under the null is either normal ora weighted sum of chi-squared distributions, depending oil the nesting characteristics of the competing models. The comparison of nested AR models, and of nested ARMA models with GARCH errors and exogenous forcing variables (ARMAX-GARCH) are discussed as examples.</p>"

<p>The interactions between mortality reductions and income growth are studied, with a special attention at their relationship prior to the Industrial Revolution, when income per head was stagnant. The choice of individual medical spending is modelled, giving a rationale for individual health expenditures even when medicine is not effective in postponing death. The rise of effective medicine is then explained by a learning process function of expenditure on health. The rise in effective medicine is linked to the economic growth of the eighteenth century through life expectancy increases which foster capital accumulation. The rise of effective medicine has also had an effect on the relationship between growth and inequality and on the intergenerational persistence of differences in income. These channels are operative through differential mortality induced by medical effectiveness that turns out to determine a differential in the propensity to save among income groups.</p>"

The application of the presented framework provides useful results: (1) to improve analysis, and to make proper diagnosis of causes, of productivity loss and to track their evolution over the time; (2) to design and to implement specific improvement projects, aimed at removing loss causes, and thus increasing efficiency and productivity; (3) to establish proper production capacities, by focusing on bottleneck machines, to keep under control the actual system throughput; (4) to make comparisons and internal benchmarking aimed at defining machine management and productive maintenance best practices; (5) to design plant performance reporting systems and build appropriate tools to collect data from the field.</p>"

<p>Bayesian model comparison requires the specification of a prior distribution on the parameter space of each candidate model. In this connection two concerns arise: on the one hand the elicitation task rapidly becomes prohibitive as the number of models increases; on the other hand numerous prior specifications can only exacerbate the well-known sensitivity to prior assignments, thus producing less dependable conclusions. Within the subjective framework, both difficulties can be counteracted by linking priors across models in order to achieve simplification and compatibility; we discuss links with related objective approaches. Given an encompassing, or full, model together with a prior on its parameter space, we review and summarize a few procedures for deriving priors under a submodel, namely marginalization, conditioning, and Kullback-Leibler projection. These techniques are illustrated and discussed with reference to variable selection in linear models adopting a conventional g-prior; comparisons with existing standard approaches are provided. Finally, the relative merits of each procedure are evaluated through simulated and real data sets.</p>"

<p>Since its first inception in the debate on the relationship between environment and growth in 1992, the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis (EKC hereafter) has been subject of continuous and intense scrutiny. The most recent line of investigation criticizes the EKC hypothesis on more fundamental grounds, in that it stresses the lack of sufficient statistical testing of the empirical relationship and questions the very existence of the notion of EKC. Attention is in particular drawn on the stationarity properties of the series involved-per capita emissions or concentrations and per capita GDP-and, in case of presence of unit roots, on the cointegration property that must be present for the EKC to be a well-defined concept. Only at that point can the researcher ask whether the long-run relationship exhibits an inverted-U pattern. On the basis of panel integration and cointegration tests for sulfur, Stern (2004) and Perman and Stern (1999, 2003) have presented evidence and forcefully stated that the EKC hypothesis does not exist. In this paper we ask whether similar strong conclusions can be arrived at when carrying out tests of system fractional integration and cointegration. As an example we use the controversial case of carbon dioxide emissions. The results show that more EKCs come back into life relative to traditional integration/cointegration tests. However, we confirm that the EKC hypothesis remains a fragile concept.</p>"

Drawing on an original survey-based firm-level dataset, we analyze innovation patterns across KIBS, evaluating the explanatory power of traditional classifications of the service sector, as well as the heterogeneity driven by firm and market specific characteristics. Our findings highlight four profiles of KIBS: interactive innovation mode, product innovation mode, conservative innovation mode and techno-organizational innovation mode. When examining in more depth the variables that are associated with cluster membership, we find that firm strategy is the most significant determinant, with size, customer location, and training also playing a role in defining cluster specificities.</p>"

The authors identify how each of these decisions affects the expected benefits and costs (production, transaction and coordination costs) of R&D projects, and formally derive how these decisions interact. The fact that these decisions are customarily allocated to different agents with misaligned objectives pushes top management to strategically adjust the R&D strategy (i.e. the type of R&D performed) in order to affect the organization of the R&D project, an often times decentralized decision taken by a project manager. From the model, the authors develop several implications for theory explain some observed empirical regularities in the management of R&D and derive novel testable implications.</p>"

<p>Empirical</p>
<p>Recent dynamics in the institutional and market environment facilitated the propagation of equity incentive plans outside the US and the UK. This study sheds light on the reasons behind the diffusion of these plans in Italy, a country where companies are usually controlled by a blockholder and these instruments were almost absent.</p>
<p>To gain a deep understanding of the phenomenon, we collected data on both the diffusion and the technical aspects of equity incentive plans adopted by Italian listed companies in 1999 and 2005. The results show that 1) the determinant of their adoption is the firm size, rather than the absence of a controlling shareholder; 2) these plans are not extensively used to extract company value, although few cases suggest this possibility; and 3) plans' characteristics generally comply with the requirements in tax law, so that fiscal benefits can be accessed.</p>
<p>Our findings contribute to the expansion of the traditional knowledge about reasons behind the adoption of equity incentive plans outside Anglo-Saxon countries. Further, they provide support for a symbolic perspective of corporate governance, according to which the introduction of new governance practices may not imply substantive governance reforms.</p>
<p>Our study recommends that policymakers improve the disclosure rules about these plans and avoid the introduction of fiscal benefits that provide an incentive to promote some compensation schemes over others. Moreover, our results encourage members of remuneration committees to pay attention to specific characteristics of the plans.</p>"

<p>In 1998 a new cash benefit for parents with young children was introduced in Norway. Its purpose was to provide a cash payment to parents who either preferred to care for their children at home or to compensate those who were not offered external childcare provision. It has been argued that the new policy encouraged women to stay at home with their children, possibly reducing labour supply. The policy was consequently considered gender-biased, creating reduced incentives for women to participate in the labour market and therefore encouraging a more traditional division of labour of husbands and wives. Given this background of the policy, we undertake an analysis in two parts. We ask first the question ""who takes the cash benefit?"" Second, by applying simple matching techniques, we ask the question ""Do couples taking the benefit behave differently in terms of their fertility timing?"" Using information from Norwegian registers we find that more traditional households (in a broad sense) are more likely to take the cash benefit. Those taking the benefit accelerate childbearing significantly, though the reasons why they do so varies by socio-economic groups.</p>"

<p>Instead of the currently prevailing competitive model, a more collaborative strategy is needed to address the concerns related to the unsustainability of today's business. This article aims to explore collaborative approaches where enterprises seek to build long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with all stakeholders and want to produce sustainable values for their whole business ecosystem. Cases here analyzed demonstrate that alternative ways of doing business are possible. These enterprises share more democratic ownership structures, more balanced and broader governance systems, and a more comprehensive view of organizational goals and performance - which goes beyond the narrow concept of financial bottom line and into a stronger and systematic care of the needs and requirements of the different stakeholder groups. Thanks to this evidence and different theoretical and empirical contributions, we suggest that the strength and sustainability of enterprises come from their ability to fit into the environmental, social, and cultural context in which they operate. By creating values for all stakeholders, enterprises can involve them and gain deep support based on their commitment.

<p>Creating, maintaining, measuring and leveraging intellectual capital is currently considered one of the main - and most difficult to imitate - sources of competitive advantage for organizations. For this reason, companies focus their human resource (HR) strategies more and more on creating and developing intellectual capital. A key method of achieving this is through the use of HR portals, applications that enable single personalized access points designed for specific user profiles and organizational positions. This paper investigates whether and how HR portal configuration is facilitating intellectual capital creation and development. By means of an in-depth case study of a major consulting firm, the study discusses and answers the research question. Results show that HR configurations for consultancies are designed for social capital creation and development, supported by the alignment of HR portal configuration and assessed through HR portal substitution and leverage indicators.</p>"

<p>In order to deal with growing uncertainties emerging in the 3G wireless industry and to preserve their competitiveness, managers involved in the wireless value network should identify future success very early and develop their strategic planning on time. This study, based on a Scenario Evaluation and Analysis through Repeated Cross impact Handling, allows the generation of both qualitative and quantitative scenarios and can be used as an operative planning tool. The dynamic forces driving the scenario are based on the main principles of system thinking and multiple features. The probabilistic data have been elicited with the help of 40 executives in USA and Europe working for companies in the different phases of the wireless value chain. Findings allow to identify basic trends and uncertainties useful to develop corporate or business strategies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This paper investigates the importance that consumers assign to local network effects, Le. the extent to which they take account of their contacts' mobile operators when choosing a provider for themselves. The authors identify individual characteristics that affect the importance consumers attach to local network effects. The study relies on a survey of 193 Italian students. The results show that consumers are highly heterogeneous with respect to the importance they give to the operators chosen by their friends/family members in choosing which provider to use. This heterogeneity is associated with individual innovativeness and patterns of mobile phone usage. For instance, consumers who are more interested in local network effects are typically more-aware users, who use voice services quite intensively. These consumers, who pay attention to local network effects, spend comparatively little proportional to the intensity of their mobile usage. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>In the last 20 years, orphan drug legislation (ODL) has been adopted in several Countries around the world (USA.

Without these incentives, many life-saving new drugs would have not been developed and produced.</p>
<p>For economic reasons, the development of medicines for the treatment of diseases prevalent in the developing world (or tropical diseases) is lagging behind. Among, several factors, the low average per-capita income makes pharmaceutical markets in developing countries appear relatively unprofitable and therefore unattractive for R&D-oriented companies.</p>
<p>The case of ODL may offer some useful insights and perspectives for the fight against neglected tropical diseases.

<p>The objective of this paper is to assess to which extent gas market inefficiencies, such as weak competition, import dependence and lack of flexibility tools, affect operation and usage of storage services in Italy in the aftermath of the EU liberalization process. The analysis is supported by the empirical results of a Delphi survey that we have conducted to investigate storage service provision and regulation in Italy, We argue that the Italian storage sector is at a crossroads. The policy-driven phase of liberalization is ending and the market-driven phase has just begun. The former phase has granted fair access to storage, narrowed the likelihood of strategic behaviour by the incumbent and secured residential users against supply disruptions, but it has proved dynamically inefficient. Cost-reflective tariffs and low penalties for unbalances have both lowered incentives to expand the range of flexibility tools and penalized industrial customers demand. The market-driven phase has just started. The expected increase in working capacity and the entry of newcomers in the authorization process for new facilities are a progress towards the commercial use of storage. To this end, however, a further change in gas market design is needed: the creation of a well functioning spot market. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>A new, intuitive method has recently been proposed to explore treatment-covariate interactions in survival data arising from two treatment arms of a clinical trial. The method is based on constructing overlapping subpopulations of patients with respect to one (or more) covariates of interest and in observing the pattern of the treatment effects estimated across the subpopulations. A plot of these treatment effects is called a subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot. Here, we explore the small sample characteristics of the asymptotic results associated with the method and develop an alternative permutation distribution-based approach to inference that should be preferred for smaller sample sizes. We then describe an extension of the method to the case in which the pattern of estimated quantiles of survivor functions is of interest. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>Past research demonstrates that most people have a certain time of day when they are most alert and able to perform at their best. The authors investigate the effect of consumers' ""morningness""=""eveningness"" orientation and time of day on their performance. Two experiments explore whether synchrony between peak circadian periods and time of testing influences consumers' performance. Results suggest robust synchrony and time-of-day effects on the dependent variables. Study 1 shows that circadian rhythm strongly influences customers' waiting time and service evaluations. The use of signal-detection methods in Study 2 reveals that participants were better able to recall and recognize ads when tests were performed during their peak circadian time. Overall, subjects showed better performance at their peak than at their off-peak time of day.

<p>This paper investigates the relationship between trade openness and the size of governments, both theoretically and empirically. We argue that openness can increase the size of governments through two channels: (1) a terms-of-trade externality, whereby trade lowers the domestic cost of taxation, and (2) the demand for insurance, whereby trade raises risk and public transfers. We provide a unified framework for studying and testing these two mechanisms. Our main theoretical prediction is that the relative strength of the two explanations depends on a key parameter, namely, the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods. Moreover, while the first mechanism is inefficient from the standpoint of world welfare, the second, instead, is optimal. In the empirical part of the paper, we provide new evidence on the positive association between openness and government size and we explore its determinants. Consistent with the terms-of-trade externality channel, we show that the correlation is contingent on a low elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods. Our findings raise warnings that globalization may have led to inefficiently large governments.</p>"

<p>In contrast to the prevailing interpretation of capabilities as collectives, this inductive study of product development in a leading design firm highlights the centrality of the myriad ordinary activities that may shape the evolution of capabilities. A detailed comparison of 90 diverse product development processes over a 15-year period shows, first, that mindful microactivities carried out by individuals in and around the organization and at all levels of the organizational hierarchy are central in shaping the content of the product development capability and its dynamic adaptation. Understanding organizational renewal and competitive advantage may hence require a partial shift in focus from capabilities as aggregate entities, to the practical realities of core organizational processes. Second, this more fine-grained perspective leads to a set of insights on how organizational renewal may be partially shaped by timely managerial interventions aimed at encoding successful experiments into higher-level organizational capabilities. Third, higher-level capabilities resulting from the conversion of heterogeneous experiences display higher process homogeneity and a permanent increase in performance, because of stabilization of managerial attention. My findings contribute to unveiling the concept of capabilities, extending prior research on dynamic capabilities and organizational renewal and providing a lens for research on the microfoundations of capability evolution and organizational advantage.</p>"

<p>This paper explores the impact of some behaviors of strategic account managers on the relational outcomes of the relationships they are in charge of. Based on a review of literature on personal selling and strategic account management, we contribute to a greater understanding of the role of specific strategic account managers' behaviors in fostering synergistic solutions, role performance and customer trust. Results of the empirical study clearly show that the use of customer orientation has a strong influence on customer trust by increasing strategic account managers' role performance and stimulating synergistic solutions. Conversely, a selling orientation negatively affects synergistic solutions, thus decreasing customer trust. Finally, team selling has a positive impact on the attainment of synergistic solutions, thereby fostering customer trust. Based on these findings, managerial and research implications are discussed.

<p>In this work, we discuss the effect of risk measure selection in the determination of inventory policies. We consider an inventory system characterized by the loss function of Luciano et al. [2003. VaR as a risk measure for multi-period static inventory models. International journal of Production Economics 81-82, 375-384]. We derive the optimization problems faced by risk neutral, quadratic utility, mean-absolute and CVaR decision makers. Results show that while the global nature of the optimal policy is assured for risk coherent and risk neutral decision makers, the convexity of the quadratic utility problem depends on the stochastic properties of demand. We investigate the economic and stochastic determinants of the different policies. This allows us to establish the conditions under which each type of decision maker is indifferent to imprecision in the distribution families. Finally, we discuss the numerical impact of the choice of the risk measure by means of a multi-item inventory. The introduction of an approach based on Savage Scores allows us to offer a quantitative measurement of the similarity/discrepancy of policies reflecting different risk attitudes.

<p>Models based on economic theory have serious problems forecasting exchange rates better than simple univariate driftless random walk models, especially at short horizons. Multivariate time series models suffer from the same problem. In this paper, we propose to forecast exchange rates with a large Bayesian VAR (BVAR), using a panel of 33 exchange rates vis-a-vis the US Dollar. Since exchange rates tend to co-move, a large set of them can contain useful information for forecasting. In addition, we adopt a driftless random walk prior, so that cross-dynamics matter for forecasting only if there is strong evidence of them in the data. We produce forecasts for all 33 exchange rates in the panel, and show that our model produces systematically better forecasts than a random walk for most of the countries, and at all forecast horizons, including 1-step-ahead.

<p>Background: While insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are a recognized effective method for preventing malaria, there has been an extensive debate in recent years about the best large-scale implementation strategy. Implementation costs and cost-effectiveness are important elements to consider when planning ITN programmes, but so far little information on these aspects is available from national programmes.</p>
<p>Methods: This study uses a standardized methodology, as part of a larger comparative study, to collect cost data and cost-effectiveness estimates from a large programme providing ITNs at the community level and ante-natal care facilities in Eritrea. This is a unique model of ITN implementation fully integrated into the public health system.</p>
<p>Results: Base case analysis results indicated that the average annual cost of ITN delivery (2005 USD 3.98) was very attractive when compared with past ITN delivery studies at different scales. Financing was largely from donor sources though the Eritrean government and net users also contributed funding. The intervention's cost-effectiveness was in a highly attractive range for sub-Saharan Africa. The cost per DALY averted was USD 13-44. The cost per death averted was USD 438-1449. Distribution of nets coincided with significant increases in coverage and usage of nets nationwide, approaching or exceeding international targets in some areas.</p>
<p>Conclusion: ITNs can be cost-effectively delivered at a large scale in sub-Saharan Africa through a distribution system that is highly integrated into the health system. Operating and sustaining such a system still requires strong donor funding and support as well as a functional and extensive system of health facilities and community health workers already in place.</p>"

<p>This article describes an investigation of the American Girl brand that provides a more complete and holistic understanding of sociocultural branding. Recent research on emotional branding, together with prior work on brands' symbolic nature and their role as relationship partners, represents a significant shift in the way marketers think about brands and brand management. However, a full understanding of powerful and emotionally resonant brands has been elusive, in part because sociocultural branding knowledge has accumulated in a piecemeal way and lacks coherence and integrity. In addition, powerful brands are extraordinarily complex and multifaceted, but in general they have been studied from a single perspective in a single setting. On the basis of a qualitative exploration of the American Girl brand that is both deep and broad, the authors posit that an emotionally powerful brand is best understood as the product of a complex system, or gestalt, whose component parts are in continuous interplay and together constitute a whole greater than their sum. Studying American Girl from the perspectives of various stakeholder groups in many of the venues in which the brand is manifest, the authors attempt to close the sociocultural branding research loop and identify implications for brand management.</p>"

Balancing co-operative and competitive forces in the innovation process to co-create value and to capture part of this value has become crucial to profit from innovation. In this article, we show that this tension between value creation and value capture is present in each R&D project. Drawing on the case of STMicroelectronics, we show that the balance of co-operative and competitive forces in R&D projects is made through the careful alignment of three variables: project knowledge attributes, project governance structure (internal development, co-operation or contracting), and project partner selection (firm or university). The capability to match these three elements explains the success of the innovation process of STMicroelectronics. Building on the experience of this firm, we provide some practical guidance on how managers should trade off these co-operative and competitive forces in organising their R&D projects.

<p>We explore the idea that the influence of interest groups in elections may have positive economic effects. Since the investment decisions of firms determine economic growth and employment, voters have a common interest in making their governments commit to policies that encourage private investments. However, governments may renege on promises for economic stability and choose excessively leftist policies. Campaign contributions by firms tend to restrain the scope for such opportunism and provide a commitment device. This is achieved if firms, after the policy is chosen, contribute to the governing party or to its rivals.</p>"

<p>We investigate the impact of business group affiliation on the relationship between international diversification and firm performance for emerging economy firms. We develop the theoretical arguments based on an integration of the literature on international diversification with the institutional theory perspective. We argue for a U-shaped relationship between international diversification and firm performance, and suggest that a firm's affiliation to a business group moderates the relationship between international diversification and firm performance. Based on a sample of Indian firms, we find that firm performance is positively related to the degree of internationalization, while business group affiliation reduces the positive effect of internationalization on firm performance.</p>"

<p>In many European countries, since the World War 11, there has been a trend towards decentralization of health policy to lower levels of governments, while more recently there have been re-centralization processes. Whether re-centralization will be the new paradigm of European health policy or not is difficult to say. In the Italian National Health Service (SSN) decentralization raised two related questions that might be interesting for the international debate on decentralization in health care: (a) what sort of regulatory framework and institutional balances are required to govern decentralization in health care in a heterogeneous country under tough budget constraints? (b) how can it be ensured that the most advanced parts of the country remain committed to solidarity, supporting the weakest ones?</p>
<p>To address these questions this article describes the recent trends in SSN funding and expenditure, it reviews the strategy adopted by the Italian government for governing the decentralization process and discusses the findings to draw policy conclusions.</p>
<p>The main lessons emerging from this experience are that: (1) when the differences in administrative and policy skills, in socio-economic standards and social capital are wide, decentralization may lead to undesirable divergent evolution paths: (2) even in decentralized systems, the role of the Central government can be very important to contain health expenditure; (3) a strong governance of the Central government may help and not hinder the enforcement of decentralization; and (4) supporting the weakest Regions and maintaining inter-regional solidarity is hard but possible.</p>
<p>In Italy, despite an increasing role of the Central government in steering the SSN, the pattern of regional decentralization of health sector decision making does not seem at risk. Nevertheless, the Italian case confirms the complexity of decentralization and recentralization processes that sometimes can be paradoxically reinforcing each other. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

<p>This paper presents a randomized field experiment on community-based monitoring of public primary health care providers in Uganda. Through two rounds of village meetings, localized nongovernmental organizations encouraged communities to be more involved with the state of health service provision and strengthened their capacity to hold their local health providers to account for performance. A year after the intervention, treatment communities are more involved in monitoring the provider, and the health workers appear to exert higher effort to serve the community. We document large increases in utilization and improved health outcomes-reduced child mortality and increased child weight-that compare favorably to some of the more successful community-based intervention trials reported in the medical literature.</p>"

<p>In this paper we consider the classical problem of dividing a land among many agents so that everybody is satisfied with the parcel she receives. In the literature, it is usually assumed that all the agents are endowed with cardinally comparable, additive, and monotone utility functions. In many economic and political situations violations of these assumptions may arise. We show how a family of cardinally comparable utility functions can be obtained starting directly from the agents' preferences, and how it fair division of the land is feasible, without additivity or monotonicity requirements. Moreover, if the land to be divided can be modeled as a finite dimensional simplex, it is possible to obtain envy free (and a fortiori fair) divisions of it into subsirnplexes. The main tool is an extension of a representation theorem of Gilboa and Schmeidler [Gilboa, I., Schmeidler, D., 1989, Maxmin expected utility with non-unique prior. J. Math. Econ. 18, 141-153].

<p>Recent research on corporate social responsibility (CSR) suggests the need for further exploration into the relationship between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and CSR. SMEs rarely use the language of CSR to describe their activities, but informal CSR strategies play a large part in them. The goal of this article is to investigate whether differences exist between the formal and informal CSR strategies through which firms manage relations with and the claims of their stakeholders. In this context, formal CSR strategies seem to characterize large firms while informal CSR strategies prevail among micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. We use a sample of 3,626 Italian firms to investigate our research questions. Based on a multi-stakeholder framework, the analysis provides evidence that small businesses' use of CSR, involving strategies with an important impact on the bottom line, reflects an attempt to secure their license to operate in the communities; while large firms rarely make attempts to integrate their CSR strategies into explicit management systems.</p>"

<p>This paper presents an empirical analysis of the relationship between fertility and poverty for Indonesia, a country which has experienced unprecedented economic growth and sharp fertility decline over recent decades. We illustrate the sensitivity of the effect of fertility on household consumption with respect to the equivalence scale in a unitary household framework. Using the propensity score matching method, the analysis suggests that a newborn child decreases household consumption per person by 20 percent within four years. When the estimates of equivalence scales implied by the Indonesian sample are applied, the effect of a child on household consumption is still negative, but the magnitudes are in the range of 20 to 65 percent of that found with the per-capita expenditure as a measure of consumption. Therefore, it is suggested that analysis based on the conventional measure of poverty is likely to exaggerate the effect of fertility on poverty at least because of neglect of the proper equivalence scale. Given that household preference for consumption of private goods such as children's education is negatively associated with fertility, the test for household bargaining supports the model of the unitary household as a valid assumption for examining the relationship between fertility and household consumption.</p>"

<p>Review</p>
<p>This study seeks to investigate whether governance research in fact is a discipline or whether it is rather the subject of multi-disciplinary research. We map the intellectual structure of corporate governance research and its evolution from 1993-2007.</p>
<p>Based on the analysis of more than 1,000 publications and 48,000 citations in Corporate Goverance: An International Review (CGIR) and other academic journals, our study identifies the most influential works, the dominant subfields, and their evolution. Our study assesses the maturation of corporate governance research as a discipline; it finds increasing sophistication, depth and rigor, and consistency in its intellectual structure.</p>
<p>There is a large body of accumulated corporate governance research in the US, yet there is an empirical gap on cross-national studies in the literature. Furthermore, hardly any of the top cited works undertake their study in a cross-national setting. Thus, corporate governance research and CGIR in its quest to contribute to a global theory of corporate governance might benefit if articles have a cross-national methodological approach and empirical grounding in their research design and if articles explicitly aim at stating the theoretical underpinnings they draw on.</p>
<p>Globalists find in CGIR an outlet addressing economics and finance (e.g., whether and how compensation or dismissal of CEOs is related to board characteristics), management (e.g., whether and how best practice codes adoption is related to board characteristics and performance), and accounting (e.g., whether and how earnings manipulations is related to board characteristics) issues globally.</p>"

<p>The significance of sport as a social practice remains hidden at the margins of sociology. This article aims to highlight the social significance of sport by providing a sociological interpretation of the transformations of sailing in Czechoslovakia, and later in the Czech Republic, following the Velvet Revolution of 1989. These sport-related changes are understood to be consequences of wider socio-cultural, economic and political transformations. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork of the Czech sailing movement, I argue that during Czechoslovakia's communist period, a time when sailing was labelled pejoratively as a 'bourgeois sport', it actually experienced a 'golden age' of enchantment. Based on Weber's concept of disenchantment and its subsequent developments in contemporary sociology, this article demonstrates how this earlier enchantment was jeopardized by disenchantment threats that occurred after 1989, and how sailing has once again been re-enchanted in the current period.</p>"

<p>The notion of improvisation has recently emerged in managerial studies as a viable answer to flexibly dealing with unexpected occurrences. Nonetheless, research on improvisation has essentially approached the issue through a metaphorical framework, and has regularly relied on conceptual frameworks residing either at the individual or the team-level. We investigate how team-level processes affect individual improvisation in complex project domains. Using data from 138 team leaders and members belonging to 38 information systems development teams, we test cross-level hypotheses through hierarchical linear modeling. Team behavioral integration and team cohesion positively affect individual improvisation. Moreover, cohesion positively moderates the influence of team behavioral integration on individual improvisation. In concluding this paper we offer theoretical and practical implications.

Since our setup features internationally mobile firms, trade frictions, and asymmetric country sizes, it offers a convenient framework within which to investigate how differences in market size and deepening international integration affect equilibrium outcomes under competing tax principles. The origin principle, when compared to the destination principle, is shown to exacerbate tax competition and to erode tax revenues, yet gives rise to a more equal spatial distribution of economic activity. This suggests that federations which care about spatial inequality, like the European Union, face a non-trivial choice for their tax principle that goes beyond the standard considerations of tax revenue distribution.

<p>Methods to monitor spatial patterns of disease in populations are of interest in public health practice. The M statistic uses interpoint distances between cases to detect abnormalities in the spatial patterns of diseases. This statistic compares the observed distribution of interpoint distances with that which is expected when no unusual spatial patterns exist. We show the relationship of M to Pearson's Chi Square statistic, X-n(2). Both statistics require the discretization of continuous data into bins and then are formed by creating a quadratic form, scaled by an appropriate variance covariance matrix. We seek to choose the number and type of these bins for the M statistic so as to maximize the power to detect spatial anomalies. By showing the relationship between M to X-n(2), we argue for the extension of the theory that has been developed for the selection of the number and type of bins for X-n(2) to M. We further show that spatial data provides a unique insight into the problem through examples with simulated data and spatial data from a health care provider. In the spatial setting, these indicate that the optimal number of bins depends on the size of the cluster. For large clusters, a smaller number of bins appears to be preferable, however for small clusters having many bins increases the power. Further, results indicate that the number of bins does not appear to vary with m, the number of spatial locations. We discuss the implications of this result for further work. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

<p>This article illustrates the contribution of mobile inventors and networks of inventors to the diffusion of knowledge across firms and within cities or states. It is based upon an original data set on US inventors patent applications at the European Patent Office, in the fields of drugs, biotechnology and organic chemistry. The study combines the methodology originally proposed by Jaffe et al. (1993, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 108: 577598) with tools from social network analysis, in order to evaluate extent of the localization of knowledge flows, as measured by patent citations. After controlling for inventors mobility and for the resulting co-invention network, the residual effect of spatial proximity on knowledge diffusion is found to be greatly reduced. We argue that the most fundamental reason why geography matters in constraining the diffusion of knowledge is that mobile researchers are not likely to relocate in space, so that their co-invention network is also localized. In the light of these results, we revisit common interpretations of localized knowledge flows as externalities.</p>"

<p>We develop and test a theory of the origins of network structures, specifically of structural holes, building and testing a theoretical framework proposing that network structures emerge from the interplay of two complementary forces: structural constraints and network opportunities. We analyze data on a co-membership network among 501 production teams in the Italian TV production industry tracked over a period of 12 years, explicitly accounting for endogeneity. We find that structural holes spanned by teams originate from the prior status and centrality of teams that members were part of in the past, in addition to structural holes spanned in the past. But a focal team spans fewer structural holes if its members were part of cohesive teams earlier and if the past teams they were connected to produced similar artistic content. We also demonstrate that spanning structural holes is associated with superior team performance in terms of greater viewership. The results support both opportunity exploitation and structural constraint explanations, although we find that homogeneity rather than diversity influences performance across structural holes.(.)</p>"

<p>The present paper aims at examining the role of variety in the ski manufacturing industry and its relevance in firms' price setting strategies. In particular, it intends to investigate and to empirically test three hypotheses concerning the relations between: product quality and prices; variety in technical characteristics and prices; variety in service characteristics and prices. Our empirical investigation finds that prices are positively affected by product quality and positively affected by variety in service characteristics. This means that a high degree of product variety allows firms to charge a premium price on consumers, who are able to find the product that best meets their needs and are therefore willing to pay a higher price. By contrast, variety in technical characteristics negatively impacts prices. In a context where a dominant design has emerged and new varieties are not radically different from each other, the gains in economies of scale and scope outweigh the costs of the increased flexibility in the equipment required to produce variety.</p>"

<p>Europe no longer suffers from Eurosclerosis; unemployment, notably long-term unemployment, had decreased substantially for more than a decade. Mobility across labour market states increased in those countries where unemployment has been falling the most. Institutional reforms - such as declining employment protection for new entrants in the labour market and less generous unemployment benefits - account for this increase in mobility. Focusing on these reforms, we rationalize why EU workers, including those with permanent contracts, are increasingly unhappy about labour market conditions in spite of the disappearance of mass unemployment in Europe. Due to these perceptions, policy reversals cannot be ruled out. Governments wishing to minimize the risk of going back to Eurosclerosis should move towards flexicurity configurations, compensating workers for higher risks of job loss, and introduce tenure tracks to the labour market, preventing the development of dual labour market structures. This would avoid dissipating the employment gains of the last decade during this recession.</p>

<p>We propose a portfolio selection model based on a class of monotone preferences that coincide with mean-variance preferences on their domain of monotonicity, but differ where mean-variance preferences fail to be monotone and are therefore not economically meaningful. The functional associated with this new class of preferences is the best approximation of the mean-variance functional among those which are monotonic. We solve the portfolio selection problem and we derive a monotone version of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which has two main features: (i) it is, unlike the standard CAPM model, arbitrage free, (ii) it has empirically testable CAPM-like relations. The monotone CAPM has thus a sounder theoretical foundation than the standard CAPM and a comparable empirical tractability.</p>"

<p>How do people value freedom of choice? Drawing on economics and psychology the paper provides an hypothesis and empirical evidence on how individuals may value freedom of choice and derive utility from it. It is argued that the degree of perceived control that individuals have over choice - a construct known as the locus of control in psychology regulates how we value freedom of choice. People who believe that the outcome of their actions depends on internal factors such as effort and skills (the 'internals') have a greater appreciation of freedom of choice than people who believe that the outcome of their actions depends on external factors such as fate or destiny (the 'externals'). We find some evidence in support of this hypothesis using a combination of all rounds of the World and European Values Surveys. A variable that measures freedom of choice and the locus of control is found to predict life satisfaction better than any other known factor such as health, employment, income, marriage or religion, across countries and within countries. We show that this variable is not a proxy of happiness and measures well both freedom of choice and the locus of control. 'Internals' are found to appreciate freedom of choice more than 'externals' and to be happier. These findings have important implications for individual utility, social welfare and public policies.

<p>One of the key issues for understanding reciprocity is how agents evaluate the kindness of an action. In this paper we investigate experimentally the hypothesis that the motivation driving an action is relevant for its perceived kindness and, as a consequence, for reciprocal behavior. In particular, we examine the hypothesis that, for a given distributional outcome, positive reciprocity is less strong in response to strategically motivated actions than to non-strategically motivated actions. Our results indicate that, both at the aggregate and the individual level, reciprocity is significantly stronger when strategic motivations can be ruled out. These findings suggest that intentions matter and, in particular, that models of intention-based reciprocity should take into account the nature of the motivations behind choices.

<p>Manuscript Type:</p>
<p>Empirical</p>
<p>Research Question/Issue:</p>
<p>Institutional and transaction cost theories highlight the idea that group-affiliated firms outperform unaffiliated firms in emerging economies. However, the persistence of superior performance among group-affiliated firms could be challenged by the recent, quick development of markets and institutions in these countries. This article explores the link between firm performance and the evolution of the institutional environment.</p>
<p>Research Findings/Insights:</p>
<p>We analyze how business group affiliation affected firm performance in India in the post-reform era, i.e., from 1990 to 2006. Our findings show that: (1) the performance benefits of group affiliation are evident in the early phase of institutional transition, but level out in the late phase; (2) older group-affiliated firms are better able to cope with institutional transition than younger group-affiliated firms; and (3) group-affiliated service firms are better able to cope with institutional transition than group-affiliated manufacturing firms.</p>
<p>Theoretical/Academic Implications:</p>
<p>Our findings support institutional and transaction cost theories, as they show that: (1) when labor, capital, and products markets are characterized by large imperfections and weak supporting institutions business groups outperform independent companies; (2) when markets become more efficient and institutions grow stronger group-affiliated firms fail to show continued superior performance; and (3) heterogeneity among member firms may influence the appropriation of the benefits arising from group affiliation. These findings expand the traditional understanding of the relationship between firm performance and the institutional context in emerging economies, and provide further support for the idea that the relative performance of group-affiliated firms is contingent upon the characteristics of the institutional context and their particular features.</p>
<p>Practitioner/Policy Implications:</p>
<p>The article has implications for managers and policy makers. Managers of business groups should adapt the timing of strategies to the evolution of the institutional environment. Policy makers should focus on the consequences of their policies, as they may undermine the efficiency of large national companies.</p>"

<p>Studies of the impact of trade openness on growth are based either on cross-country analysis-which lacks transparency-or case studies-which lack statistical rigor. This paper applies a transparent econometric method drawn from the treatment evaluation literature (matching estimators) to make the comparison between treated (that is, open) and control (that is, closed) countries explicit while remaining within a statistical framework. Matching estimators highlight that common cross-country evidence is based on rather far-fetched country comparisons, which stem from the lack of common support of treated and control countries in the covariate space.

<p>Background: The development of modern information telecommunication (ITC) technology and its use in telemedicine plays an increasingly important role in facilitating access to some diagnostic services even to people living in the most remote areas. However, physical and economical constraints in the access to broad band data-transmission network, still represent a considerable obstacle to the transmission of images for the purpose of tele-pathology.</p>
<p>Methods: Indifferently using m-phones of different brands, and a variety of microscopic preparations, images were taken without the use of any adaptor simply approaching the lens of the mobile cell phone camera to the ocular of common optical microscopes, and subsequently sent via Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS) to distant reference centres for tele-diagnosis. Access to MMS service was reviewed with specific reference to the African information communication technology (ICT) market.</p>
<p>Results: Images of any pathologic preparation could be captured and sent over the mobile phone with an MMS, without being limited by appropriate access to the internet for transmission (i.e. access to broad-band services). The quality of the image was not influenced by the brand or model of the mobile-phone used, but only by its digital resolution, with any resolution above 0.8 megapixel resulting in images sufficient for diagnosis.</p>
<p>Access to MMS services is increasingly reaching remote disadvantaged areas. Current penetration of the service in Africa was mapped appearing already available in almost every country, with penetration index varying from 1.5% to 92.2%.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The use of otherwise already widely available technologies, without any need for adaptors or otherwise additional technology, could significantly increase opportunities and quality diagnostics while lowering costs and considerably increasing connectivity between most isolated laboratories and distant reference center.</p>"

<p>Multilevel governance is widely recognized as one of the striking features of local development policy implementation and management. In Lombardia, Italy, this framework has been applied in the context of European Regional Development Fund actions in order to increase the number and quality of projects. As a consequence the governance of regional development policies now has new meta-actors: the Programmi Integrati per lo Sviluppo Locale (PISL) aimed at promoting and soliciting projects to be submitted for funding by the regional government. In this paper we evaluate the impact of this new governance structure by estimating a discrete choice model over a sample of more than 6000 projects submitted for funding to the Regional Government of Lombardia. We find that projects within the context of the PISL have a slightly greater probability of being funded, although we cannot exclude the existence of adverse selection because we also find that those projects are, on average, of lower quality from a purely formal viewpoint. We finally argue in favour of this new governance structure, even though we identify some critical points to be addressed in the next planning period in order to enhance the effectiveness of development policies.</p>"

<p>This paper discusses the methods of comparative taxation and provides an outline of an evolutionary approach to this new and promising field of study. The paper begins by discussing what comparative taxation can learn from comparative studies generally and what can it contribute to them. It then describes what a functional approach to comparative taxation looks like and discusses the two main methods that can be applied by comparative taxation: the theory of legal formants and the common core approach. These two functional approaches are placed into an institutional setting in which alternative solutions to tax problems found in different countries' policies are considered in local tax design and in which they manifest themselves in domestic tax mechanisms implementing tax models, frequently through legal transplants. The paper continues by discussing a de minimis agenda for future comparative tax work and distinguishes between static and dynamic comparative taxation: research in the former field may lead to important insights as to the formation of tax families. Yet, it is the research in the latter area that opens up a new set of important issues relating to tax transplants and to the circulation of tax models, showing its potential for applied empirical research. The paper concludes that the analysis of the circulation of tax models allows us to identify a possible agenda for future comparative tax research in which ""five challenges for comparative taxation"" must be faced.</p>"

<p>Background: A wide range of possible malaria vaccines is being considered and there is a need to identify which vaccines should be prioritized for clinical development. An important element of the information needed for this prioritization is a prediction of the cost-effectiveness of potential vaccines in the transmission settings in which they are likely to be deployed. This analysis needs to consider a range of delivery modalities to ensure that clinical development plans can be aligned with the most appropriate deployment strategies.</p>
<p>Methods: The simulations are based on a previously published individual-based stochastic model for the natural history and epidemiology of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Three different vaccine types: preerythrocytic vaccines (PEV), blood stage vaccines (BSV), mosquito-stage transmission-blocking vaccines (MSTBV), and combinations of these, are considered each delivered via a range of delivery modalities (Expanded Programme of Immunization - EPI-, EPI with booster, and mass vaccination combined with EPI). The cost-effectiveness ratios presented are calculated for four health outcomes, for assumed vaccine prices of US$ 2 or US$ 10 per dose, projected over a 10-year period.</p>
<p>Results: The simulations suggest that PEV will be more cost-effective in low transmission settings, while BSV at higher transmission settings. Combinations of BSV and PEV are more efficient than PEV, especially in moderate to high transmission settings, while compared to BSV they are more cost-effective in moderate to low transmission settings. Combinations of MSTBV and PEV or PEV and BSV improve the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness compared to PEV and BSV alone only when applied with EPI and mass vaccinations. Adding booster doses to the EPI is unlikely to be a cost-effective alternative to delivering vaccines via the EPI for any vaccine, while mass vaccination improves effectiveness, especially in low transmission settings, and is often a more efficient alternative to the EPI. However, the costs of increasing the coverage of mass vaccination over 50% often exceed the benefits.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The simulations indicate malaria vaccines might be efficient malaria control interventions, and that both transmission setting and vaccine delivery modality are important to their cost-effectiveness. Alternative vaccine delivery modalities to the EPI may be more efficient than the EPI. Mass vaccination is predicted to provide substantial health benefits at low additional costs, although achieving high coverage rates can lead to substantial incremental costs.</p>"

By employing 1995-2000 data on European regions, an index of regional openness is constructed based on the share of hotels in the population and the share of the population that speaks a second language. This index has an impact on regional performance after controlling for technological capabilities, agglomeration economies, and other factors. Apart from a direct effect of openness, an indirect effect was found coming through patents. This suggests that open regions tap into wider knowledge networks that then affect performance. From a policy perspective, making a region less 'provincial' can be as important as investments in local infrastructures and networks.</p>"

<p>Many academic papers were still being written on mass unemployment in Europe. While, unemployment in the EU15 was falling dramatically. Not only academics, but also European workers at large did not seem to appreciate these labour market developments. I offer two explanations for this puzzling deterioration of workers perceptions of the labour market in spite of disappearing unemployment: (i) labour market risk increased, and (ii) employment growth occurred at the cost of stagnating labour productivity. This means that the new labour market offers a worse risk-return combination. Strategies to address these issues are discussed in the final section of the paper.</p>"

<p>Scholars from different disciplines acknowledge the importance of studying new service development (NSD), which is considered a central process for sustaining a superior competitive advantage of service firms. Although extant literature provides several important insights into how NSD processes are structured and organized, there is much less evidence on what makes NSD processes successful, that is, capable of contributing to a firm's sales and profits. In other words, which are the decisions that maximize the likelihood of developing successful new services ? Drawing on the emerging ""service-dominant logic"" paradigm, we address this question by developing an NSD framework with three main decisional nodes: market orientation, internal process organization, and external network. Using a qualitative comparative analysis technique, we discovered combinations of alternatives that maximize likelihood of establishing a successful service innovation. Specifically, we tested our NSD framework in the context of hospitality services and found that successful NSD can be achieved through two sets of decisions. The first one includes the presence of a proactive market orientation (PMO) and a formal top-down innovative process, but the absence of a responsive market orientation. The second one includes the presence of both responsive and PMO and an open innovation model. No single element was a sufficient condition for NSD success, though PMO was a necessary condition. Several implications for theory and decision-making practice are discussed on the basis of our findings.</p>"

<p>Tourism destination networks are amongst the most complex dynamical systems, involving a myriad of human-made and natural resources. In this work we report a complex network-based systematic analysis of the Elba (Italy) tourism destination network, including the characterization of its structure in terms of several traditional measurements, the investigation of its modularity, as well as its comprehensive study in terms of the recently reported superedges approach. In particular, structural (the number of paths of distinct lengths between pairs of nodes, as well as the number of reachable companies) and dynamical features (transition probabilities and the inward/outward activations and accessibilities) are measured and analyzed, leading to a series of important findings related to the interactions between tourism companies. Among the several reported results, it is shown that the type and size of the Companies influence strongly their respective activations and accessibilities, while their geographical position does not seem to matter. It is also shown that the Elba tourism network is largely fragmented and heterogeneous, so that it could benefit from increased integration. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>During the twentieth century, the global population has gone through unprecedented increases in economic and social development that coincided with substantial declines in human fertility and population growth rates(1,2). The negative association of fertility with economic and social development has therefore become one of the most solidly established and generally accepted empirical regularities in the social sciences(1-3). As a result of this close connection between development and fertility decline, more than half of the global population now lives in regions with below-replacement fertility (less than 2.1 children per woman)(4). In many highly developed countries, the trend towards low fertility has also been deemed irreversible(5-9). Rapid population ageing, and in some cases the prospect of significant population decline, have therefore become a central socioeconomic concern and policy challenge(10). Here we show, using new cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of the total fertility rate and the human development index (HDI), a fundamental change in the well-established negative relationship between fertility and development as the global population entered the twenty-first century. Although development continues to promote fertility decline at low and medium HDI levels, our analyses show that at advanced HDI levels, further development can reverse the declining trend in fertility. The previously negative development-fertility relationship has become J-shaped, with the HDI being positively associated with fertility among highly developed countries. This reversal of fertility decline as a result of continued economic and social development has the potential to slow the rates of population ageing, thereby ameliorating the social and economic problems that have been associated with the emergence and persistence of very low fertility.</p>"

<p>In functional data analysis, curves or surfaces are observed, up to measurement error, at a finite set of locations, for, say, a sample of n individuals. Often, the curves are homogeneous, except perhaps for individual-specific regions that provide heterogeneous behaviour (e.g. 'damaged' areas of irregular shape on an otherwise smooth surface). Motivated by applications with functional data of this nature, we propose a Bayesian mixture model, with the aim of dimension reduction, by representing the sample of n curves through a smaller set of canonical curves. We propose a novel prior on the space of probability measures for a random curve which extends the popular Dirichlet priors by allowing local clustering: non-homogeneous portions of a curve can be allocated to different clusters and the n individual curves can be represented as recombinations (hybrids) of a few canonical curves. More precisely, the prior proposed envisions a conceptual hidden factor with k-levels that acts locally on each curve. We discuss several models incorporating this prior and illustrate its performance with simulated and real data sets. We examine theoretical properties of the proposed finite hybrid Dirichlet mixtures, specifically, their behaviour as the number of the mixture components goes to infinity and their connection with Dirichlet process mixtures.</p>"

<p>The promotion of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is a priority of the agenda of governments in most European countries. The target of renewable energy for Italy, calculated as a share of renewable generation to gross final energy consumption, is set at 17% for 2020 (from 5.2% in 2005). With particular reference to renewable electricity (RES-e) in Italy, its development is often burdened by costs not strictly related to the plant construction and operation, but rather to the risks associated with its development, which lead to indirect costs. This paper therefore focuses on the costs related to the risks perceived by investors in the sector in Italy and the link between risk and success of the incentive system, estimating the additional cost of capital which investors pay when operating in a risky environment. Some policy indications are given to reduce the non-technology-related costs for a faster and more efficient growth of the sector.</p>"

<p>Purpose - This article aims to position current sales research in relation to what academics perceive as important future research areas for sales theory and practice. It makes the argument that after a 20-year period of rapid growth and almost a decade of a transition phase, sales research is now a mature area of academic inquiry. The paper seeks to highlights gaps in current knowledge and promising avenues for future sales research endeavours.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - The article is based on a survey of European sales academics; answers are mapped in matrices demonstrating fields of importance against research volume per subject over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>Findings - While sales research has made many theoretical and managerial inroads, there are still areas where research efforts would greatly enhance both practitioner and academic knowledge.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - Researchers should focus their efforts on the highlighted areas, taking particular account of the interplay between sales and finance/accounting. This would allow researchers to address such issues as budgeting and forecasting more systematically than had been done heretofore.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The article combines perceptual data with Williams and Plouffe's meta-analysis of published sales research to deliver a comprehensive and actionable picture of the state of sales research.</p>"

<p>Purpose - This study aims to develop and test a model of relationship selling management. It seeks to examine the impact of leadership quality and relationship selling, as antecedents of salespeople's relational behaviours, on sales effectiveness.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - Starting from a review of literature, the model incorporates two classes of salespeople's relational behaviours, namely customer-oriented selling (COS) and adaptive selling (AS), two classes of managerial antecedents (i.e. relationship selling strategy and LMX) and one consequence (sales effectiveness). The authors collected data from 164 sales manager-salesperson dyads in a sample of French firms. A structural equation modelling approach was employed to test the hypotheses.</p>
<p>Findings - The findings show that relationship selling and LMX stimulate salespeople's relational behaviours, which in turn positively affect sales effectiveness. Moreover, the results reveal a positive impact of relationship selling on sales manager-salesperson exchanges.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - The study is cross-sectional, and many other relevant constructs should be investigated in future research on the topic. Objective measures of performance may also be incorporated.</p>
<p>Practical implications - The study demonstrates that companies can stimulate desirable behaviours of salespeople, which drive to better performance, by leveraging on controllable organisational factors, i.e. selling strategy and leadership.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The research fills three important gaps in the extant literature. First of all, the study clearly sheds some light on the role played by specific organisational variables (e.g. leader-member exchange quality) and behaviours of salespeople in implementing relational strategies. Second, the study shows that the quality of the relationship between supervisors and salespeople can affect specific behaviours of subordinates. Third, the paper contributes to a better understanding of organisational drivers of customer-oriented selling and adaptive selling, and finds evidence of a positive impact of such behaviours on sales effectiveness.</p>"

<p>Popular parlance suggests that 'you learn more from your failures than from your successes'. However, when it comes to failed innovations in organizations, we find that the proverb is not always true. We suggest that instead, failure may often lead to innovation trauma, an inability to commit to new innovations due to severe disappointment from previous innovation failures. We discuss innovation trauma in the context of Sun Ray, the thin-client computing innovation that came out of Sun Labs at Sun Microsystems. Sun Ray was too closely associated with an earlier, highly publicized failure called JavaStation, and never really got a chance to prove its mettle. We suggest overcoming innovation trauma is a critical but underappreciated aspect of innovation management in companies such as Sun Microsystems that depend on continuous innovation for their competitiveness. Thus the concept has significance beyond this particular case study in that it points to the role emotions play in innovation failure and to the need for managers to mediate such potentially traumatic experiences in order to sustain innovation after serious failures.

<p>Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop and test a comprehensive model of customer trust in a retail service setting. Three levels of the customer-to-store relationship are simultaneously taken into account: customer to sales associates, customer to store branded products, and customer to the store itself.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - Using partial least square (PLS) on a sample of 393 customers of an Italian supermarket retailer, a model linking customer trust (in the store, in store branded products and in sales associates) to overall perceived value and store loyalty intentions and behaviors is tested. Subsequently an expanded model to determine the influence of managerially controlled antecedent variables (salespeople's trustworthiness, store environment, store assortment, and communications) is estimated on the various trust levels.</p>
<p>Findings - Trust in the salesperson and trust in store branded products have positive effects on overall store trust. Store trust, in turn, increases perceived value and loyalty intentions. Looking at the drivers of the three levels of customer trust, Salesperson trustworthiness positively affects only trust in the salesperson. Store environment has a positive impact only on overall trust in the store. Store communication fosters all three levels of customer trust, while store assortment increases both over-all trust and trust in store branded products.</p>
<p>Practical implications - Findings of the study suggest an alternative perspective to the dominant strategies in grocery retailing services. To foster store patronage, retailers have typically invested in price cuts, promotions and loyalty schemes. Store managers may rather use sales associates, the store environment, store assortment, store branded products, and communication to foster customer trust and increase customer loyalty. Managing store brands with the goal to build trust, as opposed to increase immediate profit margins, may call for a completely different approach to private labels. Similarly, the potential relevance of interpersonal trust may suggest retailers to devote more resources to selection, recruitment and training of sales associates, and may stimulate changes in evaluation criteria, incentive schemes and reward systems.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The study aims at filling two important gaps in the literature: the scarcity of comprehensive store patronage models and the lack of exploration of the operational means of improving customer trust in retail services.</p>"

<p>Purpose - Interpersonal relationships can be a key success factor in many service businesses. A capable disc jockey, for example, may help a radio station in improving customer satisfaction. But does he/she help in building customer loyalty too? What happens if this employee leaves the organisation? The purpose of this paper is to assess the overall net effect that customer satisfaction with a key service employee may have on customer loyalty to a service firm.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - The radio industry is selected as a specific case where a key service employee exists. A conceptual model is developed and tested on a sample of radio listeners using structural equation modelling.</p>
<p>Findings - The results confirm that customer satisfaction with a disc jockey increases personal loyalty to this employee. That outcome, in turn, cancels out part of the positive effects on customer loyalty to the radio station.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - The model is tested within a specific service industry and the findings are not generalisable to contexts whose underlying characteristics differ from that industry. The aim is to propose a frame for estimating the net effects of relational trade-offs with a key service employee. More generally, the study contributes to increased knowledge on the topic of customers' multiple levels of relationships.</p>
<p>Practical implications - When designing a value proposition in service industries where a key employee exists, it becomes especially important to add value elements and satisfaction drivers strictly referable to the firm and not to a specific person (e.g. image and reputation, behavioural consistency, overall experience, etc.).</p>
<p>Originality/value - The concept of ""key service employee"" is formally introduced and defined. A crossed design to weigh both direct and indirect relational outcomes is proposed. Loyalty to a key employee is explicitly measured as concurrent loyalty toward the firm.</p>"

<p>We develop a simple test to assess whether horizontal spillover effects from multinational to domestic firms are endogenous to the market structure generated by the incremental entry of the same multinationals. In particular, we analyze the performance of a panel of 10,650 firms operating in Romania in the period 1995-2001. Controlling for the simultaneity bias in productivity estimates through semi-parametric techniques, we find that changes in domestic firms' total factor productivity are positively related to the first foreign investment in a specific industry and region, but get significantly weaker and become negative as the number of multinationals that enter in the considered industry/region crosses a specific threshold. These changing marginal effects can explain the lack of horizontal spillovers arising in traditional model designs. We also find these effects to vary between manufacturing and services, suggesting as a possible explanation a strategic change in technology transfer decisions by multinational firms as the market structure evolves.

<p>In the last century, most countries have experienced both an increase in pension spending and a decline in fertility. We argue that the interplay of pension generosity and development of capital markets is crucial to understand fertility decisions. Since children have traditionally represented for parents a form of retirement saving, particularly in economies with limited or nonexistent capital markets, an exogenous increase of pension spending provides a saving technology alternative to children, thus relaxing financial (saving) constraints and reducing fertility. We build a simple two-period OLG model to show that an increase in pensions is associated with a larger decrease in fertility in countries in which individuals have less access to financial markets. Cross-country regression analysis supports our result: an interaction between various measures of pension generosity and a proxy for the development of financial markets consistently enters the regressions positively and significantly, suggesting that in economies with limited financial markets, children represent a (if not the only) way for parents to save for old age, and that increases in pensions amount effectively to relaxing these constraints.</p>"

<p>Standard models of equilibrium unemployment assume exogenous labour market institutions and flexible wage determination. This article models wage rigidity and the coverage of collective bargaining endogenously, when workers differ by observable skill and may adopt either individualised or collective wage bargaining. In the calibrated model, a substantial fraction of workers and firms as well as the median voter prefer collective bargaining to the decentralised regime. A fundamental distortion of the separation decision in the form of a firing tax is necessary for these preferences to emerge. Endogenous coverage of collective bargaining can significantly modify the model's comparative statics predictions.</p>"

<p>We investigate the relationship between product innovation and firm survival for a sample of 121 firms in a high-tech industry. We find that location near the technological frontier is an important determinant of firm survival. Firms that are located near the frontier are also more likely to be acquired than to exit by liquidation if they cannot survive as free-standing enterprises. This suggests that product location in the technology space acts as a signal of firm quality. Greater R&D efforts increase the probability of surviving; in the event that the firm does exit, however, its R&D efforts do not significantly influence whether it exits via acquisition or exits via liquidation.</p>"

<p>This paper examines the significance of the rapid development of so-called ""academic brands"" in Marketing for the process of academic research and for the work and the careers of researchers: It focuses on the specific case of business market research and researchers. The paper starts by exploring the ideas behind the development of Consumer Culture Theory (CCT) and its impact on the academic community: CCT appears as an emblematic case of branding of an academic community. The paper then discusses the rapid emergence of the Service-Dominant Logic (SDL) as a case of branding which has a direct impact on business market research. The paper then relates the emergence of these two ""brands"" to developments in business market research and more specifically to the development of IMP as a brand. Finally, the paper draws some conclusions about the role of academic branding and its impact on scientific endeavour with emphasis on the future of business marketing research and researchers.

<p>Objectives: In many healthcare systems of affluent countries, general practitioners (GPs) are encouraged to work in collaborative arrangements to increase patients' accessibility and the quality of care. There are two lines of thought regarding the ways in which belonging to a network can affect GP behaviour: (1) the social capital framework posits that, through relationships, individuals acquire resources,such as information, that allow them to perform better; and (2) the social influence framework sees relationships as avenues through which individual actors influence other individuals and through which behavioural norms are developed and enforced. The objective of this study is to provide an evaluation of the effects of GP network organisation on their prescribing behaviour.</p>
<p>Methods: We used administrative data from a Local Health Authority (LHA) in Italy concerning GPs organisation and prescriptions.</p>
<p>Results:We found that GPs working in a collaborative arrangement have a similar prescribing behaviour while we did not find a significant relationship between the centrality of a GP and her capability to meet LHA's targets.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Our data support the conclusion that, in the case of GP collaboration initiatives, the social influence mechanism is more relevant than the social capital mechanism. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Although cost-containment policies in Europe are focusing increasingly on medical devices, the impact of these policies has yet to be fully investigated, particularly in cross-country settings. This paper analyses coverage, procurement, and reimbursement of three inpatient medical devices (coronary stent, knee endoprosthesis and implantable cardioverter defibrillator) in the Italian and Spanish healthcare systems. The research was carried out by reviewing published and grey literature, as well as national and regional legislation; in addition, 19 experts from hospitals and the industry were interviewed.</p>
<p>In both countries, there has been a shift in political power from the national to the regional level. At the same time, the content of public coverage has become more explicit. A major issue in both systems is reimbursement, i.e. the rules about funding the delivery of services included in the benefit baskets. The differences in procurement and funding mechanisms create different incentives that may have an impact on the uptake and diffusion of technologies. These mechanisms, however, can only partially explain organizational and professional behaviour, as the use of technologies in both countries is mainly left to professionals who are exposed to a variety of incentives. There is limited direct and indirect guidance of national and regional authorities over the use of technologies in both countries. It is likely that the difficult search for a balance between introducing innovations, containing costs and assuring equity will require stronger regulatory action in the next future.

We then estimate the model by matching the implied impulse responses with those obtained from a VAR model estimated on Swedish data. Although our model is highly stylized it captures very well the responses of output, domestic and imported inflation, the interest rate, and the real exchange rate. However, in order to account for the observed persistence in the real exchange rate and the large deviations from uncovered interest parity (UIP), we need a large and volatile premium on foreign exchange.

<p>In this paper, the notion of superstitious learning is applied to the context of rare and complex strategic decisions. I argue that superstitious learning is a particularly relevant problem for these types of decisions not only because causal linkages between actions and outcomes might be poorly inferred, but also, more basically, because their performance outcomes are often very difficult to assess in objective ways. I test these arguments with a sample of U. S. bank mergers and find evidence that managers' perceptions of success in previous acquisitions is negatively related to the actual performance of the focal merger, and that this effect increases, rather than decreases, as managers accumulate experience. Consistent with the theoretical arguments developed, the effect is significantly attenuated as the knowledge is systematically articulated and codified and the stock of experience becomes more heterogeneous.</p>"

<p>Although there is growing interest in themed brandstores, we still know very little about the source of these retail environments' power to affect consumers profoundly. Utilizing an ethnographic study of American GO Place, a culturally rich and highly Successful retail environment, we find that effective retailing in these contexts is an intensely ideological affair. In our participant-observation of, and on-site interviews with. consumers at American Girl Place we find that the ideology of the brand manifests powerfully through a variety of different and distinct areas within the store: the Museum, the Library, the Cafe, the Salon, the Theater, and the Photo Studio. Ideological expression is central to each of these places. Tracking the influence of brand ideology through consumers' retail experiences, we theorize about the centrality of retail place in ideological branding. Although the confluence of ideology and retailing has been referenced in prior research, this paper focuses on and systematically develops the theoretical interconnection between the two. The physical immediacy of themed brandstore experience acts as a quilting point that links together related cultural concepts into a strong retail brand ideology. The implications of this theory draw Our attention to ideological and morally-bound retail brand expressions, emphasize the importance of a variety of retail formats within a single store, and provide practical guidelines for retailers eager to build successful brands of their own.

We define sensitivity measures that do not rest on differentiability. We relate the sensitivity measures to classical differential and comparative statics indicators. We prove a result that allows us to obtain the sensitivity measures at the same cost of one-variable-at-a-time methods, thus making their estimation feasible also for computationally intensive models. We discuss in detail the derivation of managerial insights formulating a procedure based on the concept of ""Settings"". The method is applied to the sensitivity analysis of a discrete change in optimal order quantity following a jump in the exogenous variables of a non-linear programming inventory model.

<p>We study how the city system is affected by the possibility for the members of the same cultural diaspora to interact across different cities. In so doing, we propose a simple two-city model with two mobile cultural groups. A localized externality fosters the productivity of individuals when groups interact in a city. At the same time, such interaction dilutes cultural identities and reduces the consumption of culture-specific goods and services. We show that the two groups segregate in different cities when diaspora members find it hard to communicate at distance whereas they integrate in multicultural cities when communication is easy. The model generates situations in which segregation is an equilibrium but is Pareto dominated by integration.</p>"

<p>We use social network analysis to evaluate 'behavioural' additionality aspects of public programmes supporting research and development (R&D). The paper appraises empirically the partnership and knowledge networks created around the R&D activities of the Information Society Priority of the Sixth Research Framework Programme of the European Community. These emergent, scale-free networks are found to play an important role in generating and, especially, in diffusing knowledge by attracting key industry actors and by strengthening overall network connectivity through public support. Public policy should try to facilitate the development of more European organisations that can be characterised as global network hubs, on the one hand, and to draw larger numbers of the most dynamic small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) into these programmes, on the other, to avoid technological lock-ins and mitigate the resistance or network reorientation toward more productive research areas.</p>"

<p>This paper compares the innovation performance of established pharmaceutical firms and biotech companies, controlling for differences in the scale and scope of research. We develop a structural model to analyze more than 3,000 drug research and development projects advanced to preclinical and clinical trials in the United States between 1980 and 1994. Key to our approach is careful attention to the issue of selection. Firms choose which compounds to advance into clinical trials. This choice depends not only on the technical promise of the compound, but also on commercial considerations such as the expected profitability of the market or concerns about product cannibalization. After controlling for selection, we find that (a) even after controlling for scale and scope in research, established pharmaceutical firms are more innovative than newly entered biotech firms; (b) older biotech firms display selection behaviors and innovation performances similar to established pharmaceutical firms; and (c) compounds licensed during preclinical trials are as likely to succeed as internal compounds of the licensor, which is inconsistent with the ""lemons"" hypothesis in technology markets.</p>"

<p>Hierarchical clustering is a common procedure for identifying structure in a dataset, and this is frequently used for organizing genomic data. Although more advanced clustering algorithms are available, the simplicity and visual appeal of hierarchical clustering have made it ubiquitous in gene expression data analysis. Hence, even minor improvements in this framework would have significant impact. There is currently no simple and systematic way of assessing and displaying the significance of various clusters in a resulting dendrogram without making certain distributional assumptions or ignoring gene-specific variances. In this work, we introduce a permutation test based on comparing the within-cluster structure of the observed data with those of sample datasets obtained by permuting the cluster membership. We carry out this test at each node of the dendrogram using a statistic derived from the singular value decomposition of variance matrices. The p-values thus obtained provide insight into the significance of each cluster division. Given these values, one can also modify the dendrogram by combining non-significant branches. By adjusting the cut-off level of significance for branches, one can produce dendrograms with a desired level of detail for ease of interpretation. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by applying it to illustrative datasets. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Studies have found that people are overconfident in estimation involving difficult tasks but underconfident in easy tasks. Conversely, they are overconfident in placing themselves in easy tasks but underconfident in hard tasks. These findings can be explained by a regression hypothesis that implies random errors in estimation as well as by rational Bayesian updating (that implies no random error). We test these hypotheses in five experiments. We find overconfidence in estimation involving hard tasks but underconfidence in easy tasks. However, for placement (involving both easy and hard tasks) we find no overconfidence, regression effects due to low and high anchor points, and extreme underconfidence when people choose between multiple alternatives. On the other hand, when given precise information about absolute performance, people's re-assessments of relative performance are consistent with the Bayesian model. Since placement judgments are important in many competitive settings, our results emphasize the need for more research to identify their determinants. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

<p>In the past fifteen years, the Italian welfare state has gone through various important reforms. Almost all social policy fields have been significantly challenged by the presence of both national and European constraints, and in different policy fields some fundamental principles of the welfare state have been questioned and changed. The purpose of this article is to present an analysis of the most recent arguments used for welfare state reforms in Italy, focusing in particular on one key question: have the reforms been formulated and implemented in order to increase the freedom of choice of Italian citizens with respect to social protection? After a brief introduction and conceptual clarification, each section of the article will focus on one social policy field (employment, pensions, health care) and discuss the origins and consequences of the reforms with respect to the freedom of choice of citizens. The main argument is that very limited attention has been paid in the national political discourse and reform design to the freedom of choice for citizens in welfare state policies, since other goals (such as cost containment) were much more crucial. The article will end with an overall assessment of the evolution of freedom of choice in the Italian welfare state setting.</p>"

<p>Recent studies have shown that consumers' product choices are significantly influenced by media coverage and recommendations in various media outlets. Unlike advertising, consumers perceive these sources as neutral and more credible because they usually presume that editorial content and product coverage in newspapers and magazines are independent and free from advertisers' influence. In this article, the authors show how advertising activities of firms may influence media coverage to the firms' advantage. They analyze a recent (2002-2003) large data set comprising 291 fashion companies based in Italy and their advertising and product coverage data published in newspapers and magazines of 123 publishers from Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Controlling for firm heterogeneity, endogeneity, and the simultaneity of advertising and coverage, the authors find that, overall, (1) there is evidence of a strong positive influence of advertising on coverage, (2) publishers that depend more on a specific industry for their advertising revenues are prone to a higher degree of influence from their corporate advertisers than others, (3) peer pressures from competing publishers affect coverage decisions, (4) larger and more innovative companies are at an advantage for obtaining coverage for their products, and (5) the effects of corporate advertising influence exist in both Europe and the United States. These findings raise concerns about the independence of editorial content and coverage of magazines.</p>"

Data from 328 sales associates reporting to 114 middle managers, and 93 middle managers reporting to 32 executive managers are used to test the research hypotheses. Using hierarchical linear modeling we find that managers' coaching intensity influences the performance of their subordinates after controlling for job satisfaction, and this effect weakens at greater hierarchical levels. Surprisingly, we do not observe any cross-level moderating effects of coaching intensity on the satisfaction-performance relationship. We discuss the implications of our findings for future research and practice.</p>"

<p>We apply the well known Gini index to the measurement of concentration in survival times within groups of patients, and as a way to compare the distribution of survival times across groups of patients in clinical studies. In particular, we propose an estimator of a restricted version of the index from right censored data. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the resulting Gini statistic, and construct an estimator for its asymptotic variance. We use these results to propose a novel test for differences in the heterogeneity of survival distributions, which may suggest the presence of a differential treatment effect for some groups of patients. We focus in particular on traditional and generalized cure rate models, i.e., mixture models with a distribution of the lifetimes of the cured patients that is either degenerate at infinity or has a density. Results from a simulation study suggest that the Gini index is useful in some situations, and that it should be considered together with existing tests (in particular, the Log-rank, Wilcoxon, and Gray-Tsiatis tests). Use of the test is illustrated on the classic data arising from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group melanoma clinical trial E1690.</p>"

<p>Forward-looking disclosures are a crucial source of information when valuing a company. We study the effect of forward-looking disclosures on analysts' forecast properties, in particular accuracy and dispersion. Our sample includes all the non-financial firms from Italy, Germany, France and Switzerland that in year 2002 were cross-listed on local stock exchanges and on the New York Stock Exchange. We conduct a content analysis on the Annual Report and the 20F form of these companies for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004. We differentiate between forward-looking information on the basis of the disclosure of expected effects on future financial performance and the disclosure of a measure of this impact. We define forward-looking information disclosed with the characteristics of being quantified and directed (and financial) as financially verifiable as it facilitates the comparison with its subsequent realisation in relation to expected future financial performance. Our analysis finds support for the theoretical prediction that verifiable disclosures are more effective than unverifiable disclosures at improving accuracy and reducing dispersion of analysts' forecasts. Our sample also allows us to explore the effects of the difference between the degrees of verifiability between forward-looking disclosures of the 20F form versus those of the domestic annual report. Our analysis provides empirical support for the hypotheses that these differences are significant and have a significant effect on forecast properties.</p>"

<p>In this study the authors investigate how dispersion of influence between Marketing and Sales (DIMS) affects the creation of superior customer value and the firm's market performance. Hypotheses are tested on a sample of 326 strategic business units using structural equation modelling analysis. Three main results emerge which contribute to the understanding of the consequences of DIMS within companies. First, DIMS increases interaction and collaboration between Marketing and Sales, without blurring their respective goals, roles and responsibilities. Second, DIMS contributes to the diffusion of a customer oriented-culture across the organization. Third, the findings of this study clarify how and why DIMS affects organizational performance by showing simultaneously that superior customer value mediates the effects of DIMS on market performance, and that Marketing-Sales interface and customer-oriented culture mediate the effects of DIMS on superior customer value. The authors discuss the study's theoretical contributions and offer directions for future research. Overall, this study provides a new and broader perspective to managers responsible for the allocation of decision making influence between Marketing and Sales over a range of market-related issues.

While there is always a positive correlation between upstream bargaining weight and offshoring activities, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between these and growth. Whether offshoring with incomplete contracts also increases consumption depends on firm heterogeneity. As for welfare, whereas with complete contracts an R&D subsidy is enough to solve the inefficiency due to R&D spillovers, with incomplete contracts a production subsidy is also needed.</p>"

<p>The discussion on the causes of the most recent fertility decline in Europe, and in particular on the emergence of lowest-low fertility, emphasizes the relevance of cultural factors in addition to economic ones. As part of such a cultural framework, the heterogeneity of preferences concerning the ""career vs. family"" dichotomy has been systematized in the ""Preference Theory"" approach developed by Catherine Hakim. This heterogeneity in preferences, however, has so far been underinvestigated in a comparative framework. This paper makes use of comparative data from the 2004/2005 Round of the European Social Survey to test the links between individual-level preferences and both fertility outcomes and fertility intentions, in a variety of societal settings.

<p>In this article, we study fertility decision-making through timing parity-progression intentions. The theoretical framework builds on Ajzen's social-psychological ""Theory of Planned Behavior"": intentions are seen as directly dependent on three components: attitudes, norms and perceived behavioural control. We study the case of Bulgaria, a ""lowest-low"" fertility country. In 2002, a sample survey containing a specially designed module was conducted. This module included an implementation of our framework, with a special attention to the links between normative pressure and the social network of respondents. Results show that the three components are broadly predictive of fertility intentions. More specifically, attitudes are more relevant than norms for higher parities. Socio-economic, ideational, psychological and social capital-based factors are relevant background determinants.</p>"

<p>The aim of this article is to examine the determinants of couples' childbearing intentions, by explicitly taking into account the agreement or disagreement of the two members of the couple. The relevance of the partner's reproductive intentions has been well recognised in the literature, but few studies have provided in-depth analyses of the fertility plans of both partners. In our study, we used the household-level data from a survey on ""Family and Social Subjects"", carried out by the Italian National Statistical Office in 2003, which provides characteristics on both partners. We adopted a couple's perspective which allows us to give a unitary picture of the concordant or discordant nature of partners' first child intentions. We found that a lack of agreement in the reproductive decision-making process is likely to occur in the Italian couples where the role of the woman is less traditional. In particular, cohabitant, highly educated and working women are more likely to be in disagreement with their partners in the decisions concerning having a first child. Being religious may be also a source of discordance in the couples' reproductive plans. Our findings support the utility of taking a couple-based approach in studies on fertility intentions.</p>"

<p>Strong focus on the promotion of health and social integration aspects in society means the state has increased pressure on sport associations to deliver its social policy agenda. The building of (corporate) social responsibility is offered as a possible progressive response to changes in Danish state sport policy and as a way to increase its social capital. A correlation between (corporate) social responsibility and social capital is established and visualized in the official stand on social responsibility of individual and umbrella sport governing bodies, and Danish state policy. Ness's definition of corporate social responsibility as the necessity and the duty of companies to behave responsibly, ethically and sustainably, and to be transparently accountable to their stakeholders, is transferred to sport associations. Social capital could be defined as the relational resources that we as individuals or as part of a collective, such as a sport association, inherit or intentionally construct to achieve our own goals. Depending on the structural and normative characteristics of the social system in which it operates, it can facilitate but also limit individual and collective action. Development of a contemporary grounded social responsibility by the sport governing bodies suggests a gain in social capital, new memberships and future assurance of financial and social support.</p>"

<p>Severe alcohol abuse can lead to death and disability. A large number of educational programmes for young people's drinking behaviour have been developed to counteract alcohol abuse. The aim of this research was to assess whether those programmes are rational from an economic point of view. It relies on a systematic review of economic evaluation analysis providing evidence on the status of those programmes. Only one study met all the inclusion criteria. This result suggested the performance of an economic evaluation of secondary data. A second systematic literature review with different inclusion criteria was therefore carried out. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria, but only three provided evidence of effectiveness. According to our simulations, if the interventions are effective they are also cost-effective. In other words if they can provide evidence of a decrease in alcohol use and abuse they can also provide evidence that the interventions are rational from an economic point of view. The review suggests two final comments. First, the current investment in preventive programmes is very limited. Secondly, larger studies and more adequate systems of evaluation are needed to provide scientific evidence of the impact of preventive educational strategies on alcohol abuse in young people.</p>"

<p>Companies have recently begun to use the Internet to integrate their customers more actively into various phases of the new product development process. One such strategy involves empowering customers to cooperate in selecting the product concepts to be marketed by the firm. In such scenarios, it is no longer the company but rather its customers who decide democratically which products should be produced. This article discusses the first set of empirical studies that highlight the important psychological consequences of this power shift. The results indicate that customers who are empowered to select the products to be marketed show stronger demand for the underlying products even though they are of identical quality in objective terms (and their subjective product evaluations are similar). This seemingly irrational finding can be observed because consumers develop a stronger feeling of psychological ownership of the products selected. The studies also identify two boundary conditions for this ""empowerment-product demand"" effect: It diminishes (1) if the outcome of the joint decision-making process does not reflect consumers' preferences and (2) if consumers do not believe that they have the relevant competence to make sound decisions.</p>"

<p>The rapid international expansion by financial services firms since the early 1990s has occurred in the absence of any consistent evidence of such growth being associated with performance gains. Opportunism and imitation are identified as the key drivers of cross-border expansion, suggesting that internationalisation strategies need to be based on a more rigorous analysis of the sources of cross-border value creation. Applying Ghemawat's 'Triple-A' global strategy analysis framework identifies the sources of value creation from internationalisation in financial services, but also reveals the internal diversity of the financial services sector with regard to product and national market differences. Hence internationalisation strategies need to be uniquely tailored to the positioning and competitive advantages of individual financial services companies.</p>
<p>These complexities of internationalisation strategy in financial services pose massive challenges to strategy implementation. The greatest management problem for financial services multinationals is to design structures and systems that can reconcile the (often very) divergent strategic requirements of different products and markets. The scale of this problem increases with additional product and international diversity. The organisational structures and systems of coordination and control that have proven effective for industrial multinationals have been less successful for financial services multinationals, partly because of the latters' greater strategic complexity and partly because the requirements for effective risk management create major barriers to decentralization. Given these challenges, financial services firms need to avoid the overconfidence that has characterised their aggressive international expansion of recent years, and adopt cross-border strategies that are sequential, experimental and adaptive.

<p>The concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been widely investigated, but a generally accepted theoretical framework does not yet exist. This paper argues that the idiosyncrasies of large firms and SMEs explains the different approaches to CSR, and that the notion of social capital is a more useful way of understanding the CSR approach of SMEs, whereas stakeholder theory more closely addresses the CSR approach of large firms. Based on the extant literature, we present a comparison of large firm and SME idiosyncrasies suggesting that both consolidated and emerging strategic orientations toward responsible behaviours exist. Idiosyncrasies of large firms and SMEs are also discussed to provide an assessment of the firm's strategic CSR orientation, suggesting the key drivers upon which CSR strategies must be based. A twofold consideration emerges. First, the CSR-SME relationship could be better explained if the notion of social capital is taken into account, but this should also be accompanied by a stakeholder view of the SME; second, social capital and stakeholder theory should be taken as alternative ways of explaining CSR in both large firms and SMEs.</p>"

<p>Many companies offer websites that enable customers to design their own individual products, which the manufacturer can then produce to order. To date, the economic value of products self-designed using mass customization (MC) toolkits has been attributed to the two factors of preference fit achieved (which should be as high as possible) and design effort (which should be as low as possible). On the basis of literature on behavioral decision making, we suggest a third factor, namely the awareness of being the creator of the product design. In the course of five different studies, we provide experimental evidence that this ""I designed it myself"" effect creates economic value for the customer. Regardless of the two other factors, self-designed products generate a significantly higher willingness to pay. This effect is mediated by feelings of accomplishment and moderated by the outcome of the process as well as the individual's perceived contribution to the self-design process. These findings have important implications for MC companies: It is not enough merely to design MC toolkits in such a way that preference fit is maximized and design effort is minimized. To capture the full value of MC, toolkits should also elicit ""I designed it myself"" feelings.</p>"

<p>Understanding the effects of IT-related innovations on firm performance is crucial for businesses. Extant research has investigated the implications of IT innovations and provided some important findings, but the varied theoretical approaches have produced results that are often ambiguous: thus there is a need to examine the process further. We attempted to provide a systematic, theoretically informed framework for understanding the conditions that may enhance (or hinder) the potential of IT innovations in a sample of firms. Our model included business and IT resources, both internal and external, that may influence the performance of firms which have applied a pervasive IT service innovation: e-commerce. Our empirical test of the model used a research design that takes into account time-lag effects. The model explained more than half of the variance in the performance of IT innovators and offered several explanations for why some firms succeeded in implementing IT service innovations while others did not. Several theoretical and managerial implications result from these findings. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

We combine arguments on the 'bright' and 'dark' side of family involvement in the firm; we complement positive predictions on family involvement with negative predictions and develop family firm-specific measures of TMTs' familiness. Results indicate that while the presence of a family CEO is beneficial for firm performance, the coexistence of 'factions' in family and non-family managers within the TMT has the potential to create schisms among the subgroups and consequently hurt firm performance. We find support for a hypothesized U-shaped relationship between the ratio of family members in the TMT and firm performance. Additional evidence related to interactions between firm listing and CEO type on firm performance is then presented and discussed.</p>"

<p>Background: Over diagnosis of malaria contributes to improper treatment, wastage of drugs and resistance to the few available drugs. This paper attempts to estimate the rates of over diagnosis of malaria among children attending dispensaries in rural Tanzania and examines the potential cost implications of improving the quality of diagnosis.</p>
<p>Methodology/Principal Findings: The magnitude of over diagnosis of malaria was estimated by comparing the proportion of outpatient attendees of all ages clinically diagnosed as malaria to the proportion of attendees having a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test over a two month period. Pattern of causes of illness observed in a <2 year old cohort of children over one year was compared to the pattern of causes of illness in <5 year old children recorded in the routine health care system during the same period. Drug and diagnostic costs were modelled using local and international prices. Over diagnosis of malaria by the routine outpatient care system compared to RDT confirmed cases of malaria was highest among <5 year old children in the low transmission site (RR 17.9, 95% CI 5.8-55.3) followed by the >= 5 year age group in the lower transmission site (RR 14.0.95% CI 8.2-24.2). In the low transmission site the proportion of morbidity attributable to malaria was substantially lower in <2 year old cohort compared to children seen at routine care system. (0.08% vs 28.2%; p<0.001). A higher proportion of children were diagnosed with ARI in the <2 year old cohort compared to children seen at the routine care system (42% vs 26%; p<0.001). Using a RDT reduced overall drug and diagnostic costs by 10% in the high transmission site and by 15% in the low transmission site compared to total diagnostic and drug costs of treatment based on clinical judgment in routine health care system.</p>
<p>Implications: The introduction of RDTs is likely to lead to financial savings. However, improving diagnosis to one disease may lead to over diagnosis of another illness. Quality improvement is complex but introducing RDTs for the diagnosis of malaria is a good start.</p>"

Design modularity is also positively associated with the performance of the project. Finally, the interaction between skill heterogeneity and modularity is negatively associated with performance.

<p>The increasing competition in the labor market for human capital pushes firms to create better incentives to manage talented individuals. In this article, we model the optimal employment contract when two features of human capital are present: (i) private information of the employee about his skills; and (ii) the inability to contract on the output of the employment activity. Our model shows how firms can use delegation (i.e., the employee's job autonomy) to provide the incentives to a privately informed employee. The model novelty resides in turning a classic source of potential inefficiency like asymmetric information into a factor that firms can use to design incentives. Our model provides a new explanation of why, in technologically dynamic environments, one observes more intense formations of start-ups and a greater inter-firm mobility of human capital. Our setting also suggests how established companies can use their complementary assets to provide better incentives to their skilled employees.</p>"

<p>Innovation diffusion theory suggests that consumers differ concerning the number of contacts they have and the degree and the direction to which social influences determine their choice to adopt. To test the impacts of these factors on innovation diffusion, in particular the occurrence of hits and flops, a new agent-based model for innovation diffusion is introduced. This model departs from existing percolation models by using more realistic agents (both individual preferences and social influence) and more realistic networks (scale free with cost constraints). Furthermore, it allows consumers to weight the links they have, and it allows links to be directional. In this way this agent-based model tests the effect of VIPs who can have a relatively large impact on many consumers. Results indicate that markets with high social influence are more uncertain concerning the final success of the innovation and that it is more difficult for the innovation to take off. As consumers affect each other to adopt or not at the beginning of the diffusion, the new product has more difficulties to reach the critical mass that is necessary for the product to take off. In addition, results of the simulation experiments show under which conditions highly connected agents (VIPs) determine the final diffusion of the innovation. Although hubs are present in almost any network of consumers, their roles and their effects in different markets can be very different. Using a scale-free network with a cut-off parameter for the maximum number of connections a hub can have, the simulation results show that when hubs have limits to the maximum number of connections the innovation diffusion is severely hampered, and it becomes much more uncertain. However, it is found that the effect of VIPs on the diffusion curve is often overestimated. In fact when the influence of VIPs on the decision making of the consumers is strengthened compared with the influence of normal friends, the diffusion of the innovation is not substantially facilitated. It can be concluded that the importance of VIPs resides in their capacity to inform many consumers and not in a stronger persuasive power.</p>"

<p>European regions have experienced a greater presence of service producers in their economy over the last few decades. Indeed, the manufacturing sector increasingly contracts out many activities to intermediate producer services. This is mostly because they are located close to each other and because services experience increasing returns to scale which reduce their marginal costs. In this paper, we propose to measure the extent to which productivity in services has converged across European regions. The model we use, originally developed by Verdoorn (1949), takes the increasing returns to scale explicitly into account. We apply spatial econometric techniques and control for border effects by introducing two different spatial weights matrices under the assumption that economic interactions decrease very substantially when a national border is passed. Furthermore, we take proper care of the presence of both types (spatial and non-spatial) of endogeneity by using spatial two stages least squares (Kelejian and Prucha 1998). Our conclusions bring new insights in the identification of regional productivity differentials.</p>"

In order to clarify the issue, the aim of the research is to investigate the relative effectiveness of comparative and non-comparative advertising in communicating the differentiating attributes of a brand.</p>
<p>A two independent group experiment was conducted. Two hundred and eighty participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions in which they were exposed to a comparative or a non-comparative print ad. Results show that comparative advertising's effect depends on consumers' perceived differentiation among the brands and consumers' level of involvement with the specific product category. Findings demonstrate that high-involvement consumers that perceive low differentiation among brands represent the perfect target group for comparative advertising in case the aim of the marketing manager is to distinguish a particular brand among the others.</p>
<p>This study provides evidence of the relevance of these two moderating factors: not all customers belonging to a product target group perceive comparative advertising equivalently. As a consequence, marketers should implement the advertising strategy which is more likely to be effective considering the characteristics of the main target.</p>"

<p>There is a commonly held conviction among governance scholars and practitioners that increasing the number of non-executive directors may have beneficial effects on board practices. This view has gained momentum after each wave of scandals. Given the relevance of the issue in governance studies and practices, the aim of this paper is to investigate how independent, competent and incentivized non-executive directors should be according to governance scholars and board best practices. To answer this question, we conducted a review of the literature on non-executive directors. We then collected corporate governance codes developed worldwide at the end of 2005, and made a comparative analysis of their recommendations about the independence, the competencies and the incentives of non-executive directors. Our results show that (i) non-executive directors' independence is a commonly recommended governance practice, the meaning of which differs widely among countries; (ii) non-executive directors' competencies and incentives are not considered a governance issue to be regulated in detail; (iii) agency theory and the search for appropriate board demography tend to dominate the recommendations of governance literature and codes. Our findings have implications for both research and practice.</p>"

<p>This essay discusses the strength and weaknesses of the so-called linear model (LM) of innovation. It is a reaction to the habit of criticising it as over simplistic, mechanistic, or simply blatantly wrong. We argue that, while some criticisms are of course well grounded, many others are instead based on loose interpretations and unwarranted assumptions. In order to separate the wheat from the chaff, this essay first presents a comprehensive description of the linear model and differentiates it from the caricature many refer to. Second, we discuss the main criticisms put forward and argue that many of them are not at all destructive, but can be easily accepted within a refined version of the LM. Third, we discuss the policy implications often derived (or said to derive) from the LM to argue that the LM itself is distinctively policy-neutral. Other assumptions have to be added to justify alternative policy implications. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>The paper provides an exploratory analysis of the research networks linking scientists working in an open science environment, and researchers involved in the private technology domain. The study combines data on scientific co-authorship with data on patent co-invention, at the level of individual researchers, for three science-intensive technology fields, i.e. lasers, semiconductors and biotechnology, in order to assess the extent of the overlap between the two communities and to identify the role of key individuals in the process of knowledge transfer. Our findings reveal that the extent of the connectedness among scientists and inventors is rather large, and that particular individuals, i.e. authors-inventors, who act as gatekeepers and bridge the boundaries between the two domains, are fundamental to ensuring this connectivity. These individuals tend to occupy prominent positions in the scientific and the technological networks. However, Our results also show maintaining a very central position in the scientific network may come at the expense of being able to fill a similarly central position in a technological network (and vice versa). Finally, preliminary analysis of the institutional origins of authors-inventors shows that one characteristic, distinctive of Europe compared to the United States, is associated with the relatively lower involvement of corporate scientists at the intersection between the two worlds of science and technology.

<p>CSR (case study research) is extensively used in BtoB marketing research. Over the last few years, the debate on the use of CSR has normally concentrated on the validity of the method and the way in which CSR is undertaken, although the question of representation has not really been discussed. There are actually many ways of representing these same observed phenomena and, consequently, the representation of results has an important impact on another aspect such as the extent to which an audience finds a case and its implications attractive and convincing. Conventionally, CSR results are represented in BtoB marketing research through a description and narration of the case, the use of protagonists' verbatim and narratives as well as the use of graphics, tables, and figures. We propose the introduction of videography to provide a richer representation of reality, which is seductive, and supports theory building. Videography is a form of visual anthropology encompassing the collection, analysis, and presentation of visual data: it has the potential to rejuvenate case study research developed for BtoB marketing purposes. Videography provides a representation of CSR research in the form of an edited film that its audience could experience as compelling and fascinating. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

Second, the paper envisions the quality of the knowledge generated through the ECS inquiry, and argues that the methodological peculiarities of this approach may help reduce the relevance gap affecting business research. The systematic cooperation between researchers and practitioners along the ECS phases may benefit relevance through (i) the fine tuning of reciprocal expectations, (ii) the sharing of the research experience, (iii) the multiplication of the beneficiaries of the findings granted by ECS, and (iv) the participation in the process of knowledge dissemination. In this light, the ECS model supports the convincement that methods are not only a way to theory validation but also to theory discovery. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Theory, method and empirical phenomena are the three cornerstones of research. In this paper we contemplate the interplay between them when case research in industrial marketing is concerned. Developments in research depend on what empirical phenomena we are able to capture, how theories are developed to understand and explain these phenomena and what methods we use and/or develop in the process. While the emphasis is often put on one of these aspects alone, this paper focuses on the links and interplay between theory, case method and empirical phenomena in the development of research in industrial marketing. Specifically, we seek to provide common ground between orthodox (deductive) and unorthodox (abductive) approaches to managing the interplay by making a pragmatic call for transparency in research procedures. In this endeavour we use the papers included in this special issue as examples of various aspects of this interplay. We conclude by suggesting that there is a gamut of approaches possible to case research in industrial marketing, each with its specific links to theory and empirical phenomena, and that this is promising for the development of research in the field, as long as it helps reduce, rather than increase, the complexity of the case studied.

<p>Purpose - This paper seeks to explore drivers and consequences of customer trust in the salesperson in the financial services industry Its theoretical foundations are based on literature on customers' interpersonal relationships with salespeople and front-line employees, as well as on literature in the area of customer trust</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model, specifying a set of hypotheses linking a salesperson's behaviours to customer trust, and the latter to behavioural loyalty intentions, was tested using partial least squares (PI-S) on a sample of 150 customers in the Italian banking industry Multiple models were compared in order to evaluate the mediating role of customer trust</p>
<p>Findings - The results of the empirical study show that both salesperson's customer orientation and expertise positively Influence customer trust in the salesperson Conversely. selling orientation has a negative impact on it Moreover, a salesperson's likeability does not influence. customer trust Finally, trust in the salesperson positively influences a customer's intentions to re-buy/cross-buy and to recommend, while it decrease,, a customer's intention to switch to competitors Research limitations/implications - The study suggests that different relational antecedents may have different impacts on different relational mediators and outcomes Since the mechanisms of Interpersonal relationship formation and development are multifaceted, to understand fully the complexity of relational phenomena researchers should develop and test models incorporating multiple relational antecedents and outcomes</p>
<p>Practical implications - The study provides sales managers with some evidence of the behaviours; that salespeople should adopt to influence successfully the creation of long-term relationships, especially in the context of ""credence"" services The findings suggest that the optimal behaviours salespeople may vary, depending on the ultimate goal of the sellers' relational strategy The authors suggest drivers that managers can leverage to stimulate salespeople to perforin the desired behaviours</p>
<p>Originality/value - The model tested in the empirical study highlights the mediating role of customer trust and incorporates a broad set of drivers and consequences of interpersonal trust As Such, it improves knowledge of trust-budding processes in the context of credence services, where trust and interpersonal relationships are very relevant</p>"

<p>In the management of complex systems, knowledge of how components contribute to system performance is essential to the correct allocation of resources. Recent works have renewed interest in the properties of the joint (J) and differential (D) reliability importance measures. However, a common background for these importance measures has not been developed yet. In this work, we build a unified framework for the utilization of J and D in both coherent and non-coherent systems. We show that the reliability function of any system is multilinear and its Taylor expansion is exact at an order T. We then introduce a total order importance measure (D-T) that coincides with the exact portion of the change in system reliability associated with any (finite or infinitesimal) change in component reliabilities. We show that D-T synthesizes the Birnbaum, joint and differential importance of all orders in one unique indicator. We propose an algorithm that enables the numerical estimation of D-T by varying one probability at a time, making it suitable in the analysis of complex systems. Findings demonstrate that the simultaneous utilization of D-T and J provides reliability analysts with a complete dissection of system performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

Secondly, albeit distinct driving forces for real activity and financial factors can be pointed out, sizeable global interactions are also evident. In particular, global supply-side shocks are an important determinant of G-7 house prices fluctuations. The linkage between real housing prices and macroeconomic developments is however bidirectional, with investment showing in general a stronger reaction than consumption and output to housing price shocks.

<p>In risk analysis problems, the decision-making process is supported by the utilization of quantitative models. Assessing the relevance of interactions is an essential information in the interpretation of model results. By such knowledge, analysts and decisionmakers are able to understand whether risk is apportioned by individual factor contributions or by their joint action. However, models are oftentimes large, requiring a high number of input parameters, and complex, with individual model runs being time consuming. Computational complexity leads analysts to utilize one-parameter-at-a-time sensitivity methods, which prevent one from assessing interactions. In this work, we illustrate a methodology to quantify interactions in probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) models by varying one parameter at a time. The method is based on a property of the functional ANOVA decomposition of a finite change that allows to exactly determine the relevance of factors when considered individually or together with their interactions with all other factors. A set of test cases illustrates the technique. We apply the methodology to the analysis of the core damage frequency of the large loss of coolant accident of a nuclear reactor. Numerical results reveal the nonadditive model structure, allow to quantify the relevance of interactions, and to identify the direction of change (increase or decrease in risk) implied by individual factor variations and by their cooperation.</p>"

By reporting several case examples from our cross-national qualitative data, we illustrate these orientations and analyse how they affect the behavior of project business companies. Finally we discuss them in the light of the existing project marketing concepts and propose new directions for project marketing research in order to keep up with these changing orientations.

<p>This paper expands the organization theory and evidence on regional industrial agglomerations. We define regional economic activities according to the attributes of the organizations that populate a region and investigate how organizational characteristics influence macro-outcomes at a regional economic level. We focus on two dimensions emerging from two widely known organizational forms: the managerial corporation and the knowledge cluster with a marked orientation toward interfirm knowledge spillovers. We use an original data set of 146 U. S. cities to obtain variations in the extent to which they are populated by managerial firms or knowledge clusters. By utilizing city-level measures of managerial salaries, we test how the intensity of managerial corporation versus knowledge cluster characteristics affects the mean and dispersion of the ""rewards"" of cities. Our evidence suggests that higher managerial corporate characteristics lower the variability of rewards, while they have no effect on the mean of rewards. Higher-knowledge cluster characteristics produce both higher dispersion and higher expected rewards. We explain these results by looking at the different learning mechanisms of the two organizational types. In so doing, we highlight the role of intra- and interfirm knowledge processes as important sources of differences in the rewards of the two models. From an empirical point of view, results are confirmed using both patent-based and skill mobility-based measures of knowledge spillovers.</p>"

A strong heterogeneity of studies emerged from the evidence.

<p>Product innovation research has matured substantially in the last two decades. A great deal of knowledge has been produced on various aspects of the discipline, so it is of interest to assess the state of the art the scientific community has reached in this discipline and the route it has taken. This perspective is investigated through a bibliometric study of the Journal of Product Innovation Management (JPIM), arguably the most important specialized journal on this topic. The work reviews all journal paper contributions in JPIM from 1984 to 2004 in determined time frames, assesses the citations contained in these papers, identifies how the citations are related to the various topics of production innovation research (topic-related citation variety, topic-related citation consistency, variation in topic-related citation pattern), and offers a retrospective examination of the evolution of the field. The overall analysis of citations shows that most papers in JPIM cite at least one of the top 50 works identified by this study. This testifies to the strong impact of the most influential works on the intellectual structure of product innovation research. The observed citation pattern suggests that the top 50 papers gained influence in product innovation research either because they represent a relevant contribution on a fundamental topic that already has been authoritatively studied or because they investigate in a relevant manner a new topic. The paper suggests that JPIM might benefit in its aim to consolidate its position as one of the top academic business journals if published papers increasingly drew on the most influential works to inform their research design and explicitly stated the theoretical underpinnings they draw on in their research design. Overall, the analysis of the subperiods (1984-1988, 1989-1993, 1994-1998, and 1999-2004) provides evidence for the maturation of new product innovation research. Books covering a wide range of topics are replaced by journal papers addressing a specific topic; over time, specific topics emerge and become influential for the discipline's intellectual structure; papers published in JPIM augment their methodological rigor and increasingly address contingency factors. The paper also notes that obtaining relevance for JPIM authors constitutes a necessary condition for being considered by management researchers at large as an influential contribution to product innovation research.</p>"

This article questions and qualifies this line of argument on the basis of a newly reported case of public management reform that endured for more than 10 years. The study tracks and explains the emergence of the policy issue of ""government innovation"" and its persistence on the specialized policy agenda of the Ministry for Public Administration. The initial emergence of the government innovation policy in Italy and its directional stability is explained by applying event-centric approaches to historical analysis, together with the institutional concept of policy subsystems.

<p>CUSMANO L., MANCUSI M. L. and MORRISON A. Globalization of production and innovation: how outsourcing is reshaping an advanced manufacturing area, Regional Studies. This paper investigates the determinants and the spatial and functional dimensions of firms' outsourcing. Based on a large survey of manufacturing firms in Lombardy, Italy, the analysis shows that outsourcing is remarkably wide across sectors and has a clear regional dimension, concerning highly skilled firms at most. Offshoring is still a minor fraction of the deverticalization process, largely related to wider strategies of internationalization by foreign group subsidiaries at intermediate stages of the value chain. The evidence suggests the regional system is inserting onto global knowledge networks, but also points at the risk of 'branch plant effects' in high-technology segments.</p>"

<p>We investigate the how and why of performance fee provisions in a free contracting environment such as the Italian mutual fund market until 2006. We find weak support for the hypothesis that these provisions emerge as an economically efficient solution in a rational asset management industry plagued by asymmetric information. They appear to emerge mainly as the product of strategic pricing by asset managers wishing to ease market competition, leverage on investors' sentiment, and hedge their cost structure. Alternatively, fears that managers may opportunistically alter funds' investment policies to maximize the option value embedded in the incentive provisions appear unjustified.</p>"

Business managers coordinated functions and corporate managers allocated resources. This article studies the impact of corporate management on capital allocation decisions by comparing investment behavior in multi- and single-business companies. Using a new taxonomy to control for the quality of each business unit, we analyze a cross-sectional sample of U.S. companies and identify a number of empirical regularities that highlight the allocative decisions of corporate management. In particular, we find that, when dealing with cash-needy businesses, multi-business firms invest more intensively in those that are less profitable. We find no evidence that this subsidy results in a higher success rate in making those businesses profitable over time. We suggest a number of explanations for this empirical pattern.</p>"

(2) Are spillover effects more likely to occur within or across sectors? (3) Are the existence, the direction and the magnitude of spillovers conditioned by sector and firm-specific characteristics? Our findings show that FDI spillovers exist both within and across sectors. The former arise when foreign firms operate in labour-intensive sectors, while the latter occur when foreign firms operate in high-tech sectors. Moreover, we find that domestic firm size conditions the exploitation of FDI spillovers even after controlling for absorptive capacity.

<p>In the context of decision under uncertainty, we propose axioms that the two notions of rationality might satisfy. These axioms allow a joint representation by a single set of prior probabilities and a single utility index. It is ""objectively rational"" to choose f in the presence of g if and only if the expected utility of f is at least as high as that of g given each and every prior in the set. It is ""subjectively rational"" to choose f rather than g if and only if the minimal expected utility of f (with respect to all priors in the set) is at least as high as that of g. In other words, the objective and subjective rationality relations admit, respectively, a representation a la Bewley (2002) and a la Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989). Our results thus provide a bridge between these two classic models, as well as a novel foundation for the latter.</p>"

<p>The collection of personal information from customers is a necessity for Internet merchants, who need such information to effectively provide service to customers. The ease with which data can be acquired and disseminated across the Web, and the peculiarities of the electronic environment have led to growing concerns from many potential customers over disclosing personal information to e-service providers. Self-disclosure theories suggest that consumers' willingness to disclose personal information is based on their assessments of the related costs, risks, and benefits. This study experimentally manipulated initial trust and the nature of the incentive given to encourage information disclosure. It also measured actual disclosure behavior rather than just intention or attitude. A key finding is that subjects did not claim to be more willing to provide information in the presence of incentives, but in fact, as indicated by their behavior, were more inclined to do so. What is more, privacy concern, involvement with the service category considered, and attitude toward on-line shopping act like antecedents for a willingness to share attitudinal measure but are not diagnostic of actual behavior.</p>"

<p>The paper explores the determinants of yield differentials between sovereign bonds, using euro-area data. There is a common trend in yield differentials, which is correlated with a measure of aggregate risk. In contrast, liquidity differentials display sizeable heterogeneity and no common factor. We propose a simple model with endogenous liquidity demand, where a bond's liquidity premium depends both on its transaction cost and on investment opportunities. The model predicts that yield differentials should increase in both liquidity and risk, with an interaction term of the opposite sign. Testing these predictions on daily data, we find that the aggregate risk factor is consistently priced, liquidity differentials are priced for a subset of countries, and their interaction with the risk factor is in line with the model's prediction and crucial to detect their effect.</p>"

<p>The available empirical evidence on the wage effect of finding jobs through informal contacts is mixed.

Using data front the European Community Household Panel (ECHP), the author finds new evidence to suggest that across many oldie countries in the European Union, premiums and penalties to finding jobs through personal contacts are equally frequent and arc of about die same size. Such cross-country variation seems to reflect differences in the efficiency of formal search channels. In particular, the wage effect of finding jobs through personal contacts is higher in countries with more labor market intermediaries. Differences-in-differences estimates based on the Italian liberalization of the labor recruitment industry confirm this result.</p>"

A sample of 283 consumers indicates a negative interaction effect between novelty and appropriateness, suggesting that creativity depends on either, according to contingencies. Novelty is more relevant when consumers are highly involved or have little knowledge of the product. Appropriateness is more relevant when consumers are minimally involved or have significant knowledge. Theoretical and managerial implications are provided.</p>"

Prior research on software engineering and human-computer interaction (HCI) has focused considerable attention on the need for a shift in the developer's attitude in dealing with contingencies departing from the original plan, while less emphasis has been placed on the factors that may augment the incidence of the attitude towards extemporaneous action (i.e. improvisation). In an attempt to fill this gap, we theoretically analyse the antecedents of individual attitude toward improvisation, grounding our theoretical framework on the ISD domain.</p>"

<p>P>This paper studies the distribution of the classical t-ratio with data generated from distributions with no finite moments and shows how classical testing is affected by bimodality. A key condition in generating bimodality is independence of the observations in the underlying data-generating process (DGP). The paper highlights the strikingly different implications of lack of correlation versus statistical independence in DGPs with infinite moments and shows how standard inference can be invalidated in such cases, thereby pointing to the need for adapting estimation and inference procedures to the special problems induced by thick-tailed (TT) distributions. The paper presents theoretical results for the Cauchy case and develops a new distribution termed the 'double-Pareto', which allows the thickness of the tails and the existence of moments to be determined parametrically. It also investigates the relative importance of tail thickness in case of finite moments by using TT distributions truncated on a compact support, showing that bimodality can persist even in such cases. Simulation results highlight the dangers of relying on naive testing in the face of TT distributions. Novel density estimation kernel methods are employed, given that our theoretical results yield cases that exhibit density discontinuities.</p>"

<p>Background: The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has been introduced in national immunisation programmes of most industrialised countries and recently in two African GAVI eligible countries (Rwanda and The Gambia). However the long term effects of PCV are still unclear, as beneficial direct and herd immunity effects might be countered by serotype replacement.</p>
<p>Method: A dynamic, age-structured, compartmental model of Streptococcus pneumoniae transmission was developed to predict the potential impact of PCV7 on the incidence of invasive disease accounting for both herd immunity and serotype replacement effects. The model was parameterised using epidemiological data from England and Wales and pre and post-vaccination surveillance data from the US.</p>
<p>Results: Model projections showed that serotype replacement plays a crucial role in determining the overall effect of a PCV7 vaccination programme and could reduce, negate or outweigh its beneficial impact. However, using the estimate of the competition parameter derived from the US post-vaccination experience, an infant vaccination programme would prevent 39,000 IPD cases in the 20 years after PCV7 introduction in the UK. Adding a catch-up campaign for under 2 or under 5 year olds would provide a further reduction of 1,200 or 3,300 IPD cases respectively, mostly in the first few years of the programme.</p>
<p>Conclusions: This analysis suggests that a PCV vaccination programme would eradicate vaccine serotypes from circulation. However, the increase in carriage of non-vaccine serotypes, and the consequent increase in invasive disease, could reduce, negate or outweigh the benefit. These results are sensitive to changes in the protective effect of the vaccine, and, most importantly, to the level of competition between vaccine and non-vaccine types. The techniques developed here can be used to assess the introduction of vaccination programmes in developing countries and provide the basis for cost-effectiveness analyses.</p>"

<p>In this paper we simulate carriers' capacity allocation practices in order to investigate the role of fences and forecasting for maintaining high load factor levels and returns in oligopolistic airline markets. We analyse the case where firms apply a well-established revenue management heuristic, called the expected marginal seat revenue rule, extending the original set-up provided by Belobaba (1989) to account for different levels of forecasting, segmentation, and passenger participation. Substantial differences in terms of revenue and load factor emerge and a key role is played by fences.</p>"

<p>We build upon previous work on the effects of deviations in CEO pay from labor markets to assess how overcompensation or undercompensation affects subsequent voluntary CEO withdrawal, firm size, and firm profitability, taking into account the moderating effect of firm ownership structure. We find that CEO underpayment is related to changes in firm size and CEO withdrawal, and that the relationship between CEO underpayment and CEO withdrawal is stronger in owner-controlled firms. We also show that when CEOs are overpaid, there is higher firm profitability; a relationship that is weaker among manager-controlled firms. We then discuss the implications that these findings have for Mitre research. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>The demographic effects of the epidemics of plague in Early Modern Europe and their economic consequences illuminate the evolution of property structures and of wealth distribution during and after a mortality crisis. An analysis of the high-quality data available for the Italian city of Ivrea at the time of the 1630 plague shows the exceptional resilience of property structures. Like the social structures of the period, property structures were able to recover quickly, informed as they were by the lessons learnt by trial and error by the patrician families of the late Middle Ages, whose patrimonies had been badly damaged by the Black Death. In a period of recurrent catastrophes that struck European populations during the Old Demographic Regime, apparently 'inegalitarian' institutions seem to have had long-term 'egalitarian' effects.</p>"

<p>Using data from Italian municipalities, nonprofits, and business firms, this article explores two sets of relationships. First, sectoral differences in the exposure to institutional forces triggering the adoption of performance-related pay are investigated. Second, this study estimates sectoral differences in the sensitivity to those isomorphic pressures. Coercive pressure is the strongest on municipalities and the weakest on for-profits. Exposition to mimetic pressure tends to be stronger for business establishments compared with both municipalities and nonprofits. For-profits generally face weaker normative forces relative to municipalities and nonprofits. Coercive pressure increases the probability that an organization adopts performance-related pay schemes more in business firms than in nonprofits and more in nonprofits than in municipalities. The effect of normative pressure on the probability of adoption is higher in both municipalities and nonprofits compared with for-profit establishments. Coercive pressure increases the percentage of performance-related pay more in business firms than in nonprofits and more in nonprofits than in municipalities.</p>"

<p>The present study aims to evaluate the impact of cost-effectiveness information on clinical decision making using discrete choice experiment (DCE) methodology. Data were collected through a self-completed questionnaire administered to Italian cardiologists in June 2007 (n = 129 respondents, 1143 observations). The questionnaire asked clinicians to make choices between paired scenarios, across which three key dimensions were identified and varied: (1) quality of clinical evidence, (2) size of health gain (reduction of relative and absolute risk), and (3) economic impact (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio). A random effects probit model was used to estimate clinicians' preferences for the different dimensions, while the heterogeneity of preferences was tested in a model with interaction terms. Dominance tests were used to assess the consistency of responses. The results indicate that Italian cardiologists regard economic impact (cost-effectiveness) as an important factor in their decision making. Economic evidence is valued more highly among clinicians with a higher self-assessed level of knowledge regarding economic evaluation techniques, as well as among younger professionals (age<45). While relevant study limitations should be acknowledged, our results suggest that DCEs can be used to elicit clinicians' decision-making criteria and to inform the allocation of resources for future research in a logical manner. Italian cardiologists appear to take cost-effectiveness information into account when deciding whether to use new treatments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Does culture have a causal effect on economic development? The data on European regions suggest that it does. Culture is measured by indicators of individual values and beliefs, such as trust and respect for others, and confidence in individual self determination. To isolate the exogenous variation in culture, we rely on two historical variables used as instruments: the literacy rate at the end of the 19th century, and the political institutions in place over the past several centuries. The political and social history of Europe provides a rich source of variation in these two variables at a regional level. The exogenous component of culture due to history is strongly correlated with current regional economic development, after controlling for contemporaneous education, urbanization rates around 1850, and national effects.

<p>This paper addresses the role of mobility costs in shaping the effects of trade integration on wage inequality and welfare. We present a three-factor, two-sector model in which the production technology exhibits capital-skill complementarity and the cost of moving across sectors differs between unskilled and skilled workers. Results show that trade integration increases aggregate welfare, but it also raises wage inequality, both within and across skill categories. We also model a public re-training program, financed by a proportional tax levied on skilled workers, which reduces the mobility cost of unskilled workers. We show that even if the re-training programme entails some welfare losses, it can reduce both within and between wage inequality, while still making free trade Pareto superior with respect to the no-trade regime.</p>"

<p>Despite recent attention to closed-loop supply chains and remanufacturing, there is scant information about what drives the re-make versus buy decision for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) engaging in remanufacturing. Based on the extant remanufacturing literature and transaction cost economics, we formulated hypotheses related to the drivers of in-house versus contracted remanufacturing operations. The hypotheses were investigated via quantitative and qualitative data, thus offering a rich test of the formulated relationships. Consistent with the theory, the quantitative results showed that intellectual property, operational assets, and remanufacturing frequency are significant drivers of the re-make versus buy decision. However, counter to the theory, the quantitative results did not support the significance of brand reputation, technological uncertainty, condition uncertainty, product complexity, and volume uncertainty. The qualitative results were used to enrich these findings by providing theoretical extensions and pragmatic insights of the remake versus buy decision in remanufacturing.</p>"

<p>Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) is an increasingly widely-diffused practice among companies that are seeking to improve their environmental performance. The motivation for the introduction of GSCM may be ethical (e.g., reflecting the values of managers) and/or commercial (e.g., gaining a possible competitive advantage by signalling environmental concern). Drawing upon a database of over 4000 manufacturing facilities in seven OECD countries this paper assesses the determinants and motivations for the implementation of GSCM. We find that GSCM is strongly complementary with other advanced management practices, and that it contributes to improved environmental performance. The effects on commercial performance are more ambiguous. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>A path forecast refers to the sequence of forecasts 1 to H periods into the future. A summary of the range of possible paths the predicted variable may follow for a given confidence level requires construction of simultaneous confidence regions that adjust for any covariance between the elements of the path forecast. This paper shows how to construct such regions with the joint predictive density and Scheffe's S-method of 1953. In addition, the joint predictive density can be used to construct simple statistics to evaluate the local internal consistency of a forecasting exercise of a system of variables. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that these simultaneous confidence regions provide approximately correct coverage in situations where traditional error bands, based on the collection of marginal predictive densities for each horizon, are vastly off the mark. The paper showcases these methods with an application to the most recent monetary episode of interest rate hikes in the US macroeconomy. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

In their archetypical format, these general-purpose technologies are constructed in ways that can be employed by different potential downstream licensees, and can accommodate their different strategies. This strengthens the hand of innovative firms in the rising markets for knowledge-based assets, and can be expected to improve their ability to capture a greater share of the value their technology creates. The innovation of business model designed for licensing such technologies will have unpredictable, but inevitable, consequences for industry structure and organizational capabilities, as well as for the content and context for the upstream science.

<p>In this article we estimate the wage and employment effects of recent immigration in Western Germany. Using administrative data for the period 1987-2001 and a labor-market equilibrium model, we find that the substantial immigration of the 1990s had very little adverse effects on native wages and on their employment levels. Instead, it had a sizeable adverse employment effect on previous immigrants as well as a small adverse effect on their wages. These asymmetric results are partly driven by a higher degree of substitution between old and new immigrants in the labor market and in part by the rigidity of wages in less than flexible labor markets. In a simple counter-factual experiment we show that in a world of perfect wage flexibility and no unemployment insurance the wage-bill loss of old immigrants would be much smaller.

<p>Background: Information system integration is an important dimension of a company's information system maturity and plays a relevant role in meeting information needs and accountability targets. However, no generalizable evidence exists about whether and how the main integrating technologies influence information system integration in health care organizations.</p>
<p>Purpose: This study examined how integrating technologies are adopted in public health care organizations and chief information officers' (CIOs) perceptions about their influence on information system integration.</p>
<p>Methodology: We used primary data on integrating technologies' adoption and CIOs' perception regarding information system integration in public health care organizations. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multinomial logistic regression were used to examine the relationship between CIOs' perception about information system integration and the adopted technologies.</p>
<p>Results: Data from 90 health care organizations were available for analyses. Integrating technologies are relatively diffused in public health care organizations, and CIOs seem to shape information system toward integrated architectures. There is a significant positive (although modest, .3) correlation between the number of integrating technologies adopted and the CIO's satisfaction with them. However, regression analysis suggests that organizations covering a broader spectrum of these technologies are less likely to have their CIO reporting main problems concerning integration in the administrative area of the information system compared with the clinical area and where the two areas overlap.</p>
<p>Practice Implications: Integrating technologies are associated with less perceived problems in the information system administrative area rather than in other areas. Because CIOs play the role of information resource allocators, by influencing information system toward integrated architecture, health care organization leaders should foster cooperation between CIOs and medical staff to enhance information system integration.</p>"

<p>The aim of this paper is to provide an extension of a technique recently introduced by Pyatt and Round (2006) to decompose each element of the 'global multiplier matrix' in 'microscopic detail' in order to capture the linkages between each household groups' income and the exogenously injected income of other accounts. The methodology we propose allows dividing the impact of exogenous injections into four different effects: direct-direct effect (D-D); direct-indirect effect (D-I); indirect-direct effect (I-D) and indirect-indirect effect (I-I). Results using the 2000 Vietnamese SAM show that the highest direct effects on the income of household groups are related to exogenous injections into the agricultural sector, while the highest indirect effects result from investing in other agriculture-related sectors such as, for example, food processing. Policy interventions focusing on the agricultural sector and on rural households will thus have the greatest effect on reducing the level of income inequality.</p>"

<p>In this article, we merge two strands from the recent econometric literature. First, factor models based on large sets of macroeconomic variables for forecasting, which have generally proven useful for forecasting. However, there is some disagreement in the literature as to the appropriate method. Second, forecast methods based on mixed-frequency data sampling (MIDAS). This regression technique can take into account unbalanced datasets that emerge from publication lags of high- and low-frequency indicators, a problem practitioner have to cope with in real time. In this article, we introduce Factor MIDAS, an approach for nowcasting and forecasting low-frequency variables like gross domestic product (GDP) exploiting information in a large set of higher-frequency indicators. We consider three alternative MIDAS approaches (basic, smoothed and unrestricted) that provide harmonized projection methods that allow for a comparison of the alternative factor estimation methods with respect to nowcasting and forecasting. Common to all the factor estimation methods employed here is that they can handle unbalanced datasets, as typically faced in real-time forecast applications owing to publication lags. In particular, we focus on variants of static and dynamic principal components as well as Kalman filter estimates in state-space factor models. As an empirical illustration of the technique, we use a large monthly dataset of the German economy to nowcast and forecast quarterly GDP growth. We find that the factor estimation methods do not differ substantially, whereas the most parsimonious MIDAS projection performs best overall. Finally, quarterly models are in general outperformed by the Factor MIDAS models, which confirms the usefulness of the mixed-frequency techniques that can exploit timely information from business cycle indicators.</p>"

This paper provides new empirical evidence and, in particular, looks at the importance of researchers' individual characteristics and their institutional environments in explaining the propensity to engage in different types of U-I linkages. Based on an original dataset, we present new evidence on three wine producing areas - Piedmont, a region of Italy, Chile and South Africa - that have successfully responded to recent structural changes in the industry worldwide. Empirical findings reveal that researchers' individual characteristics, such as centrality in the academic system, age and sex, matter more than publishing records or formal degrees. Institutional specificities at country level also play a role in shaping the propensity of researchers to engage with industry. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate business visitor behaviour at trade shows and to propose a complementary view based on the experiential perspective in marketing.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - The paper reports an ethnographic study conducted in the context of ten international trade shows in the textile-apparel industry in Europe.</p>
<p>Findings - The study sheds light on the nature of the experience provided by trade show exhibitors and organisers and on visitors' lived experiences. Trade shows immerse industrial buyers in a physical and cognitive experience that requires their active participation. Under such circumstances, industrial marketers who employ experiential marketing techniques are likely to increase their trade show performances.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The paper adopts a new perspective that sees business visitor behaviour from an experiential standpoint and discusses the managerial implications that highlight the interplay of exhibitors and trade show organisers in designing and setting valuable experiences for visitors.</p>"

<p>A fundamental aspect in the regulation of the continuity of electricity supply is the identification of faults that could be caused by an exceptional event and, therefore, that are outside the utility control and responsibility. Different methods have been proposed during the years: the interpretation of the observed faults as a signal of an underlying system naturally leads to the analysis of the problem by means of a hidden Markov model. These models, in fact, are widely used for introducing dependence in data and/or for modeling observed phenomena depending on hidden processes. The application of this method shows that the model is able to identify exceptional events; moreover, the study of the estimated model parameters gives rise to reality-linked considerations.</p>"

<p>This paper presents a review of the methods of the science of networks with an application to the field of tourism studies. The basic definitions and computational techniques are described and a case study (Elba, Italy) used to illustrate the effect of network typology on information diffusion. A static structural characterization of the network formed by destination stakeholders is derived from stakeholder interviews and website link analysis. This is followed by a dynamic analysis of the information diffusion process within the case destination demonstrating that stakeholder cohesion and adaptive capacity have a positive effect on information diffusion. The outcomes and the implications of this analysis for improving destination management are discussed.</p>"

<p>This article surveys some of the recent literature on technology markets, and summarizes its main issues and insights. We structure our analysis in three parts: the supply and demand of technology; the factors that condition the formation and growth of technology markets; industry structure and dynamic issues. In addition, we summarize some of the studies that have tried to document the size and growth of these markets. We find that the literature has focused mainly on the supply of technology, but several other aspects of these markets remain under-studied, including the demand for external technology, the role of uncertainty in technology markets, and the dynamic interaction between industry structure and the market for technology. Understanding these will illuminate whether markets for technology will continue to grow or remained confined to pockets of the economy.</p>"

<p>The market for technology plays a crucial role in firms technology strategy as a way to undertake search in the available technological space. Drawing on innovation search theory and the literatures on licensing and absorptive capacity (AC) we address the issue of the factors that affect how technologically distant from the existing technological portfolio in-licensing firms are able to move when they in-license externally developed technologies. We posit that a long technological distance reflects the outcome of more exploratory search, while a short distance reflects the outcome of exploitative search. We conjecture two distinct dimensions of AC in terms of the firms' stock of knowledge (""assimilation capacity"") and the degree to which firms have searched broadly in the past (""monitoring ability"") to affect the distance of exploration from the existing technological portfolio. Furthermore, we compare firms that explore through licensing and firms which do not explore through licensing, but do so through search reflected in own patenting activities. We propose that the effects of assimilation capacity and monitoring ability should be more pronounced for licensees. Combining data on 176 license agreements and related patent information and while using a control sample of non-licensing firms we find-with exceptions-support for these ideas.</p>"

<p>This article carries a broad definition of public-private concertation as a flexible form of governance that is able to overcome the distinction between network governance and participatory governance. It creates a unified framework relying on a process-related democratic approach in order to properly assess these practices in their democratic outcomes. This allows the article to fully depict how local governance arrangements affect local democracy, both positively and negatively. Drawing on four exemplary cases of urban policies developed in the Province of Milan, it highlights two variables that give account of the democratic implication of these practices: the role of the political leadership and the inclusive strategy that they adopt. Moreover, it underlines four additional factors that help more democratic outcomes: presence of cognitive justification, quality of participation, active opposition, and an outward communication.</p>"

<p>According to recent and largely untested theories, unemployment benefits (UBs) could improve the extent and quality of job reallocation even at the cost of increasing unemployment. In this paper, we use a new set of yearly panel data from a large number of countries to evaluate empirically the relationship between unemployment benefits and job reallocation. Unlike previous work assessing the effects of UBs on labor market stocks, we focus on flows and rely on policy ""experiments,"" notably the introduction from scratch of unemployment benefits in many countries. We exploit the longitudinal nature of our data to lessen the potentially important selection, endogeneity, and omitted variable problems. We find a positive, sizable, and significant effect of the introduction of UBs on job reallocation, arising mainly from the job destruction margin although this effect fades away over time. These findings appear to be robust to changes in the countries in the sample, control variables or estimation methods. We discuss to what extent our results are consistent with equilibrium matching models with or without endogenous sorting of workers into jobs providing entitlement to UBs and stochastic job matching.

<p>Every new product development (NPD) team learns a unique set of lessons in solving the many problems that arise in a typical project, and it is important to ensure that these lessons are shared. Since much of the learning is tacit in nature, it is difficult to articulate, to capture, and to disseminate. Therefore, managers face a challenge in trying to stimulate project-to-project learning. Many companies hold post-project reviews (PPRs)-meetings at the end of projects to determine the lessons learned and document them for the future. However discussing a project, noting down the lessons learned, and entering them into a database is not sufficient. Our research at five leading German companies shows' that written reports fail to convey much of the key learning from NPD teams and so managers need to focus on stimulating individual learning and running PPRs in specific ways to generate and transfer tacit knowledge. Managers also need to integrate PPRs with other mechanisms, such as mentoring schemes and knowledge brokering, to stimulate the flow of lessons learned and tacit knowledge.</p>"

Transaction Costs Economics has mainly debated the attributes of the technology involved in production and the required investments. In this article, considerations on the organizational nature of the actors participating in the process are added to this framework, pointing out that features of the internal structure and of the external mode of social control of organizational forms make them more suitable for providing certain services rather than others. The model is based on two dimensions: incentives power and authority types.

<p>The present research extends prior work on the relationship between users and technology by examining users' intention to explore a technology. Drawing on exploration and individual motivation theories, we developed and tested a model examining the effects of hedonic (i.e., personal innovativeness and cognitive absorption) and instrumental (i.e., performance expectancy and image enhancement) factors on individuals' intentions to explore a technology over time. Based on a study of 94 users exposed to a new technology, with measurements taken at two points in time, we found that both instrumental and hedonic factors affect individuals' intentions to explore, but their effects change over time such that as time goes by, the effect of personal innovativeness decreases and performance expectancy increases. In addition to our contributions and implications for research on technology acceptance, we present practical implications both for developers and managers, with a view toward helping the development and deployment of technologies that satisfy the evolution of users' needs over time.

<p>Background: Network forms of organization are increasingly popular in primary care.

<p>Methods: Administrative data of a Local Health Authority in Central Italy were analyzed using statistical methods at individual and dyadic levels of analysis.</p>
<p>Results: Homophily factors seem to influence a GP's choice of network. The consequences of network membership on GP performances seem very limited.</p>
<p>Conclusions: When considering to foster the diffusion of network organizational forms in health care creating a network structure, like that of Italian GPs, is not sufficient. Other features of the implementation phase, work organization and human resource management should also be considered.</p>"

<p>The aim of this study was to examine TOP2A gene copy number changes as a means to identify groups of breast cancer patients with superior benefit from treatment with anthracyclines. Tumour tissue was retrospectively collected and successfully analysed for TOP2A in 773 of 980 Danish patients randomly assigned to receive intravenous CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil) or CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin and fluorouracil) in DBCG trial 89D. Subgroup analyses on this material published by Knoop et al. (J Clin Oncol 23:7483-7490, 2005) and updated by Nielsen et al. (Acta Oncol 47:725-734, 2008) demonstrated that superiority of CEF over CMF is limited to patients with TOP2A aberrations, defined as patients whose tumours have TOP2A ratio below 0.8 or above 2.0. The Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot (STEPP) technique was applied to these data to explore the pattern of treatment effect relative to TOP2A and to compare that pattern to the ranges previously used to define 'aberrations'. The pattern of treatment effect illustrated by the STEPP analysis confirmed that the superiority of CEF over CMF is indeed limited to patients whose tumours have high or low TOP2A ratios. The hypothesis of no treatment effect-covariate interaction was rejected (P = 0.02). Furthermore, results indicated that the interval of TOP2A ratios hitherto denoted as 'normal' could be narrower than previously assumed. A more optimal separation of TOP2A subgroups could be obtained by altering cut-points currently used to define TOP2A amplified and TOP2A deleted tumours by narrowing the TOP2A normal interval, and consequently enlarging the population with TOP2A aberrated tumours.</p>"

<p>What factors influence exit from the founder's business and subsequent entrepreneurial renewal in a generational family firm? Guided by this research question, we trace the development of the Italian Falck Group from its inception as a steel company in 1906 - ascension as the largest privately owned steel producer in Italy - losses in the 1970s and 1980s leading to business exit from steel industry in the 1990s - followed by successful entry in the renewable energy business. A combination of insights from the literature and triangulation of data from multiple primary and secondary sources leads to the development of a model describing how inhibitors of exit from the founder's business can be transformed into facilitators of change. The critical role of farsighted 'family champion of continuity' is found central in redirecting the family from its anchoring in past activities to focus on future entrepreneurial endeavours. While the commitment to the founder's business continues, the family champion aided by business savvy and astute non-family executives ably modifies its meaning of 'continuity of the founder's business' from 'steel production' to 'continuity of the entrepreneurial spirit of the family', hence preserving the institutional identity. Insights from this study can help generational family firms which plan to exit from a failing course of action to regenerate so as to create trans-generational value.</p>"

Gould and Fernandez's (1989) taxonomy of 'brokerage' roles is adjusted to patent data, and complemented with information drawn from both academic inventors' publications and replies to a short questionnaire. Only very few academic inventors are found to hold brokerage positions. Such inventors have a large number of patents, a strong publication record and a higher-than-average share of patents held by companies, rather than universities. Relationships of academic inventors with co-inventors from industry are weaker and less likely to be maintained than those with co-inventors from academia. Academic inventors in gatekeeping positions (between university and industry) maintain the strongest ties with all types of co-inventors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Links with science have been argued to improve the (innovation) performance of firms. Yet we still know comparatively little about the project-level characteristics affecting the organization of such links. Our study, based on a sample of 52 projects carried out by a multinational company in the semiconductor industry, reveals that the knowledge attributes of a project help in predicting how the R&D activities will be organized. In particular, basic projects are likely to be developed through formal cooperative agreements with universities. Such projects also tend to be strategically less important. For strategically more important projects, in contrast, and for those where the knowledge to be developed is particularly novel to the firm, the firm is more likely to resort to formal contracting with a university for a specific component of the R&D project, usually early on in the project.

<p>This paper aims to analyse the pricing strategies of mobile communications operators and examine the role of demand characteristics in the development of new tariff plans. In so doing, we depart from a traditional industrial organization approach to price discrimination and interpret new tariff plans as innovations. In the spirit of Schumpeter, we look at competition in this sector as depending upon this form of innovation, and we argue that, given the specific features of the industry, the development of new tariff plans is strongly related to the users' characteristics and behaviour. Our main point is that in a context of uncertainty, demand affects firms' innovative strategies in two ways: first, by providing information on user behaviour and by increasing the capability of market segmentation: and second, by providing the incentives to innovate. This argument is supported by an empirical analysis carried out on the basis of an original dataset which includes all the tariff plans on offer in the history of the Italian market between 1992 and 2005. We find that both a firm's installed customer base and the level of market saturation play a role in shaping firms' innovative pricing strategies, in terms of the number and characteristics of the new tariff plans.

<p>Tourism destinations have a necessity to innovate in order to remain competitive in an increasingly global environment. A pre-requisite for innovation is the understanding of how destinations source, share and use knowledge. This conceptual paper examines the nature of networks and how their analysis can shed light upon the processes of knowledge sharing in destinations as they strive to innovate. The paper conceptualizes destinations as networks of connected organizations, both public and private, each of which can be considered as a destination stakeholder. In network theory, they represent the nodes within the system. The paper shows how epidemic diffusion models can act as analogies for knowledge communication and transfer within a destination network. These models can be combined with other approaches to network analysis to shed light on how destination networks operate, and how they can be optimized with policy intervention to deliver innovative and competitive destinations. The paper closes with a practical tourism example taken from the Italian destination of Elba. Using numerical simulations, the case demonstrates how the Elba network can be optimized. Overall, this paper demonstrates the considerable utility of network analysis for tourism in delivering destination competitiveness.dagger.</p>"

<p>This article studies the parallel creation of complementary innovations serving the upstream and downstream stages of a production chain with the aim of shedding light on the impact of outsourcing on R&D when supply contracts are incomplete. We argue that outsourced upstream production contributes to the emergence of innovation networks by creating a demand for upstream R&D. The bargaining weight of the two parties determines whether outsourcing decisions that lead to static specialization gains also generate dynamic gains when compared with vertically integrated production that relies on integrated R&D. In particular, growth is maximized when the bargaining power is split in a way that search and hold-up frictions are minimized. Putting this result next to the decision of firms to outsource, we conclude that complementary innovations are more likely to foster growth in Schumpeterian Mark I sectors, while vertical integration does so in Schumpeterian Mark II sectors.</p>"

The model incorporates mindfulness and tool utility (positive) effects as well as experience and inertia (negative) effects on dynamic capability. The simulation experiments conducted with the model suggest that the impact of deliberate learning on dynamic capability is non-linear, complex, and in some instances counter-intuitive. This is evident from the thresholds (tipping points) that arise from the differential effects of articulated knowledge, codified knowledge and operating routines on dynamic capability at different levels of environmental dynamism.</p>"

<p>Using data from 708 small and medium Italian firms during the period of 2002-2004, we find that in family firms (FFs) a nonfamily Chief Financial Officer (CFO) drives firm performance in a positive direction. FFs with a nonfamily CFO perform better than both FFs with a family CFO and nonfamily firms. The best performance is achieved when the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is a family member and the CFO is an outsider (nonfamily). An examination of FFs across generations shows that a nonfamily CFO has always a positive effect on firm performance. Our study contributes to the literature on FFs by determining how the presence of a nonfamily CFO has an impact on firm performance. We also contribute to the literature on agency theory by showing that in small FFs: (a) having a family as majority shareholder is not detrimental to firm performance and (b) a nonfamily CFO might serve to mitigate any ineptness of descendant CEOs while retaining ownership and management in the hands of family heirs, thus avoiding the conflict of interest between family ownership and management.</p>"

<p>During the last decade, modularity has attracted the attention of numerous management scholars, and both theoretical and empirical studies on this topic have flourished. However, this broad-based appeal has generated some controversies and ambiguities on how modularity should be defined, measured and used in managerially meaningful ways. This paper reviews the concept of modularity as a design principle of complex systems in management studies. Applying this criterion, 125 studies were selected and classified, grouped according to their prevalent unit of analysis: products, production systems and organizations. Although all these studies are based on Simon's seminal work on the hierarchical and nearly decomposable nature of complex systems (Simon, H.A. (1962). The architecture of complexity. Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 106, 467-482), this paper shows that they offer different definitions, measures and applications of the modularity concept. This review reveals the implicit structure of meanings underlying this literature and emphasizes that ambiguity in definitions and measures impedes rigorous empirical studies capable of understanding the relationship between modularity in product, in production and in organization design. Cautions and directions for future research are discussed.</p>"

<p>In this paper, we discuss how ""cultural capital"" and ""symbolic capital,"" understood as specialized subsets of intangible resources and capabilities, enable firms to achieve valuable strategic positions in ways that are currently underexplored by mainstream strategy literature. We articulate the similarities and differences between cultural and symbolic capital and the intangible assets that have been the focus of mainstream strategy researchers, such as intellectual, social, and reputational capital. Our theoretical arguments build on insights from a number of studies conducted primarily in non-North American settings that have shown how symbolic properties of products create value. We conclude by delineating future avenues of research that strategy scholarship should consider in order to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between intangible resources and capabilities, and value creation.</p>"

<p>Accounting practices in family firms, although displaying evident unique features, have received relatively little attention as distinct from their equivalents in publicly held firms. This may have hampered conceptual advancements in both the accounting and the family business literatures. In this article the authors first assess accounting areas in which the ""family entity"" plays a distinct role and elaborate on important characteristics of these phenomena. They also report evidence suggesting that additional research efforts may illuminate both unresolved issues in the accounting literature and so-far-neglected dimensions of the family business entity. Finally, the authors examine several different avenues for research at the accounting-family business interface and identify common themes among them.</p>"

<p>We estimate the effects of fiscal policy on the labor market in US data. An increase in government spending of 1 percent of GDP generates output and unemployment multipliers, respectively, of about 1.2 percent (at one year) and 0.6 percentage points (at the peak). Each percentage point increase in GDP produces an increase in employment of about 1.3 million jobs. Total hours, employment and the job finding probability all rise, whereas the separation rate falls. A standard neoclassical model augmented with search and matching frictions in the labor market largely fails in reproducing the size of the output multiplier whereas it can produce a realistic unemployment multiplier but only under a special parameterization. Extending the model to strengthen the complementarity in preferences, to include unemployment benefits, real wage rigidity and/or debt financing with distortionary taxation only worsens the picture. New Keynesian features only marginally magnify the size of the multipliers. When complementarity is coupled with price stickiness, however, the magnification effect can be large.

We first examine the choice of hiring an advisor, which is nontrivial, since in one-third of transactions our sample target companies did not hire one. We also analyse the choice to hire as advisor a bank with a strong prior relationship with the company (i.e., the main bank). Using data on 473 European M&A transactions completed in the period 1994-2003, we find evidence that the decision to hire an advisor depends on three main factors: (i) the intensity of the previous banking relationship, (ii) the reputation of the bidder company's advisor, and (iii) the complexity of the deal. We also investigate the impact of the bank advisor on shareholder wealth. We find that the abnormal returns of target company shareholders increase with the intensity of the previous banking relationship, thus indicating a 'certification role' on the part of investment banks.</p>"

<p>According to recent studies in international management, relationships between headquarters and subsidiaries in the global economy are characterised simultaneously by elements of organisational interdependence and local autonomy. These characteristics challenge the traditional design and use of performance measurement systems (PMSs). Contemporary approaches to PMSs emphasise the role of performance indicators for strategy implementation and advocate the adoption of non-financial indicators in addition to traditional financial metrics. We investigated the factors associated with the inclusion of non-financial indicators in PMSs used in relationships between headquarters and subsidiaries. Our empirical study is based on 141 questionnaires collected from Italian subsidiaries of foreign companies and 13 interviews with respondents. Non-financial performance indicators contained in PMSs refer equally to customer, internal processes and people measurement perspectives. Furthermore, we find that the inclusion of non-financial indicators is positively associated with relative performance evaluation, interactive use of PMSs, subsidiary size, headquarters nationality and subsidiary participation in the design of PMSs. Information gathered through interviews provides explanations of our results, and suggests that the inclusion of non-financial perspectives in PMSs contributes to the strategic alignment of international organisations by supporting learning and dialogue within relationships between headquarters and subsidiaries.

We describe research centers with a formal arrangement for accommodating external membership as being consortial research centers (CRC).

We derive hypotheses from resource dependence theory, market forces theory, and strategic behavior model explanations for such firm behavior. Panel data from 503 firms, in 104 industries from 1978 through 1996 were used to test the hypotheses. The decision to join a CRC was modeled using multivariate binomial probit analysis. Results showed that industry competitiveness, technological opportunities and the production of complementary innovations are all positively related to propensity to join a CRC.

<p>In a stochastic two-period OLG model, featuring an aggregate shock to the economy, ex-ante optimality requires intergenerational risk sharing. We compare the level of intergenerational risk sharing chosen by a benevolent government and by an office-seeking politician. In our political system, the transfer of resources across generations is determined as a Markov equilibrium of a probabilistic voting game. Low realized returns on the risky asset induce politicians to compensate the old through a PAYG system. This political system typically generates an intergenerational risk sharing scheme that is (i) larger, (ii) more persistent, and (iii) less responsive to the realization of the shock than the social optimum. This is because the current politician anticipates her transfers to the elderly to be compensated by future politicians through offsetting transfers, and hence overspends. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

<p>In most modern democracies elected officials can work in the private sector while appointed in parliament. We show that when the political and market sectors are not mutually exclusive, a trade-off arises between the quality of elected officials and the time they devote to political life. If high-ability citizens can keep earning money outside of parliament, they will be more likely to run for election; for the same reason, they will also be more likely to shirk once elected. These predictions are confronted with a dataset about members of the Italian Parliament from 1996 to 2006. The empirical evidence shows that bad but dedicated politicians come along with good but not fully committed politicians. There is in fact a non-negligible fraction of citizens with remarkably high pre-election income who are appointed in parliament. These citizens are those who gain relatively more from being elected in terms of outside income. At the same time, they are less committed to the parliamentary activity in terms of voting attendance.

<p>The approval (2003) and enforcement (2005) of a smoking ban in Italy have been viewed by many as an unexpectedly successful example of policy change. The present paper, by applying a processualist approach, concentrates on two policy cycles between 2000 and 2005. These had opposing outcomes: an incomplete decisional stage and an authoritative decision, enforced two years later. Through the analysis of the different phases of agenda setting, alternative specification and decision making, we have compared the quality of participation of policy entrepreneurs in the two cycles, their political strategies and, in these, the relevance of issue image. The case allows us to direct the attention of scholars and practitioners to an early phase of the policy implementation process - which we have named 'transition to practice'. This, managed with political strategy, might have strongly contributed to the final successful policy outcome.</p>"

Using the context of street art, we document four main ideologies of public space consumption that result from the interaction, both conflict and common intent, of urban dwellers and street artists. We show how public space can be contested as private and commercialized, or offered back as a collective good, where sense of belonging and dialogue restore it to a meaningful place. We demonstrate how the common nature of space both stimulates dialectical and dialogical exchanges across stakeholders and fuels forms of layered agency.</p>"

In this paper we show how designers and NPD managers have different perceptions of ""good"" design and the ways to achieve it.

<p>Anticipating the future is both a social obligation and intellectual challenge that no scientific discipline can escape.(1) The field of international studies is no exception to this, and we believe that few other disciplines reflect so deeply about their own capacity to provide accurate forecasts and to deliver useful early warning schemes. One school of thought declares prediction to be an impossible aspiration, sometimes because certain events are a priori considered to be unforeseeable (cf. Beyerchen 1992). The ex post facto realization that dramatic singular events like the fall of the Berlin Wall (e.g., Gaddis 1992) or the September 11 terrorist attacks (e.g., Herrmann and Choi 2007) shape global politics dramatically nurture this radical skepticism. Government, IGO, and NGO officials often take the opposite view that academics could anticipate the future if they would accept their ""responsibility"" of contributing something useful to society. Users of such forecasts in offices around the world are, for obvious reasons, convinced that anticipating the future is possible.

Comparing practices in articles addressing rigor extensively and less extensively, the authors reveal three strategies for insuring rigor. First, very few case study authors explicitly label the rigor criteria in terms of the concepts commonly used in the positivist tradition (construct, internal, and external validity, as well as reliability). Despite this, papers addressing rigor extensively do report concrete research actions taken to ensure methodological rigor. Second, papers addressing rigor extensively prioritized rigor types: more, and more detailed, strategies were reported for ensuring internal and construct validity than for external validity. Third, emergent strategies used in the field were reported, such as setbacks and serendipities, that necessitated changes to the originally planned research procedures. Authors focus squarely on the concrete research actions taken, carefully relaying them to the reader so that the reader may appreciate the logic and purpose of trade-off decisions in the context of the specific case study.</p>"

<p>This paper presents a quantitative study carried out on more than 200 manufacturing plants located in Italy. The study aimed to explore whether small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in Italy are more responsive than large enterprises and determine what the levers are that these enterprises would employ to achieve their responsiveness. Logistic responsiveness has been considered a key driver of competitiveness. Several studies have suggested that company size is a major determinant of responsiveness and that SMEs have both strengths and weaknesses that influence their ability to promptly react to customer needs. The evidence of this study indicates that SMEs are more responsive than large companies in terms of delivery. This performance advantage is mainly the result of a rather narrow product range and a simpler product structure that allows SMEs to enjoy shorter manufacturing and assembly lead times. On the other hand, this study also shows that SMEs perform worse than large enterprises with respect to longer set-up times.</p>"

<p>This article examines the entry into and survival in the U.S. software market by a sample of firms based in India, Ireland, and Israel, with a focus on the pre-entry technological capabilities, international linkages, and home-based experience of these films as determinants. Using a novel measure of foreign activity, namely, the registration of software trademarks in the United States, this study applies the date of the first trademark application filed with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office as a proxy for a firm's U.S. entry. Trademark renewals and new trademark applications trace the sample firms' survival. The analysis shows that international linkages have a positive relationship with entry and survival, whereas firm technological capabilities and age are not associated with entry, though technological capabilities affect the likelihood of survival.

<p>An increasing number of countries show a trend towards a certain degree of consolidation of powers in financial supervision, which has resulted in the establishment of unified regulators, that are different from the national central banks. By contrast a high involvement of the central bank in supervision seems to be correlated with a multi-authorities regime (central bank fragmentation effect). This paper, using a simple application of a general common agency game, sheds light on which conditions the politicians prefer when implementing an unified sector supervision outside the central bank. From a theoretical point of view the quality of public sector governance plays a crucial role in determining the supervision unification. Focusing on the behaviour of the ""good"" policymaker (helping hand type), it will prefer a unified financial authority that is different from the central bank if the correspondent welfare gains-linked to at least one of the three effects: moral hazard, conflict of interest, bureaucracy-are considered higher respect to the information losses. The ""bad"" policymaker (grabbing hand type) will choose the single financial authority if the financial industry likes it, and the central bank is not a captured one. On the other hand, the paper tests the model, confirming the robustness of the institutional position of the central bank in explaining the recent trend in supervision consolidation, with an empirical analysis performed with ordered functions on an updated dataset.

<p>The role of infrastructure as a factor of growth and development of countries and regions is often considered to be crucial. Among the various types of transport infrastructure, airports are considered as particularly strategic because of the increasing importance of air transport in connecting territories. This paper studies the impact of airports on Italian provinces. To this end, it builds on the framework proposed by Brueckner, where sectoral employment is regressed on a series of controls and on airline traffic. That framework is extended to take account of selection bias due to the location choices of airports and spatial spillover effects. It is found that the elasticity of service-sector employment to airport passengers is 0.045 and that of spillover effects due to neighbouring airports is almost 0.017.</p>"

<p>The empirical literature on happiness finds that employment significantly contributes to well-being. We propose a dynamic model that explains why individuals may nonetheless be reluctant to pick up low-paid work. Accepting low-paid work will put them in an adverse position in future wage bargaining, as employers could infer the individual's low reservation wage from his working history. Employers will exploit their knowledge by offering low wages to this individual in the future. Therefore, employees with low reservation wage strategically opt into unemployment to signal a high reservation wage. (JEL: D 82, J 30, J 64)</p>"

<p>In a duopoly with price discrimination and switching costs, we analyse the evolution of market structure, when an incumbent and a new entrant compete, and a new class of users with lower willingness to pay appears in the market. We find that the market share of the new entrant depends on the degree of heterogeneity and the level of switching costs. In particular, if the degree of heterogeneity is intermediate, the evolution of market structure is similar for high and null switching costs. Since consumer surplus and social welfare are unambiguously lower under high switching costs, this result points at the risk of inferring the degree of market competitiveness from the convergence in market shares.</p>"

<p>Background: Equity in delivery and distribution of health care is an important determinant of health and a cornerstone in the long way to social justice. We performed a comparative analysis of the prevalence of Italian and British residents who have fully paid out-of-pocket for health services which they could have obtained free of charge or at a lower cost from their respective National Health Services. Methods: Cross-sectional study based on a standardized questionnaire survey carried out in autumn 2006 among two representative samples (n = 1000) of the general population aged 20-74 years in each of the two countries. Results: 78% (OR 19.9; 95% CI 15.5-25.6) of Italian residents have fully paid out-of-pocket for at least one access to health services in their lives, and 45% (OR 18.1; 95% CI 12.9-25.5) for more than five accesses. Considering only the last 2 years, 61% (OR 16.5; 95% CI 12.6-21.5) of Italians have fully paid out-of-pocket for at least one access. The corresponding pattern for British residents is 20 and 4% for lifelong prevalence, and 10% for the last 2 years. Conclusions: Opening the public health facilities to a privileged private access to all hospital physicians based on patient's ability to pay, as Italy does, could be a source of social inequality in access to care and could probably represent a major obstacle to decreasing waiting times for patients in the standard formal 'free of charge' way of access.</p>"

The first aim is substantive: analysing and evaluating recent labour market reforms in Italy with particular reference to the possible emergence of a new flexicurity model. The second goal is to contribute to the debate on labour market development and flexicurity by enriching and refining the available analytical tools. More specifically, we argue that the traditional conceptual 'lenses' focusing on the 'insiders'/'outsiders' divide are inadequate to grasp the ongoing changes in the Italian labour market. This leads us to identify a third category of workers, the 'mid-siders', who are increasingly relevant in the Italian case and may prove to be relevant in other labour markets too. Moreover, we introduce the concept of 'selective flexicurity', referring to the fact that in the Italian case flexibility and security measures have been applied differently across the various categories of workers.</p>"

<p>Scholarly research largely converges on the argument that trust is of paramount importance to drive economic agents toward mutually satisfactory, fair, and ethically compliant behaviors. There is, however, little agreement on the meaning of trust, whose conceptualizations differ with respect to actors, relationships, behaviors, and contexts. At present, we know much better what trust does than what trust is. In this article, we present an extensive review and analysis of the most prominent articles on trust in market relationships. Using computer-aided content analysis and network analysis methods, we identify key, recurring dimensions that guided the conceptualization of trust in past research, and show how trust can be developed as a multifaceted and layered construct. Our results are an important contribution to a convergence of research toward a shared and common view of the meaning of trust. This process is important to ensure the body of trust research's internal theoretical consistency, and to provide reliable and common principles for the management of business relationships - a context in which opportunism and imperfect information may induce economic actors to cheat and stray from fair and ethically compliant behaviors.</p>"

<p>OBJECTIVES Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of an outcome bias in medical decision making, which can be represented by a tendency to overweight outcome information when evaluating the quality of a decision. This study investigates whether the outcome of a previous decision on a medical case affects a later decision on a similar case.</p>
<p>METHODS Thirty-six practising doctors and 36 nurses were presented with two superficially different but structurally identical dichotomous diagnostic problems, at intervals of about 6 weeks. The first problem was followed by the delivery of information about the outcome that could be either positive or negative.</p>
<p>RESULTS Of the doctors, 39% of those who received information indicating an adverse outcome in the first case modified their diagnosis in the second case, whereas none of the doctors who were given information indicating a positive outcome made an alternative diagnosis. Of the nurses, 22% of those given information of a positive outcome and 56% of those given information of a negative outcome in the first case made an alternative decision in the second case.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS The results show that the outcome of a previous single case can be over-weighted in the process of making a later decision about a similar case, to the point that information on outcome alone can modify a decision that the health provider originally thought to be optimal, according to his or her experience and the available evidence. Hence, outcome bias not only affects the evaluation of a decision, but can also affect learning by modifying later decisions.</p>"

<p>The discovery of biomarkers that predict treatment effectiveness has great potential for improving medical care, particularly in oncology. These biomarkers are increasingly reported on a continuous scale, allowing investigators to explore how treatment efficacy varies as the biomarker values continuously increase, as opposed to using arbitrary categories of expression levels resulting in a loss of information. In the age of biomarkers as continuous predictors (eg, expression level percentage rather than positive v negative), alternatives to such dichotomized analyses are needed. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of an intuitive statistical approach-the subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot (STEPP)-for evaluating treatment-effect heterogeneity when a biomarker is measured on a continuous scale. STEPP graphically explores the patterns of treatment effect across overlapping intervals of the biomarker values. As an example, STEPP methodology is used to explore patterns of treatment effect for varying levels of the biomarker Ki-67 in the BIG (Breast International Group) 1-98 randomized clinical trial comparing letrozole with tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. STEPP analyses showed patients with higher Ki-67 values who were assigned to receive tamoxifen had the poorest prognosis and may benefit most from letrozole. J Clin Oncol 28:4539-4544.

<p>This study analyzes which factors prompt customers to attribute value to products they design themselves using mass-customization (MC) toolkits. The assumption that self-design delivers superior customer value is fundamental to the concept of MC toolkits and can be found in almost any conceptual work in this field. However, spectacular failures reinforce the practical relevance of developing a deeper understanding of why and when MC toolkits generate value for customers-and when they do not. Research to date has assumed that the closer fit between the self-designed product's characteristics and the preferences of the customer is the dominant source of value. In this research, it is asked whether the enjoyment and perceived effort of the self-design process have an additional impact on the perceived value of self-designed products. This question is interesting because one could argue that a rational actor would hardly be willing to pay ex post for an economic good already consumed. The hypotheses are tested on 186 participants designing their own scarves with an MC toolkit. After completing the process, they submitted binding bids for ""their"" products in Vickrey auctions. Therefore, real buying behavior, not merely stated intentions, is observed. The present study finds that the subjective value of a self-designed product (i.e., one's bid in the course of the auction) is indeed impacted not only by the preference fit the customer expects it to deliver but also by (1) the process enjoyment the customer reports, (2) the interaction of preference fit and process enjoyment, and (3) the interaction of preference fit and perceived process effort. In addition to its main effect, preference fit can be interpreted as a moderator of the value-generating effect of process evaluation: in cases where the outcome of the process is perceived as positive (high preference fit), the customer also interprets process effort as a positive accomplishment, and this positive effect adds (further) value to the product. It appears that the perception of the self-design process as a good or bad experience is partly constructed on the basis of the outcome of the process. In the opposite case (low preference fit), effort creates a negative effect that further reduces the subjective value of the product. Likewise, process enjoyment is amplified by preference fit, although enjoyment also has a significant main effect, which means that regardless of the outcome, customers attribute higher value to a self-designed product if they enjoy the process. In a way, this effect resembles of the classic story of Tom Sawyer and the fence, in which Tom manages to ""frame"" the tedious chore of whitewashing a fence as a rare opportunity-thus persuading his friends to pay him for letting them work. Manufacturers designing an MC system therefore are advised to designing MC toolkits in a way that they elicit positive affective reactions that make their customers value their work.</p>"

The journals in which the authors prefer to publish and their reasons for journal choice are also reported. This is the first reported study to specifically address reasons for publication choice in a professional field, and it indicates that relevance to practice is an important consideration, in addition to scholarly rigor, when authors in professional fields consider where to publish their research. The views and motivations of full professors, other researchers and practitioner-authors were surprisingly similar, although practitioners who had less research preparation than researchers were less confident about their ability to conduct and write-up research. Additionally, researchers other than full professors, and practitioners, reported that the encouragements of peers and supervisors or senior colleagues were important social influences for research and publication.

<p>P>One important effect of the increasing integration of the world economy is the rising importance of possibilities to offshore and outsource value-creating activities. In many industries, firms are able to disaggregate their value chains into smaller parts. This process allows for a less path-dependent approach to the firm's ideal location profile (through offshoring and relocation) and control strategies (through outsourcing). This article argues that optimal decisions regarding individual processes recognize the linkages of these processes with the firm's entire value chain. The article explores the magnitude, sequence, and dynamics of interdependent decisions regarding the location and control of various parts of the value chain. By using case illustrations from the mobile handset and financial services industries, this article provides a novel perspective on the disintegration, mobility, and reintegration of value chain activities in a global context.</p>"

<p>A conspicuous 'hole' lies between the 'rational-choice' paradigm and the 'behavioral decision-making' paradigm. The 'missing model' is 'heuristic' (research-based) yet 'rational' (non-biasing): a set of methods for the logically sound discovery and design of economic actions, options and objectives. Such a model is developed in this paper, enriching the notion and repertory of heuristics that are typically considered in economic and cognitive sciences with the notion and set of heuristics typically considered in the philosophy of science and the logic of discovery. The model then provides a response to the hitherto unaddressed question of how knowledge, on which the rationality and wisdom of any decision largely depends, can be constructed in a valid and reliable way. The specification of the heuristics that can effectively and efficiently guide economic discovery and innovation seems to be overdue in an economy said to be knowledge intensive and innovation oriented.</p>"

<p>Although the characteristics and advantages of interorganizational governance models based on extensive collaboration are well established in the literature, inquiry has only recently extended to sustainable supply chain management, highlighting the potential benefits of combining the integration of social and environmental issues concerning the supply chain with governance models based on joint decision making and extensive cooperation. Yet, firms still differ in both the pervasiveness of such collaborative approaches along the value chain and the extent to which sustainability issues are addressed to the advantage of all parties involved. In an attempt to predict variety in the governance models related to sustainability along the value chain, we propose a theoretical model that identifies and frames four sustainable supply chain governance (SSCG) models, resulting from combinations of supply chain network density and centrality of the focal organizations. We show how, as centrality increases, firms are able to exert influence over their network, coordinating integrated approaches along the value chain. Moreover, as high centrality combines with increasing interconnectedness of the actors within a supply chain network, instrumental approaches are progressively replaced by more relational attitudes aimed at joint value creation among partners. Conditions for SSCG models' success and the main benefits gained by firms in different structural contexts are also discussed.</p>"

<p>In this paper, we analyze the current trend towards a higher degree of market integration in Europe and identify those aspects that are particularly relevant for Italy. The Italian involvement in this process appears comparatively modest. A welfare analysis, which focuses specifically on the integration of the Italian market, will certainly be a useful support to any policy decision. We argue that, given the peculiarities of the Italian market design, a volume coupling solution could avoid, at the moment, the costs of what could be a significant harmonization effort and, in the end, it might constitute the best short-term strategy. This proposal should be adequately considered, taking into account the complexity of designing an efficient volume-only coordination procedure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,</p>"

<p>This paper analyses the effects of implementing a family-based and an individual in-work benefit in the southern European countries using EUROMOD, the EU-wide tax-benefit microsimulation model. In-work benefits are means-tested cash transfers given to individuals, through the tax system, conditional on their employment status. They are intended to enhance the incentives to accept work and redistribute resources to low income groups. The family-based in-work benefits seem to be more redistributive, in particular in Italy and Portugal, but the presence of extended families does not enable such policies to be well targeted on the very poorest, especially in Spain. Individual policies lead to better incentives to work than family-based in-work benefits, in particular for Spanish and Italian women in couples whose labour market participation is far below the European average.</p>"

<p>Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to draw on self-categorisation theory and nation branding to investigate the social identities and influences which underpin consumer preferences for national brands.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - A survey in Mozambique, an underdeveloped African country, compared a domestic mobile phone company whose brand contains the country name against a European brand. Consumer ethnocentrism might arise identifying with the national brand or with Mozambican personalities endorsing the brand. Value-expressiveness might arise from consumers associating with celebrity endorsers. A dichotomy of youth versus older consumers moderated the relationships between social identities and brand preference. Bayesian structural equation modelling using Monte Carlo simulations estimated the path coefficients from a sample of 611.</p>
<p>Findings - Across age groups, ethnocentrism is stronger than value-expressiveness in determining preference for national brands. Moreover, ethnocentrism is stronger with the older rather than younger consumers. Consumer ethnocentrism stemmed mainly from injunctive influence (IN) with both age groups. With older consumers, value-expressiveness related significantly to descriptive influence, but not to IN. With youth, neither social influence significantly, related to value-expressiveness.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - Single-item measures might be less effective than multi-item measures for psychological concepts of social identities and influences.</p>
<p>Practical implications - Understanding the role of social identity in consumer preferences for national brands may help managers heighten consumers' social identities and increase their loyalty for national brands. Shedding light on under-researched African consumers may help firms doing business in these emerging markets as well as African governments that are attempting to strengthen the perceptions of their nation brand.</p>
<p>Originality/value - This paper bridges research in social psychology and international marketing by investigating the social identities and influences that underpin consumer preferences for national brands.</p>"

<p>The channels through which firms access and acquire new and relevant knowledge for their innovative activities is a critical issue to the geography and the management of innovation. In this regard, recent studies have suggested that the mobility of workers across firms is a primary source of new knowledge for the hiring firm and, more in general, of knowledge diffusion across firms. However, little evidence has been presented and discussed about the role and the impact of workers' mobility on the processes of knowledge transfer across firms. The present paper, thus, aims precisely at contributing to this stream of research by making use of unique data on Italian inventors' curriculum vitae. The results of the empirical analysis indicate that the mobility of inventors is a mechanism that spurs processes of cumulative knowledge and innovation building from the departure firm to the destination one and significantly impacts on knowledge diffusion across firms.</p>"

<p>In this study the authors propose a distinction between two approaches to market information, rooted in the marked-based learning theory. The two approaches are conceptualized and operationalized on the basis of their differences along three processes: generation, dissemination and use of market information. In the retrospective approach, the generation process is based on expressed customer needs and extant market relations; the dissemination is based on formal mechanisms; the use process is more instrumental. In the forward-looking approach, the generation process is based on latent customer needs and on the evolutionary patterns of the future market relations; the dissemination process is more informal; the use of information is more conceptual. A series of hypotheses concerning the relationships between these approaches, product innovativeness and firm performance are tested on a sample of Italian fashion firms. Results suggest that the two approaches are complementary for firm performance, but have opposite effects on product innovativeness: while a forward-looking approach is positively related to product innovativeness, a retrospective approach seems to be negatively related. The results also shed light on how market information approaches and product innovativeness jointly affect firm performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Background: Scientific research has provided evidence on benefits of well developed primary care systems. The relevance of some of this research for the European situation is limited. There is currently a lack of up to date comprehensive and comparable information on variation in development of primary care, and a lack of knowledge of structures and strategies conducive to strengthening primary care in Europe. The EC funded project Primary Health Care Activity Monitor for Europe (PHAMEU) aims to fill this gap by developing a Primary Care Monitoring System (PC Monitor) for application in 31 European countries. This article describes the development of the indicators of the PC Monitor, which will make it possible to create an alternative model for holistic analyses of primary care.</p>
<p>Methods: A systematic review of the primary care literature published between 2003 and July 2008 was carried out. This resulted in an overview of: (1) the dimensions of primary care and their relevance to outcomes at (primary) health system level; (2) essential features per dimension; (3) applied indicators to measure the features of primary care dimensions. The indicators were evaluated by the project team against criteria of relevance, precision, flexibility, and discriminating power. The resulting indicator set was evaluated on its suitability for Europe-wide comparison of primary care systems by a panel of primary care experts from various European countries (representing a variety of primary care systems).</p>
<p>Results: The developed PC Monitor approaches primary care in Europe as a multidimensional concept. It describes the key dimensions of primary care systems at three levels: structure, process, and outcome level. On structure level, it includes indicators for governance, economic conditions, and workforce development. On process level, indicators describe access, comprehensiveness, continuity, and coordination of primary care services. On outcome level, indicators reflect the quality, and efficiency of primary care.</p>
<p>Conclusions: A standardized instrument for describing and comparing primary care systems has been developed based on scientific evidence and consensus among an international panel of experts, which will be tested to all configurations of primary care in Europe, intended for producing comparable information. Widespread use of the instrument has the potential to improve the understanding of primary care delivery in different national contexts and thus to create opportunities for better decision making.</p>"

<p>In high-reliability organizations (HROs) even minor errors can seriously hinder the very existence of the firm and the safety of employees and customers. Field studies have shown that HROs encourage the reporting of errors and near misses, exploiting these incidents to improve their operative processes. In this paper, we describe this practice as a 'no blame' approach to error management, and link it to learning theory, showing how no blame practices can enhance organizational learning. By taking a cognitive perspective of organizations, we draw on existing contributions and on a set of empirical case studies to discuss the characteristics of no blame practices, and their applicability in traditional, non-HROs. Our findings show that, in exploiting information from error-reporting, no blame practices are beneficial in environments where learning and reliability issues are particularly relevant. Empirical evidence suggests that a no blame approach can be extremely constructive for organizations that want to enhance their learning processes. We conclude that a no blame approach is a valuable way to achieve an organization that has flexibility and variability. However, no blame practices imply a set of organizational issues and costs that pose significant challenges to firms operating in non-high-reliability settings. The findings from our study contribute to the literature on HROs and organizational learning.</p>"

<p>This study develops and tests a theory of experience spillovers across corporate development activities. In particular, we investigate the impact of prior alliance experience on the performance implications of corporate acquisitions. We start with the simple suggestion that such experience spillovers will depend on the similarity among the managerial processes characterizing these activities. The empirical evidence confirms that the more the focal acquisition is managed in ways that are typical of partnerships (e. g., with low integration or with high relational quality levels), the more positive is the effect of past alliance experience on acquisition performance. However, we also find that alliance experience can be detrimental under certain circumstances, such as when the acquisition is managed with more aggressive post-acquisition integration approaches. This paper proposes a more sophisticated model of experience spillovers that can accommodate both positive and negative experience spillover effects across complex organizational tasks.</p>"

<p>Previous research considering a normative perspective for fostering knowledge integration at the team level of analysis underscores that teams are often reluctant to share important knowledge among their members. In the attempt to provide a wider perspective on team knowledge integration, we take a different perspective, basing our arguments on team climate theoretical framework. Specifically, we argue that an autonomy and experimental climate (i.e. shared perception that the team supports autonomous action and experimentation and risk taking) can favor the team's ability to integrate members' knowledge. Indeed, focusing on members' willingness to contribute to team well-being, team autonomy and experimental climate may enhance the team's capability to integrate knowledge enabled by the IT infrastructure (IT knowledge integration capability). We tested our research model on a sample of 410 members and leaders of 69 organizational work teams. Results show the critical role played by team climate in favoring IT knowledge integration capability, which in turn affects team outcomes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This article studies the effects of conflict onset on asset markets applying the event study methodology. The authors consider a sample of 101 internal and inter-state conflicts during the period 1974-2004 and find that a sizeable fraction of them has had a significant impact on stock market indices, exchange rates, oil and commodity prices. This fraction is inconsistent with pure chance, that is, with the selected probability of type-I errors in our tests of statistical significance. The results suggest that, on average, national stock markets are more likely to display positive than negative reactions to conflict onset. When the authors distinguish between internal and inter-state conflicts, they find that the fraction of significant results is higher for international conflicts. When the authors classify events according to the region where they occur, they find that Asia and the Middle East are the regions where conflicts tend to have the strongest effects. Finally, the article reports evidence that abnormal returns would have accrued to investors systematically exploiting conflict onset to implement conflict-driven strategies. Results are robust to selecting a subset of high-intensity conflicts and to expanding the time window over which conflict events are defined. The findings of the article confirm the economic importance of the effects of conflicts on asset markets.</p>"

<p>The traditional new product development (NPD) model, in which companies are exclusively responsible for coming up with new product ideas and for deciding which products should ultimately be marketed, is increasingly being challenged by innovation management academics and practitioners alike. In particular, many have advocated the idea of democratizing innovation by empowering customers to take a much more active stake in corporate NPD. This has become feasible because the Internet now allows companies to build strong online communities through which they can listen to and integrate thousands of customers from all over the world. Extant research has provided strong arguments that indicate that customer empowerment in NPD enables firms to develop better products and at the same time to reduce costs and risks if customers in a given domain are willing and able to deliver valuable input. Customer empowerment, however, not only affects the firm's internal NPD processes as reflected in the products that are ultimately marketed. Instead, it might also affect the way companies are perceived in the marketplace (by customers who observe that companies foster customer empowerment in NPD). This paper provides the first empirical study to explore how customers from the ""periphery"" (i.e., the mass that does not participate) perceive customer empowerment strategies. Customer empowerment in NPD is conceptualized along two basic dimensions: (1) customer empowerment to create (ideas for) new product designs; and (2) customer empowerment to select the product designs to be produced. Therefore, customers may be empowered to submit (ideas for) new products (empowerment to create) or (2) to ""vote"" on which products should ultimately be marketed (empowerment to select). In the course of two experimental studies using three different product categories (T-shirts, furniture, and bicycles) both customer empowerment dimensions (as well as its interaction) are found to lead to (1) increased levels of perceived customer orientation, (2) more favorable corporate attitudes, (3) and stronger behavioral intentions. These findings will be very useful to researchers and managers interested in understanding the enduring consequences of customer empowerment in NPD. Most importantly, the results suggest that empowerment strategies might be used to improve a firm's corporate associations as perceived by the broad mass of (potential) customers. In particular, marketers might foster customer empowerment as an effective means of enhancing perceived customer orientation. Customers will in turn provide rewards, as they will form more favorable corporate attitudes and will be more likely to choose the products of empowering as opposed to nonempowering companies, ceteris paribus. Customer empowerment thus constitutes a promising positioning strategy that managers can pursue to create a competitive advantage in the marketplace.</p>"

<p>Knowledge of social contact patterns still represents the most critical step for understanding the spread of directly transmitted infections. Data on social contact patterns are, however, expensive to obtain. A major issue is then whether the simulation of synthetic societies might be helpful to reliably reconstruct such data. In this paper, we compute a variety of synthetic age-specific contact matrices through simulation of a simple individual-based model (IBM). The model is informed by Italian Time Use data and routine socio-demographic data (e. g., school and workplace attendance, household structure, etc.). The model is named ""Little Italy'' because each artificial agent is a clone of a real person. In other words, each agent's daily diary is the one observed in a corresponding real individual sampled in the Italian Time Use Survey. We also generated contact matrices from the socio-demographic model underlying the Italian IBM for pandemic prediction. These synthetic matrices are then validated against recently collected Italian serological data for Varicella (VZV) and ParvoVirus (B19). Their performance in fitting sero-profiles are compared with other matrices available for Italy, such as the Polymod matrix. Synthetic matrices show the same qualitative features of the ones estimated from sample surveys: for example, strong assortativeness and the presence of super-and sub-diagonal stripes related to contacts between parents and children. Once validated against serological data, Little Italy matrices fit worse than the Polymod one for VZV, but better than concurrent matrices for B19. This is the first occasion where synthetic contact matrices are systematically compared with real ones, and validated against epidemiological data. The results suggest that simple, carefully designed, synthetic matrices can provide a fruitful complementary approach to questionnaire-based matrices. The paper also supports the idea that, depending on the transmissibility level of the infection, either the number of different contacts, or repeated exposure, may be the key factor for transmission.</p>"

<p>The authors suggest a new comprehensive measure of support given through tax benefit systems to families with children. Using microsimulation techniques, this accounts for all provisions contingent on the presence of children, while usually only gross child/family benefits are considered. The authors use EUROMOD, the European Union tax-benefit microsimulation model, to quantify the support for children and analyze its impact on household incomes and child poverty for 19 countries. The authors find that the conventional approach underestimates on average the total amount of support for children by about one fifth. Furthermore, the differences between two measures vary considerably across countries and are, therefore, critical for cross-national comparisons.</p>"

Using absolute performance-adjusted discretionary accruals, special items, and deferred tax expense as alternative constructs for earnings management, we find that earnings management does not vary with board composition and structure, or with audit committee composition, expertise, and ownership. In contrast, board size and audit committee size, activity, and tenure are associated with earnings management. More important, the strength of this association is considerably weaker for the post-SOX years compared to the pre-SOX years. Finally, we find no evidence to suggest that the overall level of earnings management declined following SOX.</p>"

<p>Analysts' target prices have received limited attention in academic research. In this paper we try to fill the gap by developing an innovative multi-layer accuracy metric that we test on a novel database. Our analysis shows that forecasting accuracy is very limited: prediction errors are consistent, auto-correlated, non-mean reverting and large (up to 36.6%). The size of forecasting errors increases with the predicted growth in the stock price, the size of the company and for loss making firms. Additionally, the intensity of research and the market momentum negatively affect accuracy. These results suggest that analysts' research is systematically biased which supports theoretical predictions by <link rid=""b26"">Ottaviani and Sorensen (2006). Since stock price forecasting is largely an unmonitored activity, market participants may fail in fully understanding this behavior, thus not arbitraging away these inefficiencies.</p>"

<p>We analyze the general (multiallelic) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium problem from an objective Bayesian testing standpoint. We argue that for small or moderate sample sizes the answer is rather sensitive to the prior chosen, and this suggests to carry out a sensitivity analysis with respect to the prior. This goal is achieved through the identification of a class of priors specifically designed for this testing problem. In this paper, we consider the class of intrinsic priors under the full model, indexed by a tuning quantity, the training sample size. These priors are objective, satisfy Savage's continuity condition and have proved to behave extremely well for many statistical testing problems. We compute the posterior probability of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium model for the class of intrinsic priors, assess robustness over the range of plausible answers, as well as stability of the decision in favor of either hypothesis.

<p>This paper studies the nature, sources and determinants of international patenting activity in Latin American countries (LACs) and examines the extent to which LACs benefit from R&D that is performed in the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). By using patents and patent citations from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, we trace sectoral knowledge flows from G-5 countries to LACs. We study the impact of three channels of knowledge flows: foreign R&D, patent citation-related spillovers, and face-to-face contact spillovers. Our results, based on data for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, suggest that international knowledge spillovers from the G-5 countries were a significant determinant of inventive activity during the period 1988-2003. We find that the stock of ideas produced in the USA has a strong impact on the international patenting activity of these countries. Moreover, controlling for US-driven R&D effects, bilateral patent citations and face-to-face relationships between inventors are both important additional mechanisms of knowledge transmission. Some of our results suggest that the latter mechanism is more important than the former.</p>"

<p>This article focuses on a relatively unappreciated consequence of localized knowledge spillovers: their implications for productivity across skills. Spillovers benefit skilled workers more than unskilled ones, weaken complementarity between them, and widen their productivity gap. To test this theory, the authors use data from 146 U.S. cities and find that cities with a greater intensity of localized knowledge spillovers exhibit a bigger productivity gap across skills, after controlling for the endogeneity of knowledge spillovers, interindustry differences, and other factors. These results imply that in the long run, economies characterized by localized knowledge spillovers encourage investments in education and attract skilled people, raising the relative share of the skilled population. When complementarity across skills weakens, this analysis also offers a framework to link localized knowledge spillovers to the formation of entrepreneurial skill-intensive firms.

<p>Unskilled workers in low productivity jobs typically experience higher labour turnover. This article shows how this finding is related to variation in the efficiency of the matching process across occupations. If employers find it less profitable to invest in search and screening activities when recruiting for low-productivity jobs, matches at the lower end of the occupation distribution will be more prone to separation. The analysis of a unique sample of British hirings, containing detailed information about employers' recruitment practices, shows that more intensive recruitment leads to matches of better quality that pay higher wages, last longer and make employers more satisfied with the person taken on.</p>"

<p>This work aims to provide a systematic and updated survey of original scientific studies on the effect of the introduction of reference pricing (RP) policies in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. We searched PubMed, EconLit and Web of Knowledge for articles on RP. We reviewed studies that met the inclusion criteria established in the search strategy. From a total of 468 references, we selected the 35 that met all of the inclusion criteria.</p>
<p>Some common themes emerged in the literature. The first was that RP was generally associated with a decrease in the prices of the drugs subject to the policy. In particular, price drops seem to have been experienced in virtually every country that implemented a generic RP (GRP) policy. A GRP policy applies only to products with expired patents and generic competition, and clusters drugs according to chemical equivalence (same form and active compound). More significant price decreases were observed in the sub-markets in which drugs were already facing generic competition prior to RP. Price drops varied widely according to the amount of generic competition and industrial strategies: brand-named drugs originally priced above RP values decreased their prices to a greater extent. A second common theme was that both therapeutic RP (TRP) and GRP have been associated with significant and consistent savings in the first years of application. A third general result is that generic market shares significantly increased whenever the firms producing brand-named drugs did not adopt one of the following strategies: lowering prices to RP values; launching new dosages and/or formulations; or marketing substitute drugs still under patent protection. Finally, concerning TRP, although more evidence is needed, studies based on a large number of patient-level observations showed no association between the RP policy and health outcomes.</p>"

Endogeneity problems concerning promotion and productivity are addressed by specifying a generalized Tobit model, in which a selection probit equation accounts for the individual scientist's probability of promotion to her present rank, and a productivity regression estimates the effects of age, gender, cohort of entry, and collaboration characteristics, conditional on the scientist's rank. We find that the size and international nature of collaborative projects and co-authors' past productivity have very significant impacts on current productivity, while age, gender, and past productivity are also influential determinants of both productivity and probability of promotion. Furthermore we show that the stop and go policies of recruitment and promotion, typical of the Italian and French centralized academic systems of governance, can leave significant long-lasting cohort effects on research productivity.</p>"

<p>The use of multilevel models for the estimation of the propensity score for data with a hierarchical structure and unobserved cluster-level variables is proposed. This approach is compared with models that ignore the hierarchy, and models in which the hierarchy is represented by a fixed parameter for each cluster. It is shown, by simulation, that simple models with dummy variables outperform both random effect models and models ignoring the hierarchy in terms of balance of cluster-level unobserved covariates and omitted variable bias. The representation of the clusters by fixed or random effects defines a model more general than would be ideal if the relevant cluster-level variables were available. The general conclusion confirms that when conducting propensity score analysis it is safer to specify a more general model than pursuing model parsimony. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

<p>Utility function properties as monotonicity and concavity play a fundamental role in reflecting a decision-maker's preference structure. These properties are usually characterized via partial derivatives. However, elicitation methods do not necessarily lead to twice-differentiable utility functions. Furthermore, while in a single-attribute context concavity fully reflects risk aversion, in multiattribute problems such correspondence is not one-to-one. We show that Tsetlin and Winkler's multivariate risk attitudes imply ultramodularity of the utility function. We demonstrate that geometric properties of a multivariate utility function can be successfully studied by utilizing an integral function expansion (functional ANOVA). The necessary and sufficient conditions under which monotonicity and/or ultramodularity of single-attribute functions imply the monotonicity and/or ultramodularity of the corresponding multiattribute function under additive, preferential and mutual utility independence are then established without reliance on the utility function differentiability. We also investigate the relationship between the presence of interactions among the attributes of a multiattribute utility function and the decision-maker's multivariate risk attitudes.

<p>The recent tumor research has lead scientists to recognize the central role played by cancer stem cells in sustaining malignancy and chemo-resistance. A model of cancer presented by one of us describes the mechanisms that give rise to the different kinds of cancer stem-like cells and the role of these cells in cancer diseases. The model implies a shift in the conceptualization of the disease from reductionism to complexity theory. By exploiting the link between the agent-based simulation technique and the theory of complexity, the medical view is here translated into a corresponding computational model. Two main categories of agents characterize the model, 1) cancer stem-like cells and 2) stem cell differentiation stage factors. Cancer cells agents are then distinguished based on the differentiation stage associated with the malignancy. Differentiation factors interact with cancer cells and then, with varying degrees of fitness, induce differentiation or cause apoptosis. The model inputs are then fitted to experimental data and numerical simulations carried out. By performing virtual experiments on the model's choice variables a decision-maker (physician) can obtains insights on the progression of the disease and on the effects of a choice of administration frequency and or dose. The model also paves the way to future research, whose perspectives are discussed.</p>"

The second contribution of our work rests on the nature of the ESO expense.

We also find weak evidence of important differences across scientific fields with the more basic-oriented fields showing indications of a crowding-out effect. Second, our analysis of the potential impact of patenting on knowledge transfer shows a positive correlation between the stock of patents and engagement in knowledge transfer channels.

<p>The general concern on the environmental implications of the rising demand for coal registered in China during the last few years has induced considerable research effort to produce accurate forecasts of China's energy requirements. Nevertheless, no previous study has modelled the coal demand in China at provincial level. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we estimate and forecast the Chinese demand for coal using panel data disaggregated by provinces and accounting for spatial heterogeneity. Second, given the spatial nature of the data, we explicitly capture the spatial autocorrelation among provinces using spatial econometrics. In particular, we specify the Chinese industrial coal demand at provincial level with fixed-effect spatial models. The empirical results show that the fixed-effect spatial ADL model is able to capture the existing interdependence between provinces. This model forecasts an average annual increase in coal demand to 2010 of nearly 2%. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Markups vary widely across industries and countries, their heterogeneity has increased overtime and asymmetric exposure to international trade seems partly responsible for this phenomenon. In this paper, we study how the entire distribution of markups affects resource misallocation and welfare in a general equilibrium framework encompassing a large class of models with imperfect competition. We then identify conditions under which trade opening, by changing the distribution of markups, may reduce welfare. Our approach is novel both in its generality and in the emphasis on the second moment of the markup distribution. Two broad policy recommendations stand out from the analysis. First, whenever there is heterogeneity in markups, be it due to trade or other distortions, there is also an intersectoral misallocation, so that the equilibrium can be improved upon with an appropriate intervention. This suggests that trade liberalization and domestic industrial policy are complementary. Second, ensuring free entry is a crucial precondition to prevent adverse effects from asymmetric trade opening. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This paper uses a mixed method approach to show how cross-cultural differences in social influences can explain differences in distributions of market shares in different markets. First, we develop a realistic agent-based model that mimics the behavior of movie visitors and incorporates the social influences visitors exert on each other before and after visiting movies. The simulation results indicate that market inequalities are determined by social influences. In particular, we find that the social influence derived from the intended behaviors of others (coordinated consumption effect) has a stronger effect on market inequalities than the social influence derived from the past behavior of others (imitation effect). Second, we empirically validate the simulation results by conducting a cross-national survey that makes use of the cross-cultural differences in Hofstede's collectivism-individualism index as a proxy for the level of social influence present in a market. The results of this field study, performed in China, the Netherlands, Italy, and Spain, empirically show that social influences differ across countries, and that these differences can explain the apparent differences in the dispersion of movies' market shares.

<p>BACKGROUND: This study examines whether social age deadlines exist for childbearing in women and men, how they vary across countries, whether they are lower than actual biological deadlines and whether they are associated with childbearing at later ages and the availability of assisted reproduction techniques (ARTs).</p>
<p>METHODS: This study is based on the European Social Survey, Round 3 (2006-2007), which covers 25 countries. Data were gathered on social age deadlines for childbearing in women (21 909 cases) and men (21 239 cases) from samples of representative community-dwelling populations aged 15 and older.</p>
<p>RESULTS: Social age deadlines for childbearing were perceived more frequently for women than men. These deadlines are often lower than actual biological limits, and for women and men alike: 57.2% of respondents perceived a maternal social age deadline <= 40 years of age; 46.2% of the respondents perceived a paternal social age deadline <= 45 years of age. There is also considerable variability in deadlines across countries, as well as within them. At the country level, the presence of social age deadlines for the childbearing of women was negatively associated with birth rates at advanced ages and the prevalence of ART, and later deadlines were positively associated with these factors.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS: It is important to understand the factors that increase and limit late fertility. While biological factors condition fertility, so do social expectations. These findings provide widespread evidence across Europe that social limits exist alongside biological ones, though both sets of factors are more binding for women.</p>"

<p>This paper compares the mixed-data sampling (MIDAS) and mixed-frequency VAR (MF-VAR) approaches to model specification in the presence of mixed-frequency data, e.g. monthly and quarterly series. MIDAS leads to parsimonious models which are based on exponential lag polynomials for the coefficients, whereas MF-VAR does not restrict the dynamics and can therefore suffer from the curse of dimensionality. However, if the restrictions imposed by MIDAS are too stringent, the MF-VAR can perform better. Hence, it is difficult to rank MIDAS and MF-VAR a priori, and their relative rankings are better evaluated empirically. In this paper, we compare their performances in a case which is relevant for policy making, namely nowcasting and forecasting quarterly GDP growth in the euro area on a monthly basis, using a set of about 20 monthly indicators. It turns out that the two approaches are more complements than substitutes, since MIDAS tends to perform better for horizons up to four to five months, whereas MF-VAR performs better for longer horizons, up to nine months.

The results are determined by the relative size of the x-inefficiencies of the public monopolist, allocative inefficiencies of the private monopoly, the cost of unbundling and the costs related to establishing a competitive market.</p>"

<p>Evidence is provided on the relationship between changes in product characteristics and product prices by constructing constant quality price indexes for hubs, a category of equipment for Local Area Networks (LANs). Relying on a database of more than 500 hubs marketed between 1990 and 1999 estimations of pooled hedonic regression are carried out and then 'augmented' by interacting some characteristics. Results show a general decline of constant-quality price in the period analysed with distinct patterns between the first and the second half of the decade. In particular, evidence of 'technologically induced' disequilibrium in the first half of the decade is found. Equilibrium prevailed instead in the second half. Also, results show that both the extent of technological improvements and the extent of economic benefits from technological improvements have been unevenly distributed across technological characteristics.

<p>In a study of 133 volunteer subjects, demographic, physiologic and pharmacokinetic data through exposure to 1,3-Butadiene (BD) were collected in order to estimate the percentage of BD concentration metabolized at steady state, and to determine whether this percentage varies across gender, racial, and age groups. During the 20 min of continuous exposure to 2 parts per million (ppm) of BD, five measurements of exhaled concentration were made on each subject. In the following 40 min washout period, another five measurements were collected. A Bayesian hierarchical compartmental physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model (PKPB) was used. Using prior information on the model parameters, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation was conducted to obtain posterior distributions. The overall estimate of the mean percent of BD metabolized at steady state was 12.7% (95% credible interval: 7.7-17.8%). There was no significant difference in gender with males having a mean of 13.5%, and females 12.3%. Among the racial groups, Hispanic (13.9%), White (13.0%), Asian (12.1%), and Black (10.9%), the significant difference came from the difference between Black and Hispanic with a 95% credible interval from -5.63 to -0.30%. Those older than 30 years had a mean of 12.2% versus 12.9% for the younger group; although this was not a statistically significant difference. Given a constant inhalation input of 2 ppm, at steady state, the overall mean exhaled concentration was estimated to be 1.75ppm (95% credible interval: 1.64-1.84). An equivalent parameter, first-order metabolic rate constant, was also estimated and found to be consistent with the percent of BD metabolized at steady state across gender, race, and age strata.</p>"

<p>Background: Goal ambiguity influences the effectiveness of performance management systems to drive organizations toward enhanced results. The literature analyzes the antecedents of goal ambiguity and shows the influence of goal ambiguity on the performance of U. S. federal agencies. However, no study has analyzed goal ambiguity in other countries or in health care systems.</p>
<p>Purpose: This study has three aims: to test the validity of a measurement instrument for goal ambiguity, to investigate its main antecedents, and to explore the relationship between goal ambiguity and organizational performance in a large, public, Beveridge-type health care system.</p>
<p>Methodology: A nationwide survey of general managers of the Italian national health system was performed. A factor analysis was used to validate the mono-dimensionality of an instrument that measured goal ambiguity. Structural equation modeling was used to test both the antecedents and the influence of goal ambiguity on organizational performance.</p>
<p>Results: Data from 135 health care organizations (53% response rate) were available for analysis. The results confirm the mono-dimensionality of the instrument, the existence of two environmental sources of ambiguity (political endorsement and governance commitment), and the negative relationship between goal ambiguity and organizational performance.</p>
<p>Practice Implications: Goal ambiguity matters because it may hamper organizational performance. Therefore, performance should be fostered by reducing goal ambiguity (e.g., goal-setting model, funding arrangements, and political support). Mutatis mutandis, our results may apply to public health care systems of other countries or other ""public interest'' sectors, such as social care and education.</p>"

We illustrate the procedure by implementing four test cases with different model structures and model input distributions. Numerical experiments are performed at increasing sample size to check convergence of the sensitivity estimates to the analytical values.</p>"

<p>The new member states (NMS) of the European Union must comply with the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and the investment goals implied by the Lisbon Agenda. However, the SGP rules may result in underinvestment or distortions in the allocation of public expenditure. This paper provides new evidence on the effects of debt sustainability and the SGP fiscal constraints on government expenditure on fixed capital, education and health in OECD countries by estimating government expenditure reaction functions to public debt and cyclical conditions. We find that, at high levels of debt, government capital expenditure and education expenditure are significantly reduced as the debt ratio increases in all OECD countries independently of EMU (or EU) membership. By contrast, neither capital expenditure nor education expenditure is affected by the debt ratio in low-debt countries. These findings are robust to the inclusion of the government deficit in the estimated reaction functions. Hence, it appears that EU countries have been constrained in their investment decisions more by the need to ensure debt sustainability than by the rules of the SGP. In low-debt NMS countries, public investment even increases with the debt ratio, a finding that is reassuring for their growth prospects. However, a less optimistic picture emerges when we focus on expenditures on public health and education, as it appears that NMS governments cut such expenditures - even at low levels of debt - as the deficit increases. Problems in controlling total expenditure together with the preventive arm of the SGP may have penalised investment in human capital in the NMS while leaving fixed capital investment unaffected.</p>"

<p>Do bond investors price hidden information? To address this question, we use a heteroscedastic regression model to empirically examine the factors affecting the spread dispersion unexplained by easy-to-observe issue characteristics (such as credit ratings, size, maturity, etc.). Two main results emerge from the empirical analysis. First, variables that accurately predict the spread of the typical bond lose their explanatory power for worse-rated, subordinated bonds with longer maturity and smaller face value. This result suggests that investors price hidden information. Secondly, unexplained spread dispersion increases for open-priced offers and decreases with the number of banks involved in the syndicate, indicating that primary market characteristics affect the investors' ability to uncover hidden information.</p>"

<p>Continuous monitoring of the evolution of the economy is fundamental for the decisions of public and private decision makers. The paper proposes EUROMIND, which is a new monthly indicator of the euro area economic conditions, based on tracking real gross domestic product monthly, relying on information provided in the Eurostat Euro-IND database. EUROMIND has several original economic and statistical features. First, it considers both the output and the expenditure sides of the economy, as it provides a monthly estimate of the value added of the six branches of economic activity and of the main gross domestic product components by type of expenditure (final consumption, gross capital formation and net exports), and combines the estimates with optimal weights reflecting their relative precision. Second, the indicator is based on information at both the monthly and the quarterly level, modelled with a dynamic factor specification cast in state space form. Third, since estimation of the multivariate dynamic factor model with mixed frequency data can be numerically complex, computational efficiency is achieved by implementing univariate filtering and smoothing procedures. Finally, special attention is paid to chain linking and its implications, via a multistep procedure that exploits the additivity of the volume measures expressed at the prices of the previous year.</p>"

<p>In the consumer research literature, the automatic consideration of one's knowledge of self in the evaluation of others is taken for granted. The 'idea of the other' - which the authors here term 'representational subjectivity' - is at the heart of consumer decisions. Philosopher Emanuel Levinas suggests another path: the concrete relation to the other person is the basis of subjectivity. He makes the distinction between 'other' (as in environment and things) and 'Others' as in persons. Affective subjectivity arises in the enjoyment of things around an individual and precedes representation. Ethical subjectivity makes an individual realize that not everything can be assimilated to the self. It is in this moment that ethical subjectivity is realized. The authors explain these themes in the realm of beauty, a domain where ongoing moral judgments are made. The authors offer a correction to the taken-for-granted relationship between the self and the other with a focus on the pre-reflective affective self and the ethical self, each of which is shaken out of its complacency with the appearance of another person.</p>"

<p>This paper contributes to the induced innovation literature by extending the analysis of supply and demand determinants of innovation in energy technologies to account for international knowledge flows and spillovers. We select a sample of 38 innovating countries and study how knowledge related to energy-efficient and environmentally friendly technologies flows across geographical and technological space. We demonstrate that higher geographical and technological distances are associated with lower probabilities of knowledge flow. Next, we use previous estimates to construct internal and external knowledge stocks for a panel of 17 countries. We then present an econometric analysis of the supply and demand determinants of innovation accounting for international knowledge spillovers. Our results confirm the role of demand-pull effects, proxied by energy prices, and of technological opportunity, proxied by the knowledge stocks. Our results show that spillovers between countries have a significant positive impact on further innovation in energy-efficient and environmentally friendly technologies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

These forms of government have been a matter of serious study by political scientists, but not by accountants. This study examines the phenomenon of budget setting in political coalitions and minority governments by drawing on the ideas of negotiated order (Strauss) and circuits of power (Clegg) and focussing on the life of the Scottish Parliament (1999-2009). It offers evidence of stability in the exercise of power in coalition governments and of the fragmentary nature of a negotiated social order in budget setting in minority government. More general observations on government budget setting are also made. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p>"

To investigate if and how organizations can also use new and diverse cultural resources, we undertook a historical case study of the incorporation of new cultural resources in the cultural repertoire of the Italian manufacturer of household products Alessi. Through in-depth analysis of four rounds of incorporation of new cultural resources, we develop a robust theoretical model that relates the use of new cultural resources to the development of unconventional strategies and strategic versatility. We find that cultural repertoire enrichment and organizational identity redefinition are two core mechanisms that facilitate this process. The model contributes novel theoretical understanding regarding the use of cultural resources in strategy formation and change.</p>"

We suggest that these outcomes impact on the motivation of potential offenders to act or make it more difficult for them to justify their illegal intentions; the same outcomes of CSR also influence stakeholders who do not participate in crime but can develop attitudes and behaviours that restrict opportunities for criminal action by potential offenders. We also suggest that these crime-reducing effects of CSR vary according to whether the offenders belong to a legitimate stakeholder category or not, and according to the legitimate or non-legitimate nature of the claim they advance through their illegal actions.

In order to change this image, public management reforms have largely focused on civil servants since the 1990s. However, many academics and practitioners claim some inertia in the reform implementation. In this article we aim to identify the determinants of such inertia in Italy's civil service reforms and we analyze data from 885 Italian municipalities expected to adopt the pay system reform for senior officials, as required by national legislature. Our findings stress the importance of accrued legitimacy, external public endorsement, and the influence of key internal stakeholders (like administrative leaders) as major vehicles to promote or slow down the implementation of administrative reforms in the public sector.</p>"

<p>In this paper, we advance and test the idea that innovation and export are complementary strategies for SMEs' growth. We argue that innovation and export positively reinforce each other in a dynamic virtuous circle, and we identify and describe the process through which this complementarity relationship takes place. Participating in export markets can promote firms' learning, and thus enhance innovation performance. At the same time, through innovation, firms can enter new geographical markets with novel and better products, therefore making exports more successful, and, by the same token, they can also improve the quality - and consequently increase the sales of the products sold domestically. We test our theory using an unbalanced panel of Spanish manufacturing firms over the period 1990-1999. We find robust empirical support for our hypothesis: consistent with the presence of complementarity, we show that the positive effect of innovation activity on firms' growth rate is higher for firms that also engage in exports, and vice versa. Furthermore, we show that, Ceteris paribus, firms' adoption of one growth strategy (e.g., entering export markets) positively influences the adoption of the other (e.g., innovation).

<p>P>This paper reports a longitudinal field study on the effects of positive media coverage on the reconstruction of organizational identity. The study highlights how intense positive coverage - to the point of turning an organization into a 'celebrity' - influences both the way members understand their organization (sensemaking effect) and the gratification they derive from its positive representation (self-enhancement effect). Our findings suggest that positive media representations foster members' alignment around an emergent new understanding of what their organization is. Over time, however, celebrity may 'captivate' members' organizational identity beliefs and understandings, and impede further identity work as media persist in the replication of representations that differ from members' experienced reality, but are too appealing to them to be publicly contradicted.</p>"

<p>Recent theories about social and demographic change, such as individualization and the Second Demographic Transition, embed the notion of a convergence towards a specific ideal-typical pathway to adulthood, which we define as late, protracted and complex. After a discussion of the relevant literature for and against such an idea, we empirically assess the convergence to this ideal-typical pattern using new retrospective data from the European Social Survey wave 3 (ESS-3). Our analysis of the timing and sequencing of demographic events among young adults offers qualified support for the emergence of a new pattern of transition to adulthood. Pathways to adulthood are changing in the same direction in most parts of Europe, but no convergence of trends is observed (yet). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Youth is often depicted as a transition from childhood to adulthood in the familial, residential and occupational domains. This approach brings in the idea of thresholds, such as leaving the parental home, getting married, having a first child or having a stable job. In practice, it has the advantage of allowing relatively simple comparisons of pathways to adulthood in time and space. However the study of thresholds has several limitations. First, it masks the problem of the reversibility of events, their non-occurrence and the difficulty of defining clearly bounded markers. Second, it barely apprehends the links between the familial, residential and occupational domains. Finally, it produces aggregated outcomes, partly ignoring the heterogeneity of individual processes of transition to adulthood. This work attempts to overcome these limitations by tackling pathways to adulthood in France through trajectory typologies built by means of optimal matching analysis techniques.

<p>This article focuses on the time frame of intentions to have a child. For both parents and childless people we compare those who want a child now with those who intend to have a child within the next three years. Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and using data from Norway (N = 1307), we investigate the role of attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control on these two different time frames in fertility intention. The results show that subjective norms have a significant effect on the timing of intentions to have a child for both childless people and parents: the more both groups feel that their intention to have a child is supported by their families and friends, the more likely they are to want a child now compared to within the next three years. It also shows that positive attitudes have a significant effect on intending to have a child now rather than later for parents but not for childless people. Perceived behavioural control is a significant determinant for both groups: people who consider themselves better able to cope with having child are more likely to intend to have a child now rather than within the next three years. But this effect disappears when we control for demographic background variables, suggesting that the effect of perceived control on the timing of having a child varies considerably with personal circumstances.

<p>This study updates previous work on modelling the incidence of varicella and Herpes Zoster (HZ) following the introduction of childhood vaccination. The updated model includes new data on age-specific contact patterns, as well as data on the efficacy of zoster vaccination in the elderly and allows for HZ among vaccinees. The current study also looks at two-dose varicella childhood programmes, and assesses the combined impact of varicella vaccination in childhood and zoster vaccination of the elderly. The results suggest that a two-dose schedule is likely to reduce the incidence of varicella to very low levels, provided first dose coverage is around 90% and second dose coverage is in excess of 70%. Single dose varicella vaccination programmes are expected to result in large numbers of breakthrough cases. Childhood vaccination is expected to increase the incidence of zoster for more than 40 years after introduction of the programme, the magnitude of this increase being influenced primarily by the duration of boosting following exposure to the varicella zoster virus. Though this increase in zoster incidence can be partly offset by vaccination of the elderly, the effectiveness of this combined strategy is limited, as much of the increase occurs in those adults too young to be vaccinated. Childhood vaccination at intermediate levels of coverage (70% and 60% for first and second dose coverage respectively) is expected to lead to an increase in adult varicella. At high coverage (90% and 80% coverage) this is unlikely to be the case. These results will be used to inform a cost-effectiveness analysis of combined varicella and zoster vaccination programmes.

<p>This paper explores how pressures for an increased decentralization of taxing powers to sub-national governments may affect the degree of income redistribution across regional territories accomplished by the Italian NHS. In Italy, political responsibilities for health care are decentralized to regional governments, but the central government retains a critical role in ensuring all citizens uniform access to health services. To this end the central government runs an expenditure needs equalizing system to top up regional governments own resources. However, this system is currently put under question by strong political pressures calling for a weakening of central government involvement. Applying a well developed econometric approach we find that the NHS currently reduces interregional differences in per-capita income by about 7% of GDP. A reform of the NHS in terms of a reduction of expenditure standards produces a weakening of redistribution across jurisdictions, the size of which crucially depends on the financing arrangements of health care that will be actually adopted. We conclude that the decentralization of the NHS would give rise to relevant policy issues concerning in particular the different health care spending possibilities across regions and the impact on the interregional mobility of patients.

<p>Is electoral competition good for political selection? To address this issue, we introduce a theoretical model where ideological parties select and allocate high-valence (experts) and low-valence (party loyalists) candidates into electoral districts. Voters care about a national policy (e. g., party ideology) and the valence of their district's candidates. High-valence candidates are more costly for the parties to recruit. We show that parties compete by selecting and allocating good politicians to the most contestable districts. Empirical evidence on Italian members of parliament confirms this prediction: politicians with higher ex ante quality, measured by years of schooling, previous market income, and local government experience, are more likely to run in contestable districts. Indeed, despite being different on average, politicians belonging to opposite political coalitions converge to high-quality levels in close electoral races. Furthermore, politicians elected in contestable districts have fewer absences in parliament, due to a selection effect more than to reelection incentives.</p>"

<p>Managers are more and more interested in social networking sites because they provide opportunities for strengthening relationships with customers as well as site content and service. Using social networking sites effectively, however, depends on understanding both the psychological attributes and social interactions of participants. This paper addresses these topics by presenting the results of a two-study inquiry into the importance of two personality traits (consumer innovativeness and expressiveness) to active and passive use of social networks among Italian consumers. In Study 1 (n = 753) it was found that innovativeness is positively related to active and passive use. Study 2 (n = 277) revealed that self-identity expressiveness and social identity expressiveness positively influence only active use. These results suggest that managers need to distinguish between, and differentially encourage, joining and browsing such sites on the one hand and actively contributing to them on the other. Managers can also enhance the impact of their social networking sites by taking into account social and self-identity expressiveness to increase affiliation and market share and by encouraging consumers to use these sites actively.

<p>The paper investigates the factors associated with the intensity of use of three Web 2.0 services - video sharing, social networking and social bookmarking - by looking at the users characteristics and at the technological features. It relies upon a theoretical framework that combines the diffusion of innovation model with the technology acceptance model. However, it goes beyond them by focusing not simply on the determinants of adoption, but on the determinants of the intensity of use, and by introducing variables related to the social influence. The empirical analysis is based upon a survey of 300 users of Web 2.0 services. We find that the compatibility with users' needs and behaviours plays an important role for the intensity of usage of both video sharing and social networking services, while the ease of use positively affects the intensity of usage of social networking services, but has a negative effect on the intensity of usage of video sharing services. Extrinsic job-related motivations are important drivers of the intensive usage of social bookmarking and social networking services, while sharing contents is relevant for video sharing and social networking services. Finally, individual characteristics such as age, education and IT endowment also play an important role. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This paper investigates the determinants of consumer attitudes toward organic products marketed by mainstream retailers under a private label. Since organic products are credence goods, consumers cannot directly verify whether these products comply with official standards. Organic labels are the primary source of consumer trust in organics, but these labels must be noticed and understood before consumers will actively seek them out. In that some consumers may not prioritize product labels when they shop, it is sometimes up to retailers to strengthen consumer trust. Within the antecedents of this trust, we isolated the contribution of the corporate social responsibility associations held by consumers about retailers. We surveyed Italian customers interested in organics and found that they are more likely to trust the private-label organic products sold by a retailer when it is considered socially responsible. Our results also show that consumer trust translates into brand loyalty and a willingness to pay a premium price for organic products.

The results, based upon 206 Italian and 201 US consumers surveyed via a mall-intercept approach, indicate that novelty is a more important dimension of product creativity in the US (i.e., a low-resultant conservative/high-resultant self-enhancement culture) than in Italy (i.e., a high-resultant conservatism/low-resultant self-enhancement culture) in influencing intention to buy and that meaningfulness is a more important dimension of creativity in Italy than in the US in influencing intention to buy.

<p>Achieving the MDG goal of reducing world poverty by 50% by 2015 requires the cooperative effort of many disciplines. To date the discipline of organizational psychology has not played as significant a role as it might in this endeavor. With the recent establishment of the Global Task Force for Humanitarian Work Psychology, this discipline signaled its commitment to the global effort. Organizational psychology offers to bring its expertise to poverty reduction: its ability to assess needs and capacity, develop partnerships with stakeholders, bring about and manage change, and systematically review, evaluate, monitor and revise high level mandates, policy development, program implementation and consultation on personnel issues. Its successes as practitioners-scientists in private enterprise will enhance its credibility for success in the public sphere.

<p>The market types that were the subject of an earlier essay in the Review are resurveyed in order to examine the changes that have occurred over the past fifty years. The entrepreneurial typologies identified then-one based on a market orientation, another that relies on state support, and a third, hybrid, approach-are still valid today. The liveliest components of the modern Italian economy, which operate as a fourth type of capitalism (mainly based on industrial districts), share features of the market typology, while, in southern Italy, the state's failure to support business is linked to the rise of organized crime. The more recent hybrid type features a new kind of actor, exemplified by Silvio Berlusconi, the central figure on the Italian political scene for almost two decades.</p>"

<p>For a variety of reasons, the demand and supply of healthcare services is changing daily and expenditure on healthcare services is increasing with rates well above those of the gross domestic product in most countries, regardless of geography, economic development, and population health status. As resources are scarce, it is necessary to ensure that they are allocated in uses that maximize overall health societal benefit. Economic evaluation of healthcare technologies and interventions is a tool designed to assist decision makers in allocating budgets in ways that will maximize value for money spent.

<p>Health technology assessment (HTA) is the multidisciplinary field of policy analysis that studies medical, social, ethical, and economic implications of the development, diffusion, and use of health technologies. Its worldwide diffusion needs to be understood in the context of evidence-based healthcare delivery policy, and it is strongly driven by the search for new cost-containment policies by the governments of universal healthcare systems. This article presents the three main pillars of HTA: evaluating comparative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and organizational impact. While comparative analysis is more familiar to cardiologists, cost-effectiveness and organizational studies are less widely known because they expand the perspective of the evaluation to institutional settings and society at large and require significant interdisciplinary work. Sound economic and organizational studies that extend comparative effectiveness studies may facilitate dialogue between medical science and policymaking.</p>"

<p>As in other settings, in the field of clinical use of cardiac implantable electrical devices (CIEDs), the implementation, in various ways, of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) has created new scenarios in most European healthcare systems. A DRG system is primarily a financial tool with the aim of promoting efficiency and improving utilization of resources. However, there are a variety of ways in which this system is used for funding the activity of centres implanting CIEDs. It is possible that the specific type and method of reimbursement may influence the implementation of CIEDs in the 'real world' through a variable spectrum of practices. These may range from the situation where reimbursement may, together with other factors, constitute a true barrier to the implementation of guidelines, to scenarios where reimbursement is adequate, and/or to situations where reimbursement may be adequate for standard devices but not for prompt implementation of effective technological innovations. The variety in reimbursement also affects how in-office checks of CIEDs are covered and, above all, the possibility to pay for remote follow-up of CIEDs. In the field of medical devices, refinement of DRG systems and adoption of new strategies and policies are needed to sustain and enhance those effective technological innovations that may be beneficial for specific patient populations. It is also important that physicians are deeply involved in the development and deployment of DRGs, and that each country DRGs agency has a transparent approach to engagement with stakeholders, along with robust and transparent mechanisms for updating these systems.</p>"

<p>A Dirichlet mixture of exponential power distributions, as a prior on densities supported on the real line in the problem of Bayesian density estimation, is a natural generalization of a Dirichlet mixture of normals, which has been shown to possess good frequentist asymptotic properties in terms of posterior consistency and rates of convergence. In this article, we establish upper bounds on the rates of convergence for the posterior distribution of a Dirichlet mixture of exponential power densities, assuming that the true density has the same form as the model. When the kernel is analytic and the mixing distribution has either compact support or sub-exponential tails, an early parametric rate, up to alogarithmic factor whose exponent depends on the tail behaviour of the base measure of the Dirichlet process and the exponential decay rate at zero of the prior for the scale parameter, is obtained. The result covers the important special case where the true density is a location mixture of normals and shows that an early parametric rate a rises also when the prior on the scale contains zero in its support, provided it has a sufficiently fast decay rate at zero. This improves on some recent results on density estimation with Dirichlet mixtures of normals by allowing the inverse-gamma distribution, which is a commonly used prior on the square of the bandwidth. When the kernel is not infinitely differentiable at zero, as the case may be depending on the shape parameter, the posterior distribution is shown to concentrate around the sampling density at a slower rate.</p>"

<p>This paper investigates the extent to which rationalizable implementation depends on the implicit common knowledge restrictions usually embodied in traditional models. It is shown that under fairly general conditions such restrictions are without loss of generality in the following sense: If a mechanism M implements a social choice function f on a type space X, then M implements f assuming only that the agents k-order beliefs are among those described by an open set B containing X, while higher-order beliefs are completely unrestricted. The result is applied to direct implementation on payoff type spaces, and related to the weak (incentive compatible) implementation problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Heeding the call for a deeper understanding of how cross-sector social partnerships (CSSPs) can be managed across different contexts, this article integrates ideas from institutional theory with current debate on cross-boundary collaboration. Adopting the point of view of business actors interested in forming a CSSP to address complex social problems, we suggest that ""appropriateness"" needs shape business approaches toward partnering for social change, exerting an impact on the benefits that can be gained from it. A theoretical framework is proposed that identifies and frames four CSSP styles, as resulting from combinations of dominant institutional orientations in a field and its general level of coherence. We show how, depending on prevailing institutional logics, intervention models underlying the CSSP have to emphasize either the business soundness of the initiative or its social value, together with a consistent leadership style. Moreover, while directive approaches based on concentrated governance structures aimed at setting the rules of the game are shown to prevail in fields characterized by low level of institutional coherence, participative models emerge in more established fields, with CSSP's promoter playing an integrative role through distributed governance structures. The article concludes with a summary and implications of an institutional-based view of CSSPs.</p>"

<p>A large body of empirical literature indicates that, contrary to predictions from economic theory, wages in the informal sector increase after a minimum wage hike. This phenomenon was so far explained as a byproduct of a signal (a lighthouse) conveyed by statutory minima to wage setting in the informal sector. A simple matching model shows that an increase in wages in the informal sector may also be induced by significant sorting and composition effects between the formal and the shadow sectors in the aftermath of the increase in the minimum wage. Using data on Brazil, we find that sorting accounts for at least one third of the increase in average wages in the informal sector after a minimum wage hike. This contribution of endogenous sorting to wage dynamics in the informal sector is also increasing over time.</p>"

<p>We investigate how self-monitoring combines with the degree of perceived job autonomy to affect contextual performance. We explore both a mediation model, built on theories on individual differences in the perception of job characteristics, and a moderation model, built on theories of the interaction between personality and perceived job situation. Empirical evidence suggests that self-monitoring and perceived job autonomy significantly predict contextual performance. In addition, an interesting paradox emerges: high self-monitors are likely to perceive higher job autonomy than low self-monitors but appear to benefit less from perceiving high job autonomy than low self-monitors. This paper provides a richer understanding of the controversial nature of the self-monitoring construct and offers a new specification of the combination between perceived situational and personality variables in the prediction of behavioural outcomes.</p>"

<p>Background: Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are potential instruments to enable private collaboration in the health sector. Despite theoretical debate, empirical analyses have thus far tended to focus on the contractual or project dimension, overlooking institutional PPPs, i.e., formal legal entities run by proper corporate-governance mechanisms and jointly owned by public and private parties for the provision of public-health goods. This work aims to fill this gap by carrying out a comparative analysis of the reasons for the adoption of institutional PPPs and the governance and managerial features necessary to establish them as appropriate arrangements for public-health services provisions.</p>
<p>Methods: A qualitative analysis is carried out on experiences of institutional PPPs within the Italian National Health Service (Sistema Sanitario Nazionale, SSN). The research question is addressed through a contextual and comparative embedded case study design, assuming the entire population of PPPs (4) currently in force in one Italian region as the unit of analysis: (i) a rehabilitation hospital, (ii), an orthopaedic-centre, (iii) a primary care and ambulatory services facility, and (iv) a health-and social-care facility. Internal validity is guaranteed by the triangulation of sources in the data collection phase, which included archival and interview data.</p>
<p>Results: Four governance and managerial issues were found to be critical in determining the positive performance of the case examined: (i) a strategic market orientation to a specialised service area with sufficient potential demand, (ii) the allocation of public capital assets and the consistent financial involvement of the private partner, (iii) the adoption of private administrative procedures in a regulated setting while guaranteeing the respect of public administration principles, and (iv) clear regulation of the workforce to align the contracts with the organisational culture.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Findings suggests that institutional PPPs enable national health services to reap great benefits when introduced as a complement to the traditional public-service provisions for a defined set of services and goals.</p>"

<p>Since the 1990s Europe and other continents have been organising a significantly larger number of festivals with the objective of stimulating tourism and exploiting potential economic opportunities. The prominence of these events has led to intense competition between festivals in attracting visitors and it has become important to analyse factors which might influence attendees' retention. Drawing on existing literature on retail and service sectors, this study aims to identify the role played by emotions, hedonism, satisfaction, and social identification in mediating the effects of environmental factors on attendees' re-patronizing intention. This study includes an on-site survey of 449 visitors attending an Italian festival gaining in popularity, and analyses data using a structural equations model.

We compare four policy regimes: laissez faire, ex-post penalties and two forms of authorization - lenient and strict. If fines are unbounded, laissez faire is optimal if the social harm from innovation is sufficiently unlikely; otherwise, regulation should impose increasing penalties as innovation becomes more dangerous. If fines are bounded by limited liability, for intermediate levels of expected social harm it is optimal to adopt (indifferently) penalties or lenient authorization, while strict authorization becomes optimal if social harm is sufficiently likely.

<p>During periods of strategic change, maintaining the congruence between new configurations of resources and activities (strategic investments) and how these new configurations are communicated to external organizational constituents (strategic projections) is an important task facing organizational leaders. One part of this activity is to manage organizational identity to ensure that the various strategic projections produced by organizational members are coherent and support the new strategic investments. Little is known, however, about how organizational leaders accomplish this crucial task. This study of strategic change at Bang & Olufsen highlights the different strategies available to organizational leaders to ensure members' identity beliefs are aligned with their own beliefs about the distinctive and appealing organizational features that result from the new strategic investments and result in appropriate strategic projections. The study's findings highlight the internal identity work - or identity management - that organizational leaders engage in to preserve this congruence. The findings also complement the current emphasis in the literature on the social validation of organizational identities by pointing to the importance of a connection between identity claims and beliefs, strategic projections and the material reality of organizational products, practices and structures.</p>"

<p>Background: Several decision support tools have been developed to aid policymaking regarding the adoption of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) into national pediatric immunization programs. The lack of critical appraisal of these tools makes it difficult for decision makers to understand and choose between them. With the aim to guide policymakers on their optimal use, we compared publicly available decision-making tools in relation to their methods, influential parameters and results.</p>
<p>Methods: The World Health Organization (WHO) requested access to several publicly available cost-effectiveness (CE) tools for PCV from both public and private provenance. All tools were critically assessed according to the WHO's guide for economic evaluations of immunization programs. Key attributes and characteristics were compared and a series of sensitivity analyses was performed to determine the main drivers of the results. The results were compared based on a standardized set of input parameters and assumptions.</p>
<p>Results: Three cost-effectiveness modeling tools were provided, including two cohort-based (Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) ProVac Initiative TriVac, and PneumoADIP) and one population-based model (GlaxoSmithKline's SUPREMES). They all compared the introduction of PCV into national pediatric immunization program with no PCV use. The models were different in terms of model attributes, structure, and data requirement, but captured a similar range of diseases. Herd effects were estimated using different approaches in each model. The main driving parameters were vaccine efficacy against pneumococcal pneumonia, vaccine price, vaccine coverage, serotype coverage and disease burden. With a standardized set of input parameters developed for cohort modeling, TriVac and PneumoADIP produced similar incremental costs and health outcomes, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Vaccine cost (dose price and number of doses), vaccine efficacy and epidemiology of critical endpoint (for example, incidence of pneumonia, distribution of serotypes causing pneumonia) were influential parameters in the models we compared. Understanding the differences and similarities of such CE tools through regular comparisons could render decision-making processes in different countries more efficient, as well as providing guiding information for further clinical and epidemiological research. A tool comparison exercise using standardized data sets can help model developers to be more transparent about their model structure and assumptions and provide analysts and decision makers with a more in-depth view behind the disease dynamics. Adherence to the WHO guide of economic evaluations of immunization programs may also facilitate this process. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/9/55</p>"

The paper aims to compare this experience with similar experiences of Western local authorities described in the literature by analysing drivers, motivations, benefits and barriers in EMS adoption. To achieve this goal, the paper reports, among other results, the outcome of a survey of the environmental perception of the City population carried out in the ISO 14001 implementation in order to identify how and if the attainment of ISO 14001 certification could be valorised by the City of Marrakech with regard to the citizens' perception. From this enquiry it emerges that a relevant sensibility of the population related to numerous environmental issues can be stimulated by ISO 14001 certification. The case study shows that an approach foreseeing a strong involvement of the stakeholders can be particularly effective as it responds to the specificities of non-EU contexts.</p>"

<p>The article studies the intensity of usage of VoIP, analysing individual data on a sample of UK consumers collected by OFCOM in 2006. In particular, it examines the role of firms' strategies in affecting the intensity of usage and the degree of substitution/complementarity between VoIP and other communications means. It investigates the importance of firms' strategies and compares pure players with the network-based operators, in order to understand whether the existence of bundling offerings as opposed to very low prices may drive consumers of specific companies to use the service more intensively. The results show that, once the control for the characteristics of VoIP providers is included, the customers of telecom operators are more likely to use intensively VoIP services, suggesting that the subscription to bundled service can attract consumers to value added services. Furthermore, those who use frequently VoIP services exploit the PC-to-telephone and Phone-to-Phone functionality suggesting that usage intensity is associated with a higher sophistication of the users more than with the existence of local effects on PC-to-PC applications. Finally, age and work conditions also play a role with respect to the intensity of VoIP usage. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>We consider the general class of discrete-time, finite-horizon intertemporal asset pricing models in which preferences for consumption at the intermediate dates are allowed to be state-dependent, satiated, non-convex and discontinuous, and the information structure is not required to be generated by a Markov process of state variables. We supply a generalized definition of marginal utility of wealth based on the Frechet differential of the value operator that maps time t wealth into maximum conditional remaining utility. We show that in this general case all state-price densities/stochastic discount factors are fully characterized by the marginal utility of wealth of optimizing agents even if their preferences for intermediate consumption are highly irregular. Our result requires only the strict monotonicity of preferences for terminal wealth and the existence of a portfolio with positive and bounded gross returns. We also relate our generalized notion of marginal utility of wealth to the equivalent martingale measures/risk-neutral probabilities commonly employed in derivative asset pricing theory. We supply an example in which our characterization holds while the standard representation of state-price densities in terms of marginal utilities of optimal consumption fails. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

<p>Estimating the effect of aging on productivity requires clean measures of productivity. Additionally, one needs to control for unobserved heterogeneity at the worker, firm and worker/firm level, to account for the role of experience and to correct for selection bias. We tackle these issues exploiting a panel of Gran Prix Formula One drivers, which provides a unique setting to single out the data requirements needed to credibly estimate the effect of age on productivity. Results robust to the inclusion of worker, firm and match effects show that the age-productivity link has an inverted U-shape profile with a peak at the age of 30-32. The use of repeated cross-sections of individuals also produces consistent results provided that cohort effects are properly accounted for. Relying on team-average measures of productivity makes instead inference harder. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>We analyze whether companies involved in a security class action suit (SCAS) exhibit differential capital structure decisions, and if the information revealed by a corporate scandal affects the security issuances and stock prices of industry peers. Our findings show that before a SCAS is filed, companies involved in a scandal show a greater amount of security offerings than their peers and, due to equity mispricing, are more likely to use equity as a financing mechanism. Following a SCAS filing, these companies exhibit a decreasing amount of total external finance raised and lower levels of book and market leverage. Industry peers' issuance patterns exhibit significant contagion, with reduced debt and equity issuance following the SCAS filing. Corporate scandals also have meaningful negative effects on stock prices and bond ratings. Similar to capital structure, we document contagion at the industry level with peers' share prices yielding negative returns as well.</p>"

<p>This paper provides evidence on the reliability of euro area real-time output gap estimates. A genuine real-time data set for the euro area is used, including vintages of several sets of euro area output gap estimates available from 1999 to 2010. It turns out that real-time estimates of the output gap tend to be characterised by a high degree of uncertainty, much higher than that resulting from model and estimation uncertainty only. In particular, the evidence indicates that both the magnitude and the sign of the real-time estimates of the euro area output gap are very uncertain. The uncertainty is mostly due to parameter instability and model uncertainty, while data revisions seem to play a minor role. Some euro area real-time measures, based on multivariate components models and capacity utilisation, are relatively less uncertain, but do not appear to be fully reliable along some dimensions. To benchmark our results, we repeat the analysis for the US over the same sample. It turns out that US real-time estimates tend to be revised to a lesser extent than euro area estimates. However, euro area real-time output gap estimates tend to display a higher correlation with the final estimates and the sign of the level of US real-time estimates tends to be revised more often compared to the corresponding euro area estimates. In addition, the data revision component of the revision error is larger for US estimates than for the euro area. Overall, the unreliability in real-time of the US output gap measures detected in earlier studies is confirmed in the more recent period. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This paper analyses the two most important international programmes for the voluntary regulation of corporate behaviour: the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Corporations and the UN Global Compact. It argues that international organizations adopted them mostly for reasons of political feasibility: by imposing minimal constraints on constituents the codes circumvented the most pressing problems of political acceptability associated with standard setting. It finds no clear evidence, however, that the network solutions adopted are technically more effective than traditional forms of regulation. The paper concludes that while it is unlikely that corporate behaviour will change simply as a result of participation in these programmes, if the programmes increase their ability to consistently discriminate between good and bad performers, the resulting 'soft' sanctioning power has the potential to alter corporate behaviour in the long run.</p>"

<p>The article deals with the differential domestic employment policy adaptation to the European Employment Strategy that occurred over the past years in two European countries-Italy and France. Building on the Europeanization and welfare state change literature, the contribution operationalizes the ""goodness of fit"" hypothesis and develops a ""policy structure"" approach for the analysis of domestic employment policy change. The main argument is that domestic adaptation to the European Union depends primarily on the preferences of key institutional and social actors, and not on the specific design of domestic institutions. More in general, the article not only supports the validity of the misfit hypothesis but also shows how the nature and intensity of domestic preferences do explain differential patterns of adaptation to Europe (policy transformation in the Italian case, policy adjustment in the French case) in similar conditions of policy ""misfit.""</p>"

<p>This paper provides a quantitative assessment of the scientific and technological productivity of FP6 projects by exploiting a new database on articles and patents resulting from EU funded projects. Starting from the FP6, the design of the European technology policy has undergone significant changes with the introduction of new funding instruments aimed at achieving a ""critical mass'' of resources. Our empirical results provide support to the concerns, expressed by several observers, regarding the fact that the new funding instruments may have resulted in artificially ""too large'' research consortia. The available empirical evidence shows that scientific productivity increases with the number of participants following a U-inverted shape, thereby indicating the existence of decreasing marginal returns to an increase in the size of research consortia. A second key result of the paper is related to the existence of significant differences of performance among funding instruments. In particular, after accounting for the larger amount of resources allocated to them, Integrated Projects perform less well in terms of scientific output than both STRePs and Networks of Excellence and they do not exhibit a superior performance than STRePs in terms of patent applications.</p>"

<p>Manuscript Type: Empirical</p>
<p>Research Question/Issue: Boards' involvement in strategy is generally seen to be an indicator of board effectiveness, but less is known about the relationship between board leadership and strategy involvement, especially in small firms.This study analyzes board leadership from a team production perspective as an antecedent to board strategy involvement in small firms.</p>
<p>Research Findings/Insights: Using survey data from 140 small firms in Norway collected in two different time periods, we demonstrate that leadership behaviors and processes have a greater impact on boards' strategy involvement than structural leadership characteristics alone.</p>
<p>Theoretical/Academic Implications: The study provides empirical support for a team production perspective on boards. Our data show that (1) board members' knowledge, board development, and board chairperson leadership efficacy positively influence boards' strategy involvement, and (2) chairperson leadership efficacy enhances boards' strategy involvement under structural conditions of combined CEO/chairperson leadership and changes in board composition. These findings expand the traditional understanding of structural leadership conditions.</p>
<p>Practitioner/Policy Implications: The study offers insights to small business owners and managers on how to improve the strategy involvement of boards. For policy makers, the study has implications for the content of codes of good governance practice relevant to small firms, specifically in relation to board development initiatives and board evaluations.</p>"

<p>We study testable implications for the dynamics of consumption and income of models in which first-best allocations are not achieved because of a moral hazard problem with hidden saving. We show that in this environment, agents typically achieve more insurance than that obtained under self-insurance with a single asset. Consumption allocations exhibit ""excess smoothness,"" as found and defined by Campbell and Deaton (1989). We argue that excess smoothness, in this context, is equivalent to a violation of the intertemporal budget constraint considered in a Bewley economy (with a single asset). We also show parameterizations of our model in which we can obtain a closed-form solution for the efficient insurance contract and where the excess smoothness parameter has a structural interpretation in terms of the severity of the moral hazard problem. We present tests of excess smoothness, applied to U.K. microdata and constructed using techniques proposed by Hansen, Roberds, and Sargent (1991) to test the intertemporal budget constraint. Our theoretical model leads us to interpret them as tests of the market structure faced by economic agents. We also construct a test based on the dynamics of the cross-sectional variances of consumption and income that is, in a precise sense, complementary to that based on Hansen, Roberds, and Sargent (1991) and that allows us to estimate the same structural parameter. The results we report are consistent with the implications of the model and are internally coherent.</p>"

Results suggest that features which are specific to microfinance-such as tight repayment schedules and land-based eligibility rules-may reduce the suitability of this source of funds for the farming sector.

<p>There is a considerable debate on the effects of environmental regulation on competitive performance. Based on survey data, this paper analyzesthe two main research questions, derived from literature, on the links between environmental regulation and competitiveness, by focusing on firms operating in the building and construction sector, i.e.: 1) whether environmental policy stringency affects the competitive performance of firms in the building and construction sector 2) and how a specific form of environmental regulation (direct regulation, economic instruments and soft instruments) affects this performance? By applying a regression analysis, we find that a more stringent environmental regulation, measured by inspection frequency, provides a positive impulse for increasing investments in advanced technological equipment and innovative products and on business performance. Moreover, a well-designed ""direct regulation"" appears to be the most effective policy instrument for prompting the positive impact of environmental policies on innovation and intangible performance while economic instruments do negatively affect business performance.

<p>As antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV/AIDS is scaled up globally, information on per-person costs is critical to improve efficiency in service delivery and to maximize coverage and health impact. The objective of this study was to review studies on unit costs for delivery of adult and paediatric ART per patient-year, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) interventions per mother-infant pair screened or treated, in low- and middle-income countries. A systematic review was conducted of English, French and Spanish publications from 2001 to 2009, reporting empirical costing that accounted for at least antiretroviral (ARV) medicines, laboratory testing and personnel. Expenditures were analysed by country-income level and cost component. All costs were standardized to $US, year 2009 values. Several sensitivity analyses were conducted.</p>
<p>Analyses covered 29 eligible, comprehensive, costing studies. In the base case, in low-income countries (LIC), median ART cost per patient-year was $US792 (mean: 839, range: 682-1089); for lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), the median was $US932 (mean: 1246, range: 156-3904); and, for upper-middle-income countries (UMIC), the median was $US1454 (mean: 2783, range: 1230-5667). ARV drugs were the largest component of overall ART costs in all settings (64%, 50% and 47% in LIC, LMIC and UMIC, respectively). Of 26 ART studies, 14 reported the drug regimes used, and only one study explicitly reported second-line treatment costs. The second cost driver was laboratory cost in LIC and LMIC (14% and 20%), and personnel costs in UMIC (26%). Two ART studies specified the types of laboratory tests costed, and three studies specifically included above facility-level personnel costs. Three studies reported detailed PMTCT costs, and three studies reported on paediatric ART.</p>
<p>There is a paucity of data on the full unit costs for delivery of ART and PMTCT, particularly for LIC and middle-income countries. Heterogeneity in activities costed, and insufficient detail regarding components included in the costing, hampers standardization of unit cost measures. Evaluation of programme-level unit costs would benefit from international guidance on standardized costing methods, and expenditure categories and definitions. Future work should help elucidate the sources of the large variations in delivery unit costs across settings with similar income and epidemiological characteristics.</p>"

<p>Integrating organization theory, organizational economics, and organizational law considerations, it is argued that the 'nature of the firm' can be more completely understood if it is considered a complete society-establishing contract, including constitutional pacts on procedures for the selection of actions, rather than a nexus of incomplete transactional contracts complemented by authority, power, or relational norms. The explanation is more general since firm-establishing contracts are a sub-set of those society-establishing contracts that are capable of regulating any venture in condition of high uncertainty and potential conflict, and because the constitutional regime adopted (authority-based, democratic, or other) becomes a specification of particular types of firms rather than part of the explanation of the firm. Evidence from published studies, as well as from newly gathered data on firm-founding contracts and other partnership establishing contracts (500 record database on large multi-party projects), document that actual contracts under uncertainty do fit the hypothesized pattern.</p>"

<p>Purpose - Importance-performance analysis (IPA) is a simple marketing tool commonly used to identify the main strengths and weaknesses of a value proposition. The purpose of this paper is to propose a revision of traditional IPA prompted by intuitions arising from the three-factor theory of customer satisfaction. The ultimate goal is to propose a decision support method, which is as simple and intuitive as the original IPA, but more precise and reliable than the solutions proposed thus far.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - In order to estimate indirect measures of attribute importance, the study uses the coefficients of a multiple regression with overall satisfaction ratings as the dependent variable. Additional calculations are then introduced in order to manage non-linear effects.</p>
<p>Findings - Using empirical data from a survey among 5,209 customers of a European bank, the authors show how the proposed method can be more accurate than other solutions, especially as disregarding non-linear effects can prompt sub-optimal marketing decisions.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - While the procedure in this ""study is applicable to any service business, the paper does not claim external validity for the numerical results of the empirical application: the authors acknowledge that only one dataset has been used. The authors' goal is merely to demonstrate a revised approach to IPA.</p>
<p>Originality/value - First, the authors assert the need for an explicit distinction between the use of IPA for customer acquisition vs customer retention purposes. These two cases refer to distinct moments in the customer relationship life cycle and thus require separate analyses. The authors then propose a specific method for customer retention IPA. On this basis, they generate two priority charts: one for the purpose of maximizing customer satisfaction and one for the purpose of minimizing customer dissatisfaction.</p>"

<p>Despite the fact that the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza strain was less severe than had been feared, both seasonal epidemics of influenza-like-illness and future influenza pandemics have the potential to place a serious burden on health services. The closure of schools has been postulated as a means of reducing transmission between children and hence reducing the number of cases at the peak of an epidemic; this is supported by the marked reduction in cases during school holidays observed across the world during the 2009 pandemic. However, a national policy of long-duration school closures could have severe economic costs. Reactive short-duration closure of schools in regions where health services are close to capacity offers a potential compromise, but it is unclear over what spatial scale and time frame closures would need to be made to be effective. Here, using detailed geographical information for England, we assess how localized school closures could alleviate the burden on hospital intensive care units (ICUs) that are reaching capacity. We show that, for a range of epidemiologically plausible assumptions, considerable local coordination of school closures is needed to achieve a substantial reduction in the number of hospitals where capacity is exceeded at the peak of the epidemic. The heterogeneity in demand per hospital ICU bed means that even widespread school closures are unlikely to have an impact on whether demand will exceed capacity for many hospitals. These results support the UK decision not to use localized school closures as a control mechanism, but have far wider international public-health implications. The spatial heterogeneities in both population density and hospital capacity that give rise to our results exist in many developed countries, while our model assumptions are sufficiently general to cover a wide range of pathogens. This leads us to believe that when a pandemic has severe implications for ICU capacity, only widespread school closures (with their associated costs and organizational challenges) are sufficient to mitigate the burden on the worst-affected hospitals.</p>"

<p>The paper addresses the issue of forecasting a large set of variables using multivariate models. In particular, we propose three alternative reduced rank forecasting models and compare their predictive performance for US time series with the most promising existing alternatives, namely, factor models, large-scale Bayesian VARs, and multivariate boosting. Specifically, we focus on classical reduced rank regression, a two-step procedure that applies, in turn, shrinkage and reduced rank restrictions, and the reduced rank Bayesian VAR of Geweke (1996). We find that using shrinkage and rank reduction in combination rather than separately improves substantially the accuracy of forecasts, both when the whole set of variables is to be forecast and for key variables such as industrial production growth, inflation, and the federal funds rate. The robustness of this finding is confirmed by a Monte Carlo experiment based on bootstrapped data. We also provide a consistency result for the reduced rank regression valid when the dimension of the system tends to infinity, which opens the way to using large-scale reduced rank models for empirical analysis.

<p>Structural models of default establish a relation across the fair values of various asset classes (equity, bonds, credit derivatives) referring to the same company. In most circumstances such relation is verified in practice, as different financial assets tend to move in the same direction at similar speed. However, occasional deviations from the theoretical fair values occur, especially in times of financial turmoil. Understanding how the dynamics of the theoretical fair values of various assets compares to that of their market values is crucial to a number of market participants. This paper investigates whether a popular structural model, the CreditGrades approach proposed by Finger (2002), Stamicar and Finger (2005), succeeds in explaining the dynamic relation between equity/option variables and Credit Default Swap (CDS) premia at individual company level. We find that CDS model spreads display a significant correlation with CDS market spreads. However, the gap between the two is time varying and widens substantially in times of financial turbulence. The analysis of the gap dynamics reveals that this is partly due to episodes of decoupling between equity and credit markets, and partly due to shortcomings of the model. Finally, we observe that model spreads tend to predict market spreads.</p>"

<p>The nature of the local health authorities (LHAs) in the Italian National Health Service has been deeply reformed during the 1990s by new public management (NPM) reforms that introduced decentralization, quasi-market and managerialism. These reforms implied that the main role of LHA is to govern the production of health services in their area (steer) rather than to only directly produce services (row). After more than 15 years from these reforms of Italian healthcare. we describe how much the steering versus rowing dichotomy made an impact on LHA activity. through an analysis of the management control systems they set up for themselves and the subsequent qualitative analysis of the opinions that a diverse group of managers expressed during 8 days of group discussion. Results show that managers of Italian LHAs, when only a small part of services is produced, tend to perceive their steering role as impossible to play and focus on production. leaving therefore ungoverned a significant part of the services offered to residents. NPM. therefore. was able to influence the reform of Italian healthcare but, as suggested by a postmodernist interpretation, left managers with a rhetoric change based on inconsistent assumptions instead of actionable ideas to manage the change process.

<p>The relationship between conflict and education has been studied before. However, previous authors have always focused strongly on the supply-side effects, whereas this article examines the influence of conflict on the demand for education. It is theoretically shown that, under relatively general conditions, individuals living in a conflict area have an incentive to increase their level of education and that this effect depends on the individual's skill level. This hypothesis is tested using the conflict in the Basque Region as a case study, which is an example of a conflict in which one would not expect strong supply-side effects. Using other Spanish regions, an artificial region is created in which the population has a similar educational distribution as in the Basque Region. When comparing the true and artificial regions, individuals with a medium education level clearly show an increase in education during the conflict, as predicted by the theoretical model.</p>"

We characterize conditions under which multiple equilibria in stress levels and growth rates exist; and under which the dynamics exhibit hysteresis. High rates of innovation can result in high stress equilibrium and have a negative effect on economic growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>In this work, we consider three problems of the standard market approach to credit index options pricing: the definition of the index spread is not valid in general, the considered payoff leads to a pricing which is not always defined, and the candidate numeraire for defining a pricing measure is not strictly positive, which leads to a nonequivalent pricing measure. We give a solution to the three problems, based on modeling the flow of information through a suitable subfiltration. With this we consistently take into account the possibility of default of all names in the portfolio, that is neglected in the standard market approach. We show on market inputs that, while the pricing difference can be negligible in normal market conditions, it can become highly relevant in stressed market conditions, like the situation caused by the credit crunch.</p>"

<p>When there is uncertainty about interest rates (typically due to either illiquidity or defaultability of zero coupon bonds) the cash-additivity assumption on risk measures becomes problematic. When this assumption is weakened, to cash-subadditivity for example, the equivalence between convexity and the diversification principle no longer holds. In fact, this principle only implies (and it is implied by) quasiconvexity. For this reason, in this paper quasiconvex risk measures are studied. We provide a dual characterization of quasiconvex cash-subadditive risk measures and we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for their law invariance.

<p>We implement the commands mstat and mtest to perform inference based on the M statistic, a statistic that can be used to compare the interpoint distance distribution across groups of observations.</p>
<p>The analyses are based on the study of the interpoint distances between n points in a k-dimensional setting to produce a one-dimensional real-valued test statistic. The locations are distributed in a region of the plane. When we consider all (72) interpoint distances, the dependencies among them are difficult to express analytically, but their distribution is informative, and the M statistic can be built to summarize one aspect of this information.</p>
<p>The two commands can be used on a wide class of datasets to test the null hypothesis that two groups have the same (spatial) distribution. mstat and mtest return the exact M test statistic. Moreover, mtest executes a Monte Carlo type permutation test, which returns the empirical p-value together with its confidence interval. This is the command to use in most situations, because the convergence of M to its asymptotic chi-squared distribution is slow.</p>
<p>Both commands can be used to obtain graphical output of the empirical density function of the interpoint distance distributions in the two groups and the two-dimensional map of the 71 observations in the plane.</p>

We run the test on the Alt and Vach grave site dataset (Manjourides and Pagano, forthcoming, Statistics in Medicine) and reject the null hypothesis, in contradiction to other published analyses. We also show how to adapt the techniques to discrete datasets with more than one unit in each location. Finally, we report an extensive application on breast cancer data in Massachusetts; in the application, we show the compatibility of the M commands with Pisati's spmap package.</p>"

The present study compares alternative waste management scenarios through the development of a desktop model that tries to remove the above assumption. Several alternative scenarios based on different combinations of energy and materials recovery are applied to two imaginary areas modelled in order to represent a typical Northern Italian setting. External costs and benefits implied by scenarios are also considered. Scenarios are compared on the base of the full cost for treating the total waste generated in the area.

<p>Purpose - Urban areas are responsible for significant amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but cities can have quite different values of carbon footprints. The purpose of this paper is to identify the determinants of urban GHG emissions in order to explain these differences.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - Seven global cities - Bangkok, Chicago, London, Madrid, Mexico City, Milan and New York City - have been included in the paper's sample. These cases have been chosen in order to represent a variety of characteristics and contexts of developed and developing countries and according to data availability. A first level of analysis regards local GHG emission inventories, which attribute emissions to activity sectors. Sectorial emissions are then evaluated to quantify the relevance of several determinants: climate conditions, urban form, economic activities in place, state of technology, mobility and housing infrastructures and costs, and income and life style.</p>
<p>Findings - Determinants show different weights in influencing behaviours at city level, and ultimately depend on economic, technical, social and cultural factors. Beside a significant role of climate conditions, urban density appears as the main determinant in shaping residential emissions from direct fuel consumption, whereas, for electricity, consumption patterns and technological features of power generation play a major role. For ground transport, urban form affecting mobility patterns and technological features of the vehicle stock stand out as the most significant determinants.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The paper provides a deep insight into urban GHG emission values, making use of a comprehensive set of urban data and highlighting several areas which could possibly be targeted in cities' GHG reduction policies.

<p>A number of companies allocate ownership rights to stakeholders different from shareholders, despite the fact that the law attributes these rights to the equity holders. This article contributes to an understanding of this evidence by developing a contingency model for the allocation of ownership rights. The model sheds light on why companies, despite pressures from the law, vary in their allocation of ownership rights. The model is based on the assumption that corporations increase their chance to survive and prosper if the stakeholders supplying ""critical contributions"" receive the ownership rights. According to the model, ""critical"" contributions involve (1) contractual problems due to specific investments, long-term relationships, and low measurability; (2) the assumption of the uncertainty resting on the company; and (3) the supply of scarce and valuable resources. The model is dynamic because it also provides a basis for understanding why the allocation of ownership rights changes with time.

<p>Background: To estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of a project administering de-worming and weekly iron-folic acid supplementation to control anaemia in women of reproductive age in Yen Bai province, Vietnam.</p>
<p>Methods and Findings: Cost effectiveness was evaluated using data on programmatic costs based on two surveys in 2006 and 2009 and impact on anaemia and iron status collected in 2006, 2007, and 2008. Data on initial costs for training and educational materials were obtained from the records of the National Institute of Malariology, Parasitology and Entomology and the Yen Bai Malaria Control Program. Structured questionnaires for health workers at district, commune and village level were used to collect ongoing distribution and monitoring costs, and for participants to collect transport and loss of earnings costs. The cost per woman treated (defined as consuming at least 75% of the recommended intake) was USD0.76 per annum. This estimate includes financial costs (for supplies, training), and costs of health care workers' time. Prevalence of anaemia fell from 38% at baseline, to 20% after 12 months. Thus, the cost-effectiveness of the project is assessed at USD 4.24 per anaemia case prevented per year. Based on estimated productivity gains for adult women, the benefit: cost ratio is 6.7:1. Cost of the supplements and anthelminthics was 47% of the total, while costs of training, monitoring, and health workers' time accounted for 53%.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The study shows that weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and regular de-worming is a low-cost and cost-effective intervention and would be appropriate for population-based introduction in settings with a high prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency and low malaria infection rates.</p>"

<p>This research explores how social cues presented in an online auction affect sniping behavior. Sniping is a strategy of placing a bid on an item in the very ending stages of an auction with a pre-determined ending time in an attempt to win the auction. Such a strategy conceals the intentions of the bidder until the last moments of the auction and minimizes the possibility of other opposing bidders submitting higher bids due to the short period of time left to respond. The research includes two field studies and a lab experiment indicating that sniping appears to be influenced by social factors, that is, when there are a greater number of bidders in the auction or the auction site provides social information about the bidders, the relative use of sniping increases.

<p>Trade shows and other temporary clusters have recently emerged as key sites of theoretical relevance for scholars who are interested in the spatial consequences of interactive learning. Recent research has viewed these events as relational spaces in which countless actors interact and learn spontaneously without a central actor governing the process. In the case of permanent clusters, however, studies have started to unpack the practices through which key actors, such as entrepreneurial and professional associations, stimulate learning and interaction. In this article, we hold that these central subjects also have an important role in activating the benefits of colocalization with regard to temporary clusters. In an empirical study of the European Union clothing fabric trade shows between 1986 and 2006, we identified four types of practices through which trade show organizers shape learning and interaction at their events. Contrary to current views, our study found that exchanges of knowledge at these events do not always occur at the global level. Instead, the geographic scale of the processes of exchanging and acquiring knowledge in temporary clusters is socially and politically constructed at several levels-from the merely local to the truly global. We also found that organizers of trade shows facilitate vertical relationships between exhibitors and typical visitors (i.e., buyers), whereas other knowledge flows are neglected or even hindered. We conclude this article by highlighting the theoretical implications of our study for the literature on the spatial consequences of interaction and innovation.</p>"

In the search for explanations for the trajectory of administrative reform, pre-existing political and institutional factors also have to be interpreted through the lens of negotiated change occurring via processes of conversion and layering involving new and old institutions that has taken place in Italy since the 'political crisis' began in 1992.</p>"

<p>There is ongoing debate on the wealth-generating possibilities of heritage. In resource-based view theory, heritage is a key resource for a destination striving for sustainable positioning. The difficulty in transforming heritage from an asset to a resource often derives from lack of convergence between institutions responsible for heritage preservation and those responsible for tourism. The literature suggests that this relationship is not necessarily conflictual and correlates cooperation with heritage characteristics and a history of tourism. Based on their analysis of 10 Italian destinations, the authors challenge this hypothesis and suggest that, independently of the wealth of heritage resources and the tourism maturity of destinations, effective coordination is based on a three-phase process. Such coordination addresses managerial paradoxes that are intrinsic to the joint pursuit of heritage preservation and tourism development.</p>"

<p>We examine a variety of preference-based definitions of ambiguous events in the context of the smooth ambiguity model. We first consider the definition proposed in Klibanoff et al.

Within the smooth ambiguity model, we show that Ghirardato and Marinacci (J Econ Theory 102:251-289, 2002) would identify the same set of ambiguous and unambiguous events as our definition while Epstein and Zhang (Econometrica 69:265-306, 2001) and Zhang (Econ Theory 20:159-181, 2002) would yield a different classification. Moreover, we discuss and formally identify two key sources of the differences compared to Epstein and Zhang (Econometrica 69:265-306, 2001) and Zhang (Econ Theory 20:159-181, 2002). The more interesting source is that these two definitions can confound non-constant ambiguity attitude and the ambiguity of an event.</p>"

Using data from the ITAGEN2 follow-up, we analyze scholastic results from the middle school final exam and the choice of secondary school among the adolescents in Italy. Children of immigrants are more likely to have inferior outcomes on the middle school exam and to enroll in vocational and polytechnic schools. Our multivariate results indicate that, after controlling for the family's human capital and other key background factors, immigrant students show greater propensity to choose a vocational path. Differences between immigrants and natives in secondary school tracks are also manifested when previous scholastic results are taken into account.</p>"

Sophistication is defined as the use of non-basic financial products such as options, swaps, debt restructuring, and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) advisory services. Our analysis is based on a unique dataset with detailed information on 187 Italian family firms. We find that the main drivers of financial sophistication are: (1) the generation that currently owns the firm; (2) the presence of a non-family CFO; and (3) the existence of a non-family shareholder. We analyze the impact of these factors on the following four classes of non-basic financial products: corporate finance, cash management, corporate lending and risk management. Our results can be used to determine the characteristics of financially sophisticated family firms and whether their corporate governance and ownership structure increase the use of non-basic financial products.

The results show that, together with a lack of meaningful referents, the inability to make links between these referents constitutes a major barrier to immersion. The authors highlight the need for curators to manage referents in the framework of an exhibition and establish the complementary role that a guide might play, especially for people belonging to different generations.</p>"

<p>In the context of the proposed EU financial supervisory reforms, this paper focuses on the governance of the network of national supervisory banking agencies and the newly established Community supervisor (European Banking Authority, EBA). We assess to what extent lack of governance convergence nationally and with EBA could undermine the incentives for cooperation among supervisors. Convergence should particularly focus on (i) the issue of the presence of politicians on decision-making bodies; (ii) the need for clearly defining dismissal procedures of heads of supervision; (iii) autonomy from government in regulatory matters; (iv) supervisory autonomy in matters of licensing and withdrawing licenses; (iv) mechanisms for judicial accountability; (v) legal protection for supervisors handling in good faith. In the absence of full centralization of prudential supervision, early harmonization of national governance arrangements towards best practice would better align supervisors' incentive structures and, hence, be beneficial for the effectiveness of European supervision.

<p>This paper investigates whether securities class actions (SCAs) can play a role in banking supervision, both as a warning signal of insolvency and as an instrument of market discipline to encourage bank managers to carefully evaluate risk. Two groups of US banks are compared over the 2000-2008 period. One includes banks that have faced at least one SCA, while the other is composed of non-targeted banks (control group). Results indicate that collective private litigation procedures are more frequently directed at financially fragile intermediaries exhibiting inadequate governance standards. Furthermore, banks which have been subjected to SCAs are likely to reduce their excessive risk positions. This supports the idea that SCAs could be efficiently employed as a complement to public supervisory activity in the banking sector. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>The Mediterranean and neighboring countries are already experiencing a broad range of natural and man-made threats to water security. According to climate projections, the region is at risk due to its pronounced susceptibility to changes in the hydrological budget and extremes. Such changes are expected to have strong impacts on the management of water resources and on key strategic sectors of regional economies. Related developments have an increased capacity to exacerbate tensions, and even intra- and inter-state conflict among social, political, ecological and economic actors. Thus, effective adaptation and prevention policy measures call for multi-disciplinary analysis and action.</p>

<p>In spite of the frequent calls for a much more integrated approach, the field of management still faces the ever continuing challenges in attempting to bridge the gap between academic research and managerial actions and practices. The field of strategic alliances and firms' networks are those among which research and practice are more diverging. Trying to cover this separation, the article presents an empirical research on automotive industry that investigates the effects on innovation performance of the position that firms occupy in the network of alliances. The hypothesis that guides this research is that innovation is generated not only from the resources that a company is able to develop internally, but also through access to resources and capabilities owned by the external companies and organizations that the firm itself is tied to through alliances and cooperation agreements. Beyond this broad argument, the paper links tightly research and practice showing way and how the quality of access to resources owned by partners is influenced by the position occupied in the network of alliances and not only by the existence of single collaborative ties. Assuming a managerial approach which relies on the milestones of network research, different types of positioning in the network of alliances are discussed and tested on their impact on innovation.

<p>Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the emerging crowd-funding phenomenon, that is a collective effort by consumers who network and pool their money together, usually via the internet, in order to invest in and support efforts initiated by other people or organizations. Successful service businesses that organize crowd-funding and act as intermediaries are emerging, attesting to the viability of this means of attracting investment.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - The research employs a ""grounded theory"" approach, performing an in-depth qualitative analysis of three cases involving crowd-funding initiatives: SellaBand in the music business, Trampoline in financial services, and Kapipal in non-profit services. These cases were selected to represent a diverse set of crowd-funding operations that vary in terms of risk/return for the investor and the type of payoff associated to the investment.</p>
<p>Findings - The research addresses two research questions: how and why do consumers turn into crowd-funding participants? and how and why do service providers set up a crowd-funding initiative? Concerning the first research question, the authors' findings reveal purposes, characteristics, roles and tasks, and investment size of crowd-funding activity from the consumer's point of view. Regarding the second research question, the authors' analysis reveals purposes, service roles, and network effects of crowd-funding activity investigated from the point of view of the service organization that set up the initiative.</p>
<p>Practical implications - The findings also have implications for service managers interested in launching and/or managing crowd-funding initiatives.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The paper addresses an emerging phenomenon and contributes to service theory in terms of extending the consumer's role from co-production and co-creation to investment.</p>"

<p>Background: The UK introduced the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) into the national vaccination program in September 2006. Previous modelling assumed that the likely impact of PCV7 on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) would be similar to the US experience with PCV7. However, recent surveillance data show a more rapid replacement of PCV7 IPD cases by non-PCV7 IPD cases than was seen in the US.</p>
<p>Methods and Findings: A previous model of pneumococcal vaccination was re-parameterised using data on vaccine coverage and IPD from England and Wales between 2006 and 2009. Disease incidence was adjusted for the increasing trend in reported IPD cases prior to vaccination. Using this data we estimated that individuals carrying PCV7 serotypes have much higher protection (96%; 95% CI 72%-100%) against acquisition of NVT carriage than the 15% previously estimated from US data, which leads to greater replacement. However, even with this level of replacement, the annual number of IPD cases may be 560 (95% CI, -100 to 1230) lower ten years after vaccine introduction compared to what it may have been without vaccination. A particularly marked fall of 39% in children under 15 years by 2015/6 is predicted.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Our model suggests that PCV7 vaccination could result in a decrease in overall invasive pneumococcal disease, particularly in children, even in an environment of rapid replacement with non-PCV7 serotypes within 5 years of vaccine introduction at high coverage.</p>"

<p>We study the robustness of interim correlated rationalizability to perturbations of higher-order beliefs. We introduce a new metric topology on the universal type space, called uniform-weak topology, under which two types are close if they have similar first-order beliefs, attach similar probabilities to other players having similar first-order beliefs, and so on, where the degree of similarity is uniform over the levels of the belief hierarchy. This topology generalizes the now classic notion of proximity to common knowledge based on common p-beliefs (Monderer and Samet 1989). We show that convergence in the uniform-weak topology implies convergence in the uniform-strategic topology (Dekel et al. 2006). Moreover, when the limit is a finite type, uniform-weak convergence is also a necessary condition for convergence in the strategic topology. Finally, we show that the set of finite types is nowhere dense under the uniform strategic topology. Thus, our results shed light on the connection between similarity of beliefs and similarity of behaviors in games.</p>"

<p>I consider the application of Article 82 using an economic approach. I argue that proving a given practice anticompetitive or efficient can be usefully framed as an identification problem. I need to spell out in detail not only the anticompetitive story, related to the type of alleged anticompetitive strategy, but also the alternative competitive explanation, extracting the empirical predictions of the two. Comparing the latter, I can identify the factual elements that, occurring under both circumstances, are admissible under both of them, and those that instead, being specific to one of the stories, allow for discriminating between them. I apply this approach to a recent Italian case [Mercato del Calcestruzzo Cellulare Autoclavato, No. A372 (Autorita Garante della Concorrenza a del Mercato, 24 October 2007)] of selective price cuts, an example of predation where the dominant firm tries to eliminate a competitor by selectively offering discounts to the clients of the target. On the basis of a rich empirical analysis, the Authority condemned RDB, a medium-sized firm active in the market for construction materials. I show that, once the two stories are properly described, the evidence provided in the decision of the Antitrust Authority is consistent with a competitive strategy of decentralized price negotiation, whereas it is in sharp contrast with the empirical predictions derived from a predatory model of selective price cuts.</p>"

<p>The Italian National Health Service (INHS) has undergone profound changes over the past three decades. With establishment of the INHS in 1978-a tax-based public health care system with universal coverage-one of the underlying principles was integration. The recognition of health and health care as requiring integrated answers led to the creation of a single public organization, the Local Health Unit, responsible for the health status of the population of its catchment area. At the beginning of the 1990s, the scenario radically changed. The creation of hospital trusts, the development of quasi-market mechanisms and management control tools, the adoption of a prospective payment system for reimbursing health care providers-all were signs of deintegration and institutional unbundling. Two structural changes have deeply sustained this deintegration: patients' empowerment and the increased possibilities for outsourcing practices. In more recent years, a new reintegration effort has occurred, often led by regional governments and based on institutional cooperation and network relationships. However, the earlier structural changes require innovative approaches and solutions if public health care organizations want to retain their leading role.</p>"

<p>The Great Recession triggered a resurgence of short-time work (STW) throughout the OECD. Several countries introduced STW from scratch or significantly expanded the scope of the programmes already in place. In some countries like Italy, Japan and Germany between 2.5% and 5% of the workforce participated in STW schemes at the trough of the recession. In this paper we analyse the rationale for STW benefits and their effects on labour adjustment from both a cross-country and a time-series perspective. We find that STW actually contributed to reduce job losses during the Great Recession. However, the number of jobs saved, according to our macroeconomic and microeconomic estimates, is smaller than the number of participants in these schemes and the full-time equivalent jobs involved, pointing in some countries to sizeable deadweight costs. Other institutions, like plant-level bargaining over hours, wages and employment levels, may be more effective than STW in encouraging adjustment along the intensive margins in the presence of temporary shocks. Our results also suggest that STW cannot be readily extended to countries having much different institutional configurations as the demand for STW is very much affected by other institutions such as employment protection legislation and the degree of centralization of collective bargaining. Furthermore, STW must be temporary as during upturns may actually negatively affect employment. We also find that specific design features of STW - such as experience-rating and disincentives to 100% reductions in working hours - are important in improving the cyclical properties of STW.</p>"

<p>This article presents a model of the research and publication process that analyzes why scientists commit fraud and how fraud can be detected and prevented. In the model, authors are asymmetrically informed about the success of their projects and can fraudulently manipulate their results. We show, first, that the types of scientific frauds that are observed are unlikely to be representative of the overall amount of malfeasance; also, star scientists are more likely to misbehave but less likely to be caught than average scientists. Second, a reduction in fraud verification costs may not lead to a reduction of misconduct episodes but rather to a change in the type of research that is performed. Third, a strong ""publish or perish"" pressure may reduce, and not increase, scientific misconduct because it motivates more scrutiny. Finally, a more active role of editors in checking for misconduct does not always provide additional deterrence.</p>"

<p>The effect of financial resource constraints on innovation team performance is ambiguous. On the one hand, the majority of scholars have argued that financial resource constraints have an inhibiting effect on innovation, whereas budgetary slack supports creativity and innovation. Consistent with this notion, in most conceptual models on the management of innovation projects, the availability of slack, or at least adequate (rather than constrained) resources represents an important success factor supporting innovation. On the other hand, popular parlance has it that sometimes ""necessity is the mother of innovation,"" and literature in cognitive psychology suggests that resource constraints stimulate creativity and innovative behavior. Recent innovation literature indeed provides evidence that remarkable innovation outcomes can be achieved with constrained financial resources. Despite the rapidly growing research on success factors of innovation projects, and the high managerial relevance of budget questions, the influence of financial resource constraints has only very recently started to attract interest. The objective of the present study is to contribute to that research by investigating under what conditions financial resource constraints lead to innovation outcomes. Specifically, team climate for innovation is examined as a potentially important contingency variable of the relationship between financial resource constraints and innovation project performance. By explicitly focusing on team climate for innovation, factors of the work environment in innovation projects are addressed as influential boundary conditions for successfully innovating under financial resource constraints. The hypotheses are tested on a sample of 94 innovation project teams from a variety of industries. To ensure content validity and to avoid a possible common source bias, data from different respondents, i.e., team leaders, team members, and team external managers of the innovation projects, are used. Results of regression analyses show that there is no significant relationship between financial resource constraints and innovation project outcomes in terms of product quality and project efficiency. However, results show a significant interaction term of financial resource constraints and team climate for innovation in that team climate for innovation positively moderates the relationship between financial resource constraints and product quality as well as project efficiency. Thus, the findings of the present study contradict the widespread notion in innovation literature that financial resource constraints have a wholesale inhibiting effect on innovation, thereby providing a differentiated perspective on the relationship between financial resource constraints and innovation. On a practical level, the results of this study highlight a specific condition under which product developers can come up with more innovative solutions despite, or even because of, financial "

<p>Manuscript Type: Empirical</p>
<p>Research Question/Issue: This paper focuses on the relationship between one of the main corporate governance dimensions - ownership structure - and income smoothing. The paper investigates whether family-controlled companies differ from non-family-controlled companies with respect to income smoothing. Due to different incentives of management and owner investment horizons, we hypothesize that income smoothing is less likely among family-controlled companies than among non-family-controlled companies. Additionally, we hypothesize that among family-controlled firms income smoothing is less likely when CEO and Board Chairman are members of the controlling family. Various definitions of ""family control"" are applied. A sample of Italian listed companies is used for the empirical analysis.</p>
<p>Research Findings/Insights: We find evidence that income smoothing is less likely among family-controlled companies than non-family-controlled companies. Moreover, among family-controlled companies, income smoothing is less likely for firms whose CEO and Board Chairman are members of the controlling family.</p>
<p>Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper fills a gap in the literature, suggesting that not only the level of ownership concentration or insider ownership but also the nature of the dominant shareholder (family versus non-family) should be considered when addressing the motivations for income smoothing. Furthermore, our findings indicate that agency theory and stewardship theory are complementary in explaining the role played by family control in income smoothing decisions. While in non-family-controlled companies the traditional owner-manager agency problems tend to prevail and motivate income smoothing, in family-controlled companies such agency issues become less relevant and a stewardship attitude emerges, rendering income smoothing less likely.</p>
<p>Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study is of interest to financial statement users, including analysts and investors, as it shows that different company types (e. g., family versus non-family) have a different attitude towards income smoothing. In particular, these results aid users in interpreting the company's reported profitability and its potential variability. The conclusions also are of interest to auditors when evaluating the reliability of the reported income of companies characterized by various ownership structures.</p>"

<p>Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the links between strategy implementation, performance measurement and strategic alignment within a highly diversified group of firms.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - A mix of qualitative and quantitative approaches was used, and data were gathered in two different periods. In the first phase, preliminary interviews were followed by a survey across all the firms of the group and by semi-structured interviews in four companies. Semi-structured interviews were conducted four years later to explore changes in both strategy and performance measurement systems (PMSs).</p>
<p>Findings - This research contributes to the debate on the appropriateness of introducing PMSs as formal management control mechanisms. The analysis of data led to three main findings. First, the introduction of IT systems and specific governance mechanisms alone enabled the implementation of strategy across the group only to a limited extent. Second, the lack of a comprehensive PMS appeared to have negative effects on both the formulation and implementation of strategy. Third, following a phase of substantial expansion, both strategy and measurement systems had to be changed to provide a greater sense of direction and to gather data on non-financial aspects of the business.</p>
<p>Originality/value - This research considers the case of a group of firms, which aimed to achieve strategy implementation and alignment without introducing a comprehensive PMS. This paper provides empirical evidence of the potential limitations of such an approach, and illustrates the changes to strategy and performance measurement made by the company considered.</p>"

<p>Background: In Gabon, the impact of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in infants (IPTi) was not statistically significant on malaria reduction, but the impact on moderate anaemia was, with some differences between the intention to treat (ITT) and the according to protocol (ATP) trial analyses. Specifically, ATP was statistically significant, while ITT analysis was borderline. The main reason for the difference between ITT and ATP populations was migration.</p>
<p>Methods: This study estimates the cost-effectiveness of IPTi on the reduction of anaemia in Gabon, comparing results of the ITT and the ATP clinical trial analyses. Threshold analysis was conducted to identify when the intervention costs and protective efficacy of IPTi for the ATP cohort equalled the ITT cost-effectiveness ratio.</p>
<p>Results: Based on IPTi intervention costs, the cost per episode of moderate anaemia averted was US$12.88 (CI 95% 4.19, 30.48) using the ITT analysis and US$11.30 (CI 95% 4.56, 26.66) using the ATP analysis. In order for the ATP results to equal the cost-effectiveness of ITT, total ATP intervention costs should rise from 118.38 to 134 US$ ATP or the protective efficacy should fall from 27% to 18.1%. The uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness ratio using ITT trial results was higher than using ATP results.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Migration implies great challenges in the organization of health interventions that require repeat visits in Gabon. This was apparent in the study as the cost-effectiveness of IPTp-SP worsened when drop out from the prevention was taken into account. Despite such challenges, IPTi was both inexpensive and efficacious in averting cases of moderate anaemia in infants.</p>"

<p>Purpose - Tourism systems have been considered more and more in the light of complexity and chaos theories. Most of the work done in this area has highlighted the reasons for and the issues regarding this approach. A steadily growing strand of the recent literature uses the theories to overcome the problems of a reductionist and mechanistic view that is considered unable to provide a full understanding of the structural and dynamic characteristics of tourism systems, and specifically of tourism destinations. This paper seeks to continue this approach and to provide a series of quantitative methods to assess the dynamics of non-linear complex tourism systems.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - The time series used in the paper contains data collected from a sample of 23 large (four-star) hotels located in Milan, Italy. For each structure daily data of occupancy, average room rate and RevPAR (revenue per available room) were recorded for the period 2006-2009. The daily distributions of these observations are highly skewed, and therefore the median of the daily values were considered. This results in three series of 1,461 points per type (occupancy, room rate and RevPAR).</p>
<p>Findings - The data confirm the complex nature of the destination system and its tendency towards a chaotic state. Additionally, high stability and long memory effects are detected. The outcomes and the implications of this analysis are examined.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - A comparison of the values obtained leads to the conclusion that the series under study has a detectable level of non-linearity, even if it does not reach the pure chaoticity of the Lorenz attractor. A first conclusion is that, as qualitatively assessed in many similar studies, the tourism destination is a complex system with a tendency to become chaotic.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The picture obtained with the analyses conducted can be summarised by saying that the system under study exhibits an unequivocally complex nature. It tends towards a chaotic stage but does so at a slow pace. The stability of the system is quite high: it might be able to resist transient shocks well but, once led in one direction, its long memory characteristics tend to keep it on the resulting path.</p>"

The analysis shows that, even if the theoretical conditions for using the Net Present Value or the IRR as valuation criteria apply, the sensitivity analysis results for the two indicators may differ.

<p>Previous research on capital investment has identified a tendency in multibusiness firms toward cross-subsidization from well-performing to poorly performing divisions, a phenomenon that has previously been attributed to principal-agent conflicts between headquarters and divisions (Stein, 2003). In this paper, we argue that cross-subsidization reflects a more general tendency toward even allocation over all divisions in multibusiness firms that is driven, at least in part, by the cognitive tendency to naively diversify when making investment decisions (Benartzi and Thaler, 2001). We observe that this tendency also leads to partition dependence in which capital allocations vary systematically with the divisions and subdivisions into which the firm is organized or over which capital is allocated. Our first study uses archival data to show that firms' internal capital allocations are biased toward equality over the number of business units into which the firm is partitioned. Two further experimental studies of experienced managers examine whether this bias persists when participants are asked to allocate capital to various divisions of a hypothetical firm. This methodology eliminates the possibility of agency conflicts. Nevertheless, allocations varied systematically with the divisional and subdivisional structure of the firm and with a centralized or decentralized capital allocation manner.

Next, we conduct a content analysis of 51 empirical articles.

Based on this review, we lay out a number of promising directions for future research.

<p>Purpose: Mainstream research indicates that close, long-term ties with business customers have beneficial effects; however, an alternative stream advances the possibility of a ""dark side"" of close relations, especially when the original conditions of the relationships change. This empirical study investigates how established buyer-seller relationships respond to significant changes in their exchange context by considering the value of close ties in the presence of an e-commerce strategy, which generally represents a radical shift.</p>
<p>Methodology/approach: The article explores both the direct effects of close, long-term ties on e-commerce success and the moderating effects of two key contingency factors (partners' readiness and cooperative norms). Independent variables are primary data collected from an extensive survey of 168 e-commerce adopters. Dependent variables are secondary data performance measures. The empirical model is tested using seemingly unrelated regression and non-monotone moderation analysis.</p>
<p>Findings: The study reveals that the mere presence of strong, long-term customer relationships cannot guarantee performance improvements or enhance e-commerce potential. Instead, the two contingency factors modify the role of established relationships, making them as either points of strength or weakness in presence of a change. Strong non-monotone moderation effects are at work.</p>
<p>Research implications: The authors offer an explanation for the contrasting evidence regarding the value of long-term ties, exploring and understanding how to cope with the benefits of stability and the requirements of dynamicity in vertical relations. The findings also contribute to literature on the relational drivers of exchange performance, by citing elements, such as readiness to change and cooperative norms, that can make an existing relationship either an asset or a liability.</p>"

We perform a controlled experiment asking a random subsample of individuals to read a descriptive note on the Italian pension system before answering the questionnaire, finding that citizens reading the note are more willing to support pension reforms.</p>"

<p>This paper investigates the governance design problem of a large company that wants to engage a small and cashless firm into a research collaboration. This analysis reflects the frequently observed collaborations between pharma companies and biotechs, and an actual research contract is assessed to link theory to practice. The governance form refers to the allocation of control rights over the research process and property rights over research output(s), as determined by the initial contract; yet this contract is incomplete. The parties negotiate at a later stage from bargaining positions that depend on the initial choice of the governance, but they also contemplate the possibility that the collaboration will be terminated. By means of a simple model that captures the core aspects of the contractual environment, I answer a key research question: How should governance be designed in the shadow of potential termination to provide the research firm with the incentives to invest in the collaboration? First, it is in the company's interest to choose a governance form that eliminates the possibility of termination and stabilizes the collaboration whenever possible. Second, if the collaboration cannot be stabilized, the company faces a trade-off between reducing the probability of termination and providing incentives, which is ultimately resolved by making the collaboration highly unstable. Third, property rights and control are substitutes in the governance design: If the company collects more property rights, it must relinquish more control rights. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

<p>The precision parameter alpha plays an important role in the Dirichlet Process. When assigning a Dirichlet Process prior to the set of probability measures on R(k), k > 1, this can be restrictive in the sense that the variability is determined by a single parameter. The aim of this paper is to construct an enrichment of the Dirichlet Process that is more flexible with respect to the precision parameter yet still conjugate, starting from the notion of enriched conjugate priors,which have been proposed to address an analogous lack of flexibility of standard conjugate priors in a parametric setting. The resulting enriched conjugate prior allows more flexibility in modelling uncertainty on the marginal and conditionals. We describe an enriched urn scheme which characterizes this process and show that it can also be obtained from the stick-breaking representation of the marginal and conditionals. For non atomic base measures, this allows global clustering of the marginal variables and local clustering of the conditional variables. Finally, we consider an application to mixture models that allows for uncertainty between homoskedasticity and heteroskedasticity.</p>"

<p>Does it matter, for the size of the government spending multiplier, which category of agents bears the brunt of the necessary adjustment in taxes? In an economy with heterogeneous agents and imperfect financial markets, the answer depends on whether or not New Keynesian features, such are price rigidity, are present. If prices are flexible, the tax-financing rule is either neutral or leads to a larger multiplier when taxes are levied on the borrowing constrained agents. If prices are sticky, the multiplier is larger when taxes are levied on the unconstrained agents. We discuss the conditions under which these results hold.

<p>This paper argues that the richer frequency and variety of fiscal policy shocks available in an international sample, which makes the use of this evidence attractive, should be analyzed recognizing the heterogeneity that exists across different countries. The main conclusion of the authors' empirical analysis is that the question ""what is the fiscal policy multiplier"" is an ill-posed one. There is no unconditional fiscal policy multiplier. The effect of fiscal policy on output is different depending on the different debt dynamics, the different degree of openness, and the different fiscal reaction functions across different countries. Such differences concern not only the size of the multiplier, but sometimes also its sign. There are many fiscal multipliers and an average fiscal multiplier is of very little use to describe the effect of exogenous shifts in fiscal policy on output.</p>"

<p>Speculators are active in large markets for emission permits such as those developing under the Kyoto Protocol. Since speculators help risk-averse firms hedging the risk stemming from uncertain future demand, their entry reduces permits' expected returns and volatility. We characterize the optimal environmental policy by the agency setting the total amount of permits when speculators are active. Whenever the agency is sufficiently risk-tolerant, speculators improve aggregate welfare by fostering firms' production. On the other hand, under a moderately risk-averse agency, the increase in production volatility induced by speculators negatively affects social welfare.</p>"

<p>Background: The growing burden of chronic diseases encourages health care systems to shift services and resources toward primary care. In this sector, general practitioners (GPs) play a key role, and several collaborative organizational models have been implemented in the attempt to improve the clinical effectiveness of GPs, their adherence to evidence-based guidelines, and their capacity to work in multiprofessional teams. However, evidence of the impact of different organizational models is sparse, and little is known about the contribution of these models to the good management of chronic diseases.</p>
<p>Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of individual sociodemographic characteristics of GPs and collaborative organizational models with the adherence of physicians to evidence-based guidelines for four major chronic diseases (diabetes, heart failure, stroke, and post-acute myocardial infarction).</p>
<p>Methodology: Evidence-based indicators for the management of the selected chronic diseases were identified on the basis of the most recent international guidelines. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to identify the correlates of adherence to guidelines, taking into account patient characteristics and comorbidities.</p>
<p>Findings: Participation in group practice was associated with different indicators of adherence to guidelines for the management of diabetes and one indicator of post-acute myocardial infarction, whereas other organizational arrangements were linked to GPs' clinical behavior to a lesser degree. Female gender and younger age of GPs were associated with good management of diabetes.</p>
<p>Practice Implications: The relative impact of efforts at organizational design in primary care should be evaluated in more detail before further investments are made in this direction. Our findings suggest that the professional attitude of GPs (of which gender and age can be considered proxies) is equally, if not more, important than their organizational arrangement. Hence, attention should be paid to how organizations and managerial tools can support the consolidation and spread of this attitude.</p>"

<p>This paper examines how motivation, crowding and social image affect environmental conservation decisions. An artefactual field experiment conducted in Bolivia is used to reproduce the trade-off between individual and social benefits in natural resource use and test the effect of non-monetary and non-regulatory incentives on pro-social behavior for environmental conservation. The results show the presence of a social norm prescribing positive contribution towards environmental protection, and that external incentives have heterogeneous effects on pro-social behavior depending on how they influence reputation and self-image. The experimental results differ from those of analogous experiments conducted in the laboratory, and are instead consistent with those from field experiments on common-pool resource management. This fact suggests caution in generalizing conclusions, reached in the laboratory, to different settings and populations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

We develop and validate a conceptual model of how experiential personal engagement and social-interactive engagement influence active and passive behavior in the emerging form of television that supports and integrates social interaction. The paper describes how personal engagement with the content and social-interactive engagement (resulting from the perceived sense of community, intrinsic enjoyment, and participation experience) differentially influence both active and passive behavior. We test hypotheses using structural equation modeling with survey data from a sample of 814 U. S. and European social TV users. Invariance analyses show the different effect of gender and level of interaction provided (social features) by the social TV Web site.

<p>By introducing n (>1) firms with infinite cross-price elasticity (i.e. generic drugs), we explore the effects of competition on the optimal pricing strategies under a Reference Pricing Scheme (RPS). A two-stage model repeated infinite number of times is presented. When stage 1 is competitive, the equilibrium in pure strategies exists and is efficient only if the reference price (R) does not depend on the price of the branded product. When generics collude, the way R is designed is crucial for both the stability of the cartel among generics and the collusive prices in equilibrium. An optimally designed RPS must set R as a function only of the infinitely elastic side of the market and should provide the right incentives for competition. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

<p>Manuscript Type: Empirical</p>
<p>Research Question/Issue: What determines venture capitalists influence on the governance of firms? How do venture capitalists shape the governance of their investees? Are venture capitalists governance practices consistent across countries? These important questions are under- investigated in the extant literature. In this study, we shed light on the effects of venture capital investors on a large set of governance decisions and we discover the existence of striking cross- country differences.</p>
<p>Research Findings/Insights: We test our conjectures on a unique hand- collected questionnaire- based dataset of 164 companies in five countries and two regions (Europe and the US). Our empirical results show that there is a strong and positive relationship between VCs' funding and their influence on some factors like decisions on CEO hiring, executive compensation, board decisions and appointments. Employee incentives are also positively related to the proportion of VC funding. On the other hand, results show that the proportion of VC funding is only marginally significant in explaining VC influence on strategy direction and investment planning. Our analysis though, offers a remarkably different view after splitting data into European and American subsamples.</p>
<p>Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results provide a novel view of the functioning of the Venture Capital industry and its degree of pervasiveness in the management of portfolio companies. Adopting a unique dataset, we add new evidence on detailed governance decisions, thus supporting the idea that the incremental contribution of a professional investor to a new venture is largely exceeding the capital infusion only. Finally, we show that governance decisions exhibit significant country effects. This evidence supports the view that a global theory of corporate governance cannot rely on a single interpretation framework such as agency theory, but needs to be integrated with predictions from alternative views such institutional theory.</p>
<p>Practitioner/Policy Implications: Corporate governance is the essential mechanism allowing proper management of financial and corporate resources by aligning incentives of employees and investors, thus enabling oversight and control on companies. Yet, corporate governance rules and mechanisms are costly and have different effectiveness across countries. Our results provide guidance to investors in selecting the appropriate set of governance provisions conditional on a set of investment- specific factors.</p>"

<p>Manuscript Type: Review</p>
<p>Research Question/Issue: The article starts as a reflection on the criteria that articles submitted to CGIR should respect in order to pass the screening and referee procedures. Beyond that, the article explores the characteristics of all articles, and particularly of best paper and runner up articles, published recently in the journal. As such the article may be a guide for publishing in the journal and for contributing to the development of a global theory of corporate governance.</p>
<p>Research Findings/Insights: The article is based on both personal reflections of the two screening editors of the journal, and the analysis of all screening decisions taken in 2009, all articles published in the journal in 2008-10, and best papers and runner up articles in 2007-09. Results shows that (1) the most important reasons for desk rejection are the failure to build the paper on the extant literature addressing international corporate governance, a problematic structure of the paper together with substantial editing problems, and the quality of the data collection procedure; (2) the majority of articles published in the journal use both a legal, finance, and economic theoretical framework, and a quantitative research method to analyze how governance mechanisms control value distribution at firm level; (3) best papers and runner up articles have richer theoretical frameworks, more eclectic research methods, and pay explicit attention to the relevance for theory and practice.</p>
<p>Theoretical/Academic Implications: The article emphasizes the importance to balance rigor and relevance to enhance the global understanding of corporate governance.</p>
<p>Practitioner/Policy Implications: The results of the study may be of practical importance for the scholars of various disciplines that want to submit articles to the journal. The ideas contained in this article can help them to refine their articles before the submission to increase the rate of acceptance in the review process and hopefully the publication in the journal. Moreover, we underline that moving forward a global theory of corporate governance could assist practitioners and/or policy makers in developing more efficient governance mechanisms.</p>"

<p>Research to date on service innovation is rooted primarily in traditional new product development focusing on tangible goods. In this article, the authors invoke insights from the emerging service-dominant logic (SDL) perspective and propose a conceptual framework for investigating the antecedents and consequences of service innovation. They then develop a set of hypotheses pertaining to potential predictors of two distinct facets of service innovation (volume and radicalness) and the impact of the latter on two measures of firm performance (revenue growth and profit growth). They test their proposed model using data from a sample of luxury hotels and find that (a) collaborating with customers fosters innovation volume but not radicalness (and vice versa for collaborating with business partners); (b) a firm's customer orientation-both directly and in interaction with innovative orientation-contributes to innovation radicalness; (c) collaborating with contact employees enhances both innovation volume and radicalness; (d) the use of knowledge integration mechanisms contributes to innovation radicalness (but not volume); and (e) both innovation outcomes have significant but somewhat different effects on the two performance measures. They discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of their findings and conclude with the study's limitations and directions for further research.</p>"

<p>Risk managers are often confronted with the evaluation of operational policies in which two or more system components are simultaneously affected by a change. In these instances, the decision-making process should be informed by the relevance of interactions. However, because of system and model complexity, a rigorous study for determining whether and how interactions quantitatively impact operational choices has not been developed yet. In light of the central role played by the multilinearity of the decision support models, we investigate the presence of interactions in multilinear functions first. We identify interactions that can be a priori excluded from the analysis. We introduce sensitivity measures that apportion the model output change to individual factors and interaction contributions in an exact fashion. The sensitivity measures are linked to graphical representation methods as tornado diagrams and Pareto charts, and a systematic way of inferring managerial insights is presented. We then specialize the findings to reliability and probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) problems. We set forth a procedure for determining the magnitude of changes that make interactions relevant in the analysis. Quantitative results are discussed by application to a PSA model developed at NASA to support decision making in space mission planning and design. Numerical findings show that suboptimal decisions concerning the components on which to focus managerial attention can be made, if the decision-making process is not informed by the relevance of interactions.</p>"

<p>We examine how entrepreneurial entry by diversifying and de novo firms in new industries leads to different levels of performance. We propose that these types of firms differ in dynamic capabilities, which help them overcome growth impediments and transition to incumbency in the industry. Growth impediments arise at larger size, older tenure levels in industry, and after technological discontinuities. Because of their prior experience, diversifying firms are better equipped to handle the challenges of impediments to growth. Meanwhile, de novo firms, ostensibly tailor-made for the targeted industry, are more likely to stumble over these growth challenges, and eventually lag behind diversifying firms.

<p>Certificates of Free Sale (CFS) are little known but widely used instruments in international trade. A CFS states that a product meets the regulatory requirements of the exporting country and can be sold freely in that country. Many developing countries require a CFS as a condition of importation in sensitive sectors, such as medical devices, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, cosmetics, and food products. This paper is the first major work to explore the legal implications of certificates of free sale. It describes various CFS requirements and examines the WTO-legality of trade restrictions imposed by importing countries based on the failure of exported goods to meet the domestic standards of the exporting country. The authors conclude that most CFS schemes are likely to violate WTO obligations.

<p>This paper addresses recent calls to narrow the micromacro gap in management research (Bamberger, 2008), by incorporating a macro-level context variable (country) in exploring micro-level determinants of board effectiveness. Following the integrated model proposed by Forbes and Milliken (1999), we identify three board processes as micro-level determinants of board effectiveness. Specifically, we focus on effort norms, cognitive conflicts and the use of knowledge and skills as determinants of board control and advisory task performance. Further, we consider how two different institutional settings influence board tasks, and how the context moderates the relationship between processes and tasks. Our hypotheses are tested on a survey-based dataset of 535 medium-sized and large industrial firms in Italy and Norway, which are considered to substantially differ along legal and cultural dimensions. The findings show that: (i) Board processes have a larger potential than demographic variables to explain board task performance; (ii) board task performance differs significantly between boards operating in different contexts; and (iii) national context moderates the relationships between board processes and board task performance.

Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and EVPI were computed from weighted averages of outputs using two different assignments of the EIR distribution in 2007. Uncertainty was evaluated by resampling of epidemiological, vaccination, and health systems model parameters. Results: Health benefits were predicted consistently only at low transmission, and program costs always substantially exceeded case management savings. Optimal cost-effectiveness was at EIR of about 10 infectious bites per annum (ibpa). Main contributors to ICER uncertainty were uncertainty in transmission intensity, price per vaccine dose, decay rate of the vaccine effect, degree of homogeneity in host response, and some epidemiological model parameters. Other health system costs were unimportant. With a ceiling ratio of 207 international dollars per disability-adjusted life-year averted, 52.4% of parameterizations predicted cost-effectiveness in the primary analysis. Conclusions: Cost-effectiveness of RTS, S will be maximal in low endemicity settings (EIR 2-20 ibpa). Widespread deployment of other transmission-reducing interventions will thus improve cost-effectiveness, suggesting a selective introduction strategy. EVPI is substantial. Accrual of up-to-date information on local endemicity to guide deployment decisions would be highly efficient.</p>"

<p>The creation and intentional pursuit of entrepreneurial ideas lies at the core of the domain of entrepreneurship. Recent empirical work in a number of diverse fields such as cognitive psychology, social cognition, neuroscience, and neurophysiology all suggest that dual processes involving affect and cognition have a significant impact on judgment and decision making. Existing cognitive models ignore this significant role. In this article we develop a framework for understanding the role of affect on idea perception and the intention to develop the entrepreneurial idea. We present a set of testable propositions that link affect to entrepreneurial idea perception through its influence on attention, memory, and creativity. A second set of propositions links affect to the intention to pursue these ideas further. We explore the boundary conditions and moderators of the proposed relationships, and discuss the implications of this framework for existing cognitive and psychological perspectives on entrepreneurship.</p>"

<p>A central motif of health reforms around the world has been the drive to persuade doctors and other clinical professionals to become more actively engaged in the management of services. Examples include moves to extend the commissioning role of primary care doctors (such as general practitioners in the UK) and the introduction of 'clinical directorates' in secondary care. This strategy has been seen as a means of controlling professionals, turning 'poachers into gamekeepers', especially with regard to resource allocation. However, there is also a mounting body of evidence pointing to how clinical leadership may play a role in stimulating quality improvement and new innovations in service design, with positive consequences for patient safety and satisfaction (1). Focusing on the top 100 hospitals in the US Goodall (2) finds a strong positive association between the ranked quality of hospitals and whether the chief executive officer was a clinician. A survey of 1200 hospitals across seven countries (UK, US, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Sweden) conducted by McKinsey and LSE also finds that clinically qualified managers improve both the effectiveness of management decisions and clinical performance of hospitals overall (3).</p>"

<p>Generating ideas for new products used to be the exclusive domain of marketers, engineers, and/or designers. Users have only recently been recognized as an alternative source of new product ideas. Whereas some have attributed great potential to outsourcing idea generation to the crowd of users (crowdsourcing), others have clearly been more skeptical. The authors join this debate by presenting a real-world comparison of ideas actually generated by a firm's professionals with those generated by users in the course of an idea generation contest. Both professionals and users provided ideas to solve an effective and relevant problem in the consumer goods market for baby products. Executives from the underlying company evaluated all ideas (blind to their source) in terms of key quality dimensions including novelty, customer benefit, and feasibility. The study reveals that the crowdsourcing process generated user ideas that score significantly higher in terms of novelty and customer benefit, and somewhat lower in terms of feasibility. However, the average values for feasibilityin sharp contrast to novelty and customer benefittended to be relatively high overall, meaning that feasibility did not constitute a narrow bottleneck in this study. Even more interestingly, it is found that user ideas are placed more frequently than expected among the very best in terms of novelty and customer benefit. These findings, which are quite counterintuitive from the perspective of classic new product development (NPD) literature, suggest that, at least under certain conditions, crowdsourcing might constitute a promising method to gather user ideas that can complement those of a firm's professionals at the idea generation stage in NPD.</p>"

<p>This paper calculates the effects of immigration on the wages of native US workers of various skill levels in two steps. In the first step we use labor demand functions to estimate the elasticity of substitution across different groups of workers. Second, we use the underlying production structure and the estimated elasticities to calculate the total wage effects of immigration in the long run. We emphasize that a production function framework is needed to combine own-group effects with cross-group effects in order to obtain the total wage effects for each native group. In order to obtain a parsimonious representation of elasticities that can be estimated with available data, we adopt alternative nested-CES models and let the data select the preferred specification. New to this paper is the estimate of the substitutability between natives and immigrants of similar education and experience levels. In the data-preferred model, there is a small but significant degree of imperfect substitutability between natives and immigrants which, when combined with the other estimated elasticities, implies that in the period from 1990 to 2006 immigration had a small effect on the wages of native workers with no high school degree (between 0.6% and +1.7%). It also had a small positive effect on average native wages (+0.6%) and a substantial negative effect (-6.7%) on wages of previous immigrants in the long run.</p>"

<p>This paper addresses the issue of forecasting term structure. We provide a unified state-space modeling framework that encompasses different existing discrete-time yield curve models. Within such a framework we analyze the impact of two modeling choices, namely the imposition of no-arbitrage restrictions and the size of the information set used to extract factors, on forecasting performance. Using US yield curve data, we find that both no-arbitrage and large information sets help in forecasting but no model uniformly dominates the other. No-arbitrage models are more useful at shorter horizons for shorter maturities. Large information sets are more useful at longer horizons and longer maturities. We also find evidence for a significant feedback from yield curve models to macroeconomic variables that could be exploited for macroeconomic forecasting.

<p>The effects of environmental regulation on competitiveness are under constant debate for policy-makers and practitioners. The following article reviews the different ways of defining and measuring the effects of environmental regulation on competition and market forces and synthesizes the most recent findings on the relationship between these dimensions. We find that two variables have proved to be both (1) key in defining to what extent and under what conditions environmental regulation exerts adverse or positive effects on competitiveness, and (2) difficult to nail down: forms of regulation and responses by business. The form of regulation may be as important as its stringency in determining the nature of its relationship with competitiveness. The relationship between environmental policies, environmental performance and competitiveness may also vary depending on the characteristics of the businesses and sectors concerned. Taking these factors in the methods of assessment into account may be crucial in understanding the nature of the relationship between environmental regulation and competitiveness.

<p>Adopting a knowledge-based perspective, this study develops a framework of how Italian industrial districts (IDs) operate and evolve as cognitive systems. First, we analyse the mechanisms that facilitate knowledge diffusion across firms within IDs, the enabler of cross-firm knowledge transfer (absorptive capacity) and the process of producing new knowledge by combination. Within this analysis, we consider the formation of new firms resulting from the break-away of human resources from existing district firms (spin-offs) as a particular form of knowledge transfer and production within districts. Knowledge production by combination may take place not only within boundaries of IDs, but also involve external sources. We suggest that innovations made by combining internal and external knowledge have played an important role in shaping the evolutionary trajectories of IDs. Finally, again from the cognitive perspective, we address the issue of how globalization impacts on district systems, concentrating on the positive role that two different types of local actors play in their reproduction and evolution: the global-local firms and institutions providing knowledge-intensive business services.</p>"

<p>In democratic countries, elected policymakers determine public spending. The level of public spending depends on taxes that are decided by a voting mechanism. Policymakers also decide how to allocate funds among different policies, such as public education and pure redistributive transfers. How are the levels of funding for public education and redistribution determined in the political process? What impacts do votes on these two policies have on inequality, growth and social mobility? We develop a politico-economic model that highlights a novel mechanism: public education provides opportunities for the children of the poor to be recognized for their talent. This reduces the probability of a mismatch, which takes place when individuals with low talent who come from rich families find jobs that should go to people with high talent (and vice versa). Hence, the poor may prefer public spending on education to direct redistribution, while the rich prefer redistribution, as education implies more competition for good jobs from the poor.

<p>This paper analyzes the link between cultivation of taste and tourist satisfaction during vacations. A simple model shows that, when cultural capital accumulation matters, customers are ready to sacrifice some of their current utility in order to get higher returns in future, and therefore, the relation between satisfaction and the demand for cultural goods may be convex. On the contrary, when cultivation of taste comes from learning by consuming behavior, the relation is concave. An analysis based on 1,749 interviews in Aosta Valley in Summer 2008 provides some evidence in favor of the cultural capital accumulation hypothesis.</p>"

<p>Knowledge of the determinants of infectious disease transmission is a public health priority as it allows the design of optimal control strategies for endemic or emerging infections. We analyse a detailed dataset on contact patterns across five European countries and use available serological profiles for varicella and parvovirus B19 infections to identify the types of contact that may be most relevant for transmission. We show that models informed by contact data fit well the observed serological profiles of both infections. We find that intimate types of contacts explain the pattern of acquisition of serological markers by age better than other types of social contacts. We observe similar patterns in each of the countries analysed, suggesting that there are consistent biological mechanisms at work. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Background: Despite the existence of varicella vaccine, many developed countries have not introduced it into their national schedules, partly because of concerns about whether herpes zoster (HZ, shingles) will increase due to a lack of exogenous boosting. The magnitude of any increase in zoster that might occur is dependent on rates at which adults and children mix - something that has only recently been quantified - and could be reduced by simultaneously vaccinating older individuals against shingles. This study is the first to assess the cost-effectiveness of combined varicella and zoster vaccination options and compare this to alternative programmes.</p>
<p>Methods and findings: The cost-effectiveness of various options for the use of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) containing vaccines was explored using a transmission dynamic model. Underlying contact rates are estimated from a contemporary survey of social mixing patterns, and uncertainty in these derived from bootstrapping the original sample. The model was calibrated to UK data on varicella and zoster incidence. Other parameters were taken from the literature. UK guidance on perspective and discount rates were followed. The results of the incremental cost-effectiveness analysis suggest that a combined policy is cost-effective. However, the cost-effectiveness of this policy (and indeed the childhood two-dose policy) is influenced by projected benefits that accrue many decades (80-100 years or more) after the start of vaccination. If the programme is evaluated over shorter time frames, then it would be unlikely to be deemed cost-effective, and may result in declines in population health, due to a projected rise in the incidence of HZ. The findings are also sensitive to a number of parameters that are inaccurately quantified, such as the risk of HZ in varicella vaccine responders.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Policy makers should be aware of the potential negative benefits in the first 30-50 years after introduction of a childhood varicella vaccine. This can only be partly mitigated by the introduction of a herpes zoster vaccine. They have to decide how they value the potential benefits beyond this time to consider childhood vaccination cost effective. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This paper tests whether constitutions directly affect economic outcomes. By introducing citizens' political participation as the driving force connecting institutions to policy outcomes, we empirically show that voter turnout is the channel through which forms of government affect economic policies. We provide evidence of the existence of two relationships. First, presidential regimes appear to be associated with lower voter participation in national elections. Second, higher voter participation induces an increase in government expenditure, total revenues, welfare state spending, and budget deficit. We conclude that forms of government affect policy outcomes only through voter turnout. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

The use of VoIP is negatively associated with the usage of other voice communication services mobile communications in particular, but shows some degree of complementarity with other non-voice (Internet-based) communication services, suggesting that familiarity with the web plays a significant and positive role in explaining the adoption of VoIP applications. Furthermore, individual users' technical skills, job position and communications' habits also matter in determining the adoption of VoIP. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) improves the quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS. However, adherence remains a challenge. A total of eight focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted with participants from a randomised controlled trial that monitored strategies for managing ART in African adults: Development of Antiretroviral Therapy. All FGD participants had received ART for at least one year. Perceived benefits of ART were key motivators for adherence. These benefits included improved physical health, restored self-esteem, acceptance in the community and hope for a longer and healthier life and reduced fear of HIV/AIDS-related death. Barriers to adherence included a high pill burden, ART side effects and socio-economic constraints, including lack of food and safe water for taking the pills. Visible ART side effects and involvement in an exclusively HIV/AIDS clinic could expose their HIV status, thus exacerbating stigma. Gender and socioeconomic differences were found in the variety of strategies employed to ensure adherence. ART was perceived as improving the overall quality of life of recipients; however, it is crucial for ART programmes to be gender and socio-economic cognizant in order to enhance adherence to a lifelong therapy.</p>"

<p>The main goal of this article is to assess the impact of product innovation on the economic performance of firms operating in Medium and High-Tech (M&HT) industries. Using information from a large and unique dataset on Italian firms we estimate, by means of Propensity Score (PS) matching methods, a positive and significant ' innovation premium' both in terms of profitability and growth (in the short-run) for those firms who introduced new innovative products. We also find that this innovation premium is particularly large for small firms and even more so when considering new established firms.</p>"

<p>Questionnaires exploring the relativist vs absolutist perception of wellbeing are administered to 3883 students in eight different countries, four low-income countries (Bolivia, Brazil, Kenya and Laos. 1924 respondents) and four high-income countries (Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK, 1959 respondents). Our data reveal that wellbeing is perceived mainly in relative terms with the strength of relativism being higher for respondents in high-income countries. However, when the satisfaction of some 'basic needs' is at stake the absolutist concern becomes powerful. Personal characteristics such as gender and background of studies have a significant role in determining respondents' perception of wellbeing. Finally, additional insights emerge from our study. Interpersonal comparisons take place by looking both 'upward' and 'downward' along the income scale, not only income ranking but also the magnitude of reference incomes plays a role and the perception of wellbeing is more elastic to absolute rather than relative income.

<p>Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore if and to what extent the competency portfolio of entrepreneurs affects firm's performance, controlling for a set of individual and organizational variables.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - Applying nonparametric statistical analysis on data from behavioral event interviews and survey questionnaires to a sample of 53 entrepreneurs (small firm owners), this study investigates: the type, scope and depth of the entrepreneurs' competence portfolio; and the relationship between the entrepreneurs' competence portfolio and their firm performance. The empirical setting is a sample of northeast Italian small family businesses.</p>
<p>Findings - The authors' research shows which are the functional, emotional and cross-functional competencies that differentiate entrepreneurs' performance and identifies which are the threshold competencies (Self-control, Information gathering and Visioning) and the distinctive competencies (Planning, Empathy, Business bargaining, Organizational awareness, Directing others and Benchmarking).</p>
<p>Originality/value - The existing literature on the determinants of successful entrepreneurship mostly focuses on technological, financial and institutional factors, even if entrepreneurs' skills, knowledge, creativity, imagination, and alertness to opportunities are at least as much important in shaping small firms' performance. Building on competency modeling techniques and emotional intelligence literature, this study explores the link between personal characteristics and competencies of entrepreneurs and the performance of their firms. The study offers some managerial implications, provides direction to practitioners and policy makers on how to support entrepreneurship and small business development, and suggests future research directions.</p>"

<p>In this paper, we empirically analyze the factors affecting the cross section of mutual fund fee dispersion. In the context of equity mutual funds, fee dispersion stems primarily from the heterogeneity of products, clienteles and production functions. However, the relevant theory predicts that search costs can also generate fee dispersion. By controlling for observable sources of heterogeneity, we find that fee dispersion decreases with fund size and age, as well as with the amount of assets under management of the investment company. In addition, we find lower levels of fee dispersion for funds that charge marketing and distribution fees. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that these factors are a proxy for some unobserved source of heterogeneity, our results are also consistent with the theoretical prediction that search costs positively affect fee dispersion.

<p>Background: Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by acute symptomatic episodes with variable severity and duration. Pharmacological asthma management aims to achieve and maintain control without side effects, thus improving quality of life and reducing the economic impact. Recently, a clinical trial showed the non-inferiority of beclomethasone/formoterol (BDP/F) versus fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/S) in adults with moderate to severe persistent asthma. However, this study did not provide evidence on costs and did not quantify quality-of-life parameters.</p>
<p>Objective: The objective of the present study was to assess the cost effectiveness and cost utility of BDP/F versus FP/S in patients with moderate to severe asthma from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (NHS).</p>
<p>Methods: A Markov model (MM) was used, with five health states for the different levels of asthma control: successful control, sub-optimal control, outpatient-managed exacerbation, inpatient-managed exacerbation, and death. Model data were derived from the ICAT SE study and from expert panels. Three outcomes were considered: time spent in successful control state, costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).</p>
<p>Results: The model shows that BDP/F treatment led to a slight increase of weeks in successful control compared with FP/S, with a lower cost. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis highlights that in 64% and 68% of the Monte Carlo simulations, BDP/F outperformed FP/S in terms of weeks in successful control and QALYs. Considering the expected cost of the two strategies, in 90% of simulations BDP/F was the least expensive choice. In particular, BDP/F was cost saving as compared with FP/S in about 63% and 59% of simulations as shown by the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analysis, respectively.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Overall, from the Italian NHS perspective, BDP/F treatment is associated with a reduction in cost and offers a slight increase of effectiveness in terms of weeks spent in successful control and QALYs.</p>"

Improved understanding of network dynamics is important for several reasons, perhaps the most critical being that the understanding of network outcomes is only partial without an appreciation of the genesis of the network structures that resulted in such outcomes. To provide a context for the papers in this special issue, and with the broader goal of furthering network dynamics research, we present a framework that begins by discussing the meaning and role of network dynamics and goes on to identify the drivers and key dimensions of network change as well as the role of time in this process.

<p>The success of a brand extension depends largely on the similarity between the brand and its extension product. Recent psychological and neuro-scientific evidence supports a dual-process model that distinguishes taxonomic feature-based similarity from thematic relation-based similarity. In addition to providing a parsimonious organizational framework for prior brand extension research, this dual-process model also provides novel predictions about the processing and evaluation of taxonomic brand extensions (e.g., Budweiser cola) and thematic brand extensions (e.g., Budweiser chips). Results indicate that taxonomic and thematic similarities independently contribute to branding professionals' and lay consumers' evaluations of real and hypothetical brand extensions (Studies 1A and 1B). Counter-intuitively, thematic brand extensions are processed more rapidly (Study 2), judged more novel, and evaluated more positively than taxonomic extensions (Study 3). When induced to consider the commonalities between the brand and the extension product, however, taxonomic extensions are judged more novel and evaluated more positively (Study 3). Implications for brand extension and marketing more generally are discussed. (C) 2011 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

We theorize that consistency between formal and informal networks exerts differing effects on performance. We test our theory in a financial services firm, using secondary data to create formal networks and annual performance evaluations for our dependent variable, along with primary survey data from organizational members to obtain the informal advice and information network.

<p>Despite the increasing level of interest in CSR issues, it is not yet clear what real value the market assigns to social reporting. By applying the value relevance analysis to a sample of 130 European-listed banks, the present work proposes a key to understanding the relationship between social reporting and the value that the market attributes to banks that publicize their commitment to CSR through social reporting. The analysis for the entire sample does not provide evidence that investors attribute value relevance to social reporting (i.e. there is not a significant correlation between the publication of a social report and the stock price). Cross-country analysis shows that in some countries the social report is value-relevant, and positively affects the stock price; in others it remains value-relevant but negatively affects the stock price. Our findings could have several implications for banks, investors, and policymakers. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.</p>"

Controlling for scientific productivity, seniority and gender issues, career progress is explained by: the scientist's affiliation to important public research organizations (scientific and technical human capital - France); his/her social ties with senior members of the discipline, who exercise control over careers (political capital - Italy), and the commitment to work with senior colleagues in his/her own university (political capital - Italy).

Our findings indicate that the appointment of non-family professional CEOs leads to a significant increase in the use of debt, primarily driven by short-term maturities. We document substantial heterogeneity in the impact of professional successions on debt financing: the increase in debt is particularly pronounced for young firms, firms with a high level of investment, and firms in which the controlling family maintains a dominant representation on the board of directors.

Our analysis, based on the time series of risk factors and on the cross-section of abnormal returns. confirms that the split share structure reform was particularly beneficial for small stocks, stocks characterized by historically poor returns, stocks issued by companies with low transparency and weak governance, and for less liquid stocks. Historically neglected stocks also witnessed an increase in the volume of trading and market prices.

<p>Moment-independent sensitivity methods are attracting increasing attention among practitioners, since they provide a thorough way of investigating the sensitivity of model output under uncertainty. However, their estimation is challenging, especially in the presence of computationally intensive models. We argue that replacement of the original model by a metamodel can contribute in lowering the computation burden. A numerical estimation procedure is set forth. The procedure is first tested on analytical cases with increased structural complexity. We utilize the emulator proposed in Ratto and Pagano (2010). Results show that the emulator allows an accurate estimation of density-based sensitivity measures, when the main structural features of the original model are captured. However, performance deteriorates for a model with interactions of order higher than 2. For this test case, also a kriging emulator is investigated, but no gain in performance is registered. However, an accurate estimation is obtained by applying a logarithmic transformation of the model output for both the kriging and Ratto and Pagano (2010) emulators. These findings are then applied to the investigation of a benchmark environmental case study, the LevelE model. Results show that use of the metamodel allows an efficient estimation of moment-independent sensitivity measures while leading to a notable reduction in computational burden. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>Using German microdata and a quasi-natural experiment, we provide evidence on how households respond to an increase in uncertainty.

We also find evidence of a labor supply response by workers who can use the margin offered by part-time employment. Our results are suggestive of the economic effects of ""wars of attrition"": when political disagreement leads to delays in adopting a reform or the possibility that earlier reforms may be revoked, the increased uncertainty could slow the economy.</p>"

<p>In the last three decades, medical doctors have increasingly been exposed to management control measures. This phenomenon has been reflected in a number of studies in various disciplines, including sociology, organisation studies, management, and health service research. This article seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the studies dealing with the impact of management on professional control. In particular, it seeks to bridge the diversity of assumptions, theoretical perspectives and conceptual underpinnings at play, by exploring synergies between them and opening up new horizons for research. The review shows how the relationship between clinicians and management has been analysed at an organisational level using two interconnected analytical frameworks focusing on the sociocultural and task-related dimensions of professionalism. In the final discussion, we argue that comparative, longitudinal and cross-sectional research is necessary, and there is a need to overcome the hegemony/resistance framework in current analyses of the impact of management on professionalism. Such an approach would contribute to the revision of macro theories of professionalism and stimulate emerging research by examining different perspectives towards management in medical specialisations. This approach might also stimulate a discussion of medical professionals relationships with members of other professional groups, including nurses and healthcare managers.</p>"

<p>On tasks that require the mental rotation of 3-dimensional figures, males typically exhibit higher accuracy than females. Using the most common measure of mental rotation (i.e., the Mental Rotations Test), we investigated whether individual variability in confidence mediates this sex difference in mental rotation performance. In each of four experiments, the sex difference was reliably elicited and eliminated by controlling or manipulating participants' confidence. Specifically, confidence predicted performance within and between sexes (Experiment 1), rendering confidence irrelevant to the task reliably eliminated the sex difference in performance (Experiments 2 and 3), and manipulating confidence significantly affected performance (Experiment 4). Thus, confidence mediates the sex difference in mental rotation performance and hence the sex difference appears to be a difference of performance rather than ability. Results are discussed in relation to other potential mediators and mechanisms, such as gender roles, sex stereotypes, spatial experience, rotation strategies, working memory, and spatial attention.</p>"

<p>The notion of transitions is an increasingly central concept in contemporary criminology and such issues are particularly significant in the study of intimate partner violence (IPV). Here, attention focuses on relationship dynamics and movement into and out of relationships for understanding long-term patterns of victimization over the life course. Still, a focus on transitions raises questions about how IPV is patterned over time and across relationships and how this contributes to stability and change in victimization risk over the life span. Our study examines this issue using data from the National Violence Against Women Survey. Findings from latent transition analyses reveal strong evidence for change in victimization experiences across the life course. Among women, those who experienced serious, multifaceted violence are most likely to transition out of relationships followed by transition into subsequent relationships characterized by conflict and aggression and a similar pattern is observed among men. At the same time, men who experience physical aggression in previous relationships are most likely to transition into non-violent relationships, while women with similar experiences are much less differentiated in the types of relationships they enter into. When we account for background characteristics (e.g., respondent's race, education, and age) and childhood experiences of parental violence, the latter is particularly significant in accounting for exposure to serious IPV in later adulthood. Such findings extend our understanding of how life course transitions connect to violence and offending and highlight processes of continuity and change beyond the traditional focus on criminal offending.</p>"

<p>Objective: To investigate stakeholder involvement by Health Technology Assessment Organisations (HTAOs) in France, Spain, England and Wales, Germany, Sweden, and The Netherlands and to examine whether this involvement depends on (i) the administrative tradition and the relevant conception of the relationship between state and society (contractarian and corporative vs. organic), (ii) the general structure of the healthcare system (HCS) (Bismarckian vs. Beveridgian system), and (iii).the role of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and HTAOs in the HCS.</p>
<p>Methods: Given the exploratory nature of the study, we considered interviews based on semi-structured questionnaires the most appropriate data-gathering technique. The interviews were administered to 16 key personnel in the HTAOs concerned. We have also carried out a literature review on HTAOs and stakeholders (1999-2011) using PubMed, Ebsco, JSTOR and Wiley Science.</p>
<p>Results: In contractarian and (to a lesser extent) Bismarckian models, stakeholders are more involved. The administrative tradition and the HCS appear less important when the HTA is binding and used for regulatory purposes. In such situations, stakeholders are more intensively involved because their participation provides an opportunity for HTAOs to achieve consensus and legitimacy in advance.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Despite the limitations of the research (we did not conduct multiple interviews for each HTAO, and key informants were not always available) and its exploratory nature, we can conclude that models of stakeholders involvement cannot easily be transferred from one country to another due to the importance of national administrative traditions and the characteristics of HCSs.

<p>From a study of three large design firms in Italy, the UK and the USA, we derive a distinct model of how large knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) firms organize to manage growth and realize economies in ways that differ from the organizational techniques that are familiar from scale and scope studies of large manufacturing enterprises. Case studies were compiled from interviews conducted at the three firms. Large design firms were selected as a contrasting context to Chandlerian manufacturing firms. Design firms were expected to differ from manufacturing firms in terms of strategy, organization and the overall possibilities of achieving economies of scale and scope. Our results show that competitive advantage of these large KIBS design firms derives from a particular multi-unit skill system that enables the firms to exploit economies of scope. There are four distinctive organizational features of such KIBS firms. First, multiple business units within the firm play a dual role. These are able both to engage in inter-unit coordination and resource sharing and to attract business independently, often with heterogeneous business models among units. Second, these firms develop formal organizational routines for involving multiple business units in client projects, thus facilitating the migration of clients' business from one unit to another. Third, there is an important role for cross-unit strategic insight agents. Fourth, these firms expand through the founding of specialized, even idiosyncratic, new business units (often with the important role of mastering new technological skills).</p>"

We argue that there is a strong mutual interdependence of trade and scientific knowledge production, as a result of which we expect the geographic configuration of global knowledge and trade networks to coevolve. Our results show that, over time, only a few New World wine producers developed trade and scientific collaboration networks that resemble those of traditional Old World producers.

<p>Agricultural sectors play a key role in the economics of climate change. Land as an input to agricultural production is one of the most important links between economy and the biosphere, representing a direct projection of human action on the natural environment. Agricultural management practices and cropping patterns exert an enormous effect on biogeochemical cycles, freshwater availability and soil quality. Agriculture also plays an important role in emitting and storing greenhouse gases. To consistently investigate climate policy and future pathways for the economic and natural environment, a realistic representation of agricultural land use is essential. Top-down Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models have increasingly been used for this purpose. CGE models simulate the simultaneous equilibrium in a set of interdependent markets, and are especially suited to analyze agricultural markets from a global perspective. However, modeling agricultural sectors in CGE models is not a trivial task, mainly because of differences in temporal and geographic aggregation scales. This study surveys some proposed modeling strategies and highlights different tradeoffs involved in the various approaches. Coupling of top-down and bottom-up models is found to be the most applicable for comprehensive analysis of agriculture in prism of climate change. However, linking interdisciplinary data, methods and outputs is still the major obstacle to be solved for wide-scale implementation.</p>"

<p>This study explores whether, to what extent, and under which conditions modular products are associated with modular organizations (the ""mirroring"" hypothesis). We analyze the product and organizational architectures of three firms in the air conditioning industry through an original data set of 100 components and supply relationships. Applying a variety of regression methods, we show that, under the condition of product architecture stability at the component level, supplier relations for loosely coupled components are characterized by less information sharing, which implies that the degree of coupling of product components varies directly with the degree of coupling of organizations (the ""mirroring"" hypothesis). Also, the performance of supply relationships depends on the amount of buyer supplier information sharing but not on the degree of component modularity, which supports the relational view and confirms that product modularity does not have unambiguous effects on organizational performance. Moreover, the degree of component modularity negatively moderates the impact of buyer supplier information sharing on supplier-relationship performance, which confirms that component modularity works as an ex ante, embedded substitute for high-powered interorganizational integration mechanisms. Finally, contingent on firms' strategies, organizational structures, and capabilities, we argue that at the firm level, higher product modularity may be associated either with less information sharing with suppliers, which implies that the mirroring effect might hold also at the firm level, or with more information sharing with suppliers, which implies that there may be increasing returns to modularity in design efforts because of interorganizational integration (the ""complementarity"" hypothesis).</p>"

In the first two sections I shall analyze Shapiro's jurisprudential approach by focusing on its resort to metaphysical vocabulary, conceptual analysis, constructive reasoning, and institutional explanation of law.

<p>The process leading to the setting of the minimum wage so far has been overlooked by economists. There are two common ways of setting national minimum wages: they are either government legislated or the byproduct of collective bargaining agreements, which are extended erga omnes to all workers. We develop a simple model relating the level of the minimum wage to the setting regime. Next, we exploit a new data set on minimum wages in 68 countries having a statutory national minimum level of pay in the period 1981-2005. We find that a Government legislated minimum wage is lower than a wage floor set within collective agreements. This effect survives to several robustness checks and can be interpreted as a causal effect of the setting regime on the level of the minimum wage. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>In this study, the authors investigate how network relations affect project performance through creativity. They challenge previous conceptualizations of creativity by proposing the idea that creative outcomes in project industries can be conceptualized as deviation from past projects and deviation from partners' projects. While previous research has mostly assumed that network relations are beneficial to performance because they increase innovation and creativity, this conceptualization of creativity reveals different empirical regularities. The authors show that network relations are likely to exercise both positive and negative effects on creativity and that creativity is also likely to exercise both positive and negative effects on performance. In addition, networks show both convergent and divergent effects on the two dimensions of creativity. The findings show that network relations activate important trade-offs that organizations must consider in their strategic choices and open up research on the social side of creativity.</p>"

<p>We discuss how standard computable equilibrium models of trade policy can be enriched with selection effects. This is achieved by estimating and simulating a partial equilibrium model that accounts for a number of real world effects of trade liberalisation: richer availability of product varieties; tougher competition and weaker market power of firms; better exploitation of economies of scale; and, of course, efficiency gains via firms selection. The model is estimated on EU data and then simulated in counterfactual scenarios. Gains from trade are much larger in the presence of selection effects with substantial variability across countries and sectors.</p>"

<p>A novel class of hierarchical nonparametric Bayesian survival regression models for time-to-event data with uninformative right censoring is introduced. The survival curve is modeled as a random function whose prior distribution is defined using the beta-Stacy (BS) process. The prior mean of each survival probability and its prior variance are linked to a standard parametric survival regression model. This nonparametric survival regression can thus be anchored to any reference parametric form, such as a proportional hazards or an accelerated failure time model, allowing substantial departures of the predictive survival probabilities when the reference model is not supported by the data. Also, under this formulation the predictive survival probabilities will be close to the empirical survival distribution near the mode of the reference model and they will be shrunken towards its probability density in the tails of the empirical distribution.</p>
<p>Examples of our approach are presented using a Weibull-centered BS process whose variance decreases proportionally to the centering Weibull probability density function. By the conjugacy of the BS process to random right censoring, marginal posterior inferences for the survival probabilities and for the regression coefficients are approximated using the standard Gibbs sampler. Three applications of the BS Weibull survival regression model are illustrated, focussing on toxicological and clinical data and comparing the BS model estimates with those of standard parametric and semiparametric survival regressions.

<p>Using archival sources, the authors study strategic and organizational change in the International Labour Organization (ILO) over the last twenty years. They focus specifically on the ILO's efforts to incorporate certain elements of the ""new governance"" model into its policies and organizational practices, which include the shift from standards expressed as detailed legal norms to ""soft law""; the active involvement of civil society organizations other than trade unions and employer associations in regulatory activities; and the introduction of quantitative indicators of compliance with labor standards. They argue that the efforts of the ILO leadership have been waylaid by the organization's corporatist structure, which gives employer associations and trade unions veto power over policy developments at a time in which these actors are increasingly unable to agree on concrete policy measures. Finally, the authors ask whether this corporatist structure accurately reflects the ILO's self-defined mission: providing ""decent work for all.""</p>"

<p>We propose a new approach to forecasting the term structure of interest rates, which allows to efficiently extract the information contained in a large panel of yields. In particular, we use a large Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVAR) with an optimal amount of shrinkage towards univariate AR models. The optimal shrinkage is chosen by maximizing the Marginal Likelihood of the model. Focusing on the US, we provide an extensive study on the forecasting performance of the proposed model relative to most of the existing alternative specifications. While most of the existing evidence focuses on statistical measures of forecast accuracy, we also consider alternative measures based on trading schemes and portfolio allocation. We extensively check the robustness of our results, using different datasets and Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the proposed BVAR approach produces competitive forecasts, systematically more accurate than random walk forecasts, even though the gains are small. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

<p>The purpose of this paper is two-fold: first, we propose a method for checking empirically whether inflation expectations are anchored in the long run, and at what level. The extent of anchoring then serves as a proxy for the credibility of the monetary authority. Second, to assess how well this measure proxies credibility, we cross-check it against periods for which the level of credibility is known and generally agreed upon. To this end, we apply our measure to the US inflation history since 1963, which includes both the period of the Great Inflation, in which credibility was poor and deteriorating, as well as the period of the Great Moderation during which credibility in the monetary authority was gradually re-established. Finally we check what our measure of credibility tells us about the crisis period.</p>"

<p>Over the last two decades, health policy and governance in Italy have undergone decentralisation at the regional level. The central government was expected to play a guiding role in defining minimum care standards and controlling health expenditures at the regional level in order to keep the entire Italian National Health System (INHS) on track. Although health performance trends have been consistent across regions, public health expenditures have been variable and contributed to a cumulative deficit of 38 billion Euros from 2001 to 2010. To address the deficit, the government called for a resolution introducing a partial bail-out plan and later institutionalised a process to facilitate a turnaround. The upturn started with the development of a formal regional turnaround plan that proposed strategic actions to address the structural determinants of costs. The effectiveness of this tool was widely questioned, and many critics suggested that it was focused more on methods to address short-term issues than on the long-term strategic reconfiguration that is required for regional health systems to ultimately address the structural causes of deficits. We propose an interpretative framework to understand the advantages and disadvantages of turnaround plans, and we apply the findings to the development of policy recommendations for the structure, methods, processes and contexts of the implementation of this tool.

<p>The global economic and financial crisis is having and impact on the Italian healthcare system which is undergoing a devolution process from the central government to regions and where about one third of the regional governments (mainly in the central and southern part of the country) are facing large financial deficits. The paper briefly describes the current macro scenario and the main responses taken to face the crisis and highlights the downside risks of introducing ""linear"" cuts in the allocation of resources. While justified by the risk of a national debt default, present fiscal policies might increase inequalities in access to care, deteriorate overall health indicators and population wellbeing, and sharpen existing difference in the quality of care between regions. Preliminary evidence shows that the crisis is affecting the quality of nutrition and the incidence of psychiatric disorders. During this difficult financial situation Italy is also facing the risk of a major reduction in investments for preventive medicine, Evidence Based Medicine infrastructures, health information systems and physical capital renewal. This cost-cutting strategy may have negative long term consequences Also, important achievement in terms of limiting waiting lists, improving continuity of care and patients' centeredness, and promoting integration between social and health care may be negatively affected by unprecedented resources' cuts. It is essential that in such a period of public funding constraints health authorities monitor incidence of diseases and access to care of the most vulnerable groups and specifically target interventions to those who may be disproportionally hit by the crisis.

The study suggests that the web appears to be the favorite direct marketing tool for informing or retaining 'inexpert drama lovers', namely those who fish in different types of performing arts events (i.e. opera, ballet, and classical concert) or attend different types of theatres. Moreover, internet may combat the aging of the performing arts audience by giving priority to access to those that are more familiar with the new technologies (i.e. younger audience).</p>"

In both decision settings, relying on the Choquet expected utility model, we study how the decision maker's risk and ambiguity attitudes affect the reservation price for ambiguity resolution. These effects are analyzed for different levels of ambiguity of the act. Operating instructions for the elicitation of the reservation price for ambiguity resolution in an experimental setting are provided at the end of the article.</p>"

<p>Descriptive statistics indicate that civil marriages and marriages preceded by premarital cohabitation are more unstable, i.e., more frequently followed by divorce. However, the literature has shown that selectivity plays an important role in the relationship between premarital cohabitation and union dissolution. We do not have evidence to date regarding the selectivity in the effect of civil marriage. The Italian case appears particularly interesting given the recent diffusion of premarital cohabitation and civil marriage. Using micro-level data from a national-level representative survey conducted in 2003, we develop a multiprocess model that allows unobserved heterogeneity to be correlated across the three decisions (premarital cohabitation, civil marriage, and divorce). Our results show that selectivity is the main factor that explains the higher divorce rates among those who experience premarital cohabitation and a civil marriage. Net of selectivity, the causal effect on union dissolution disappears.</p>"

<p>The use of codification to support knowledge transfer across projects has been explored in several recent, and mostly qualitative, studies. Building on that research, this article puts forward hypotheses about the antecedents of knowledge codification, and tests them on a sample of 540 inter-organizational projects carried out in the creative, high-tech and engineering industries. We find that the presence of strong industry norms governing the division of labour discourages knowledge transfer through codification, as suggested by the existing qualitative studies. The presence of a system integrator plays an important role in driving the use of codification for knowledge transfer, to some extent embodying an organizational memory in volatile project environments. Finally, the level of use of administrative control in the project is a robust predictor of attempts to transfer knowledge via codification. When these antecedents are taken into account, the novelty of products and services plays a smaller role than previously found in determining the use of codification.</p>"

<p>Celebrity endorsement is a common influence tactic used by marketers. By linking their brands with cultural entities such as celebrity endorsers, marketers attempt to acquire positive meanings and personality traits associated with the entity. Entities, however, often have both positive and negative associations. For example, a celebrity can be both smart and arrogant, or sexy and ditsy. We highlight a risk of meaning transfer: negative associations are more likely to transfer to a brand than positive associations. Three studies show that brands are more likely to acquire the negative than the positive personality traits associated with a celebrity endorser and that negative associations transfer even under conditions that inhibit the transfer of positive associations.</p>"

<p>The article examines the implementation by the Italian Ministry of Health of performance-based funding to allocate resources for research to IRCCS (Istituti di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico) hospitals. The analysis provides evidence that ten years from its introduction the performance-based funding system has persisted, but it has been implemented rather differently from what had been imagined by its proponents. By drawing on the theoretical frameworks of policy implementation, agency, and relational contracting, the study establishes that the overall design of the system has contributed to this final outcome only to a limited extent. Rather, the lack of procedural fairness, as well as of political leadership in linking the system to national research priorities, has undermined the basis for trust between hospitals and the Ministry of Health. The article discusses how, in this, the governance of performance-based funding and its strong ownership by the ministerial bureaucracy has been determinant.</p>"

<p>This paper critically discusses one of the prescriptions of traditional control literature according to which the management accounting system (MAS) should be adaptive to changes in the organizational and strategic context. Drawing from contingency and institutional theories, the paper drafts a framework to pragmatically identify key phases and features of the management accounting change process to highlight its organizational nature. Using this framework, the paper documents four longitudinal case studies of the design and the implementation of management accounting changes. The field studies show how accounting systems are difficult to change despite the formally acknowledged need for change. Findings highlight that the need for change, the technical feasibility of change, the availability of traditional, and the contemporary methodologies are - alone - insufficient reasons to change. A number of other elements interplay in the process of change, namely, the intended MAS use, the stage of the organization life cycle, the potential impact of change on the organization, and the role of key individuals in linking the phases of the change process.</p>"

<p>The purpose of this paper is to explain the reasons why collaborating firms ""open their books"" and share management accounting information. We investigate the effect of variables related to the tasks and relationships of single individuals of the partner firms (i.e., task interdependence and analysability, team interdependence and relationship duration) on open book accounting (OBA). Our model controls for firm-level variables (i.e., asset specificity, degree of economic dependence, contract presence, contract comprehensiveness, and firm size) known to influence management accounting information exchanges. By using social network analysis (SNA), the data collected from a fashion firm and its entire set of suppliers shows that the quantity of management accounting information is positively related to task interdependence while having an inverted U-shape relation with the duration of the relationship. In addition, it provides evidence of a positive association with task analysability, whereas we find no relation with team interdependence. The analysis also confirms the importance of firm-level factors in explaining the exchanges of management accounting information. Our conclusions have important implications for the design of OBA in inter-organisational relationships. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Although the importance of integrating the voice of the customer into new product development is almost universally accepted, the techniques used by many organizations to identify customers' needs have stagnated. The most commonly used techniques, focus groups and surveys (including both interviews and questionnaires), have significant limitations. Customers often struggle to articulate their needs in interviews, and focus groups often generate incremental ideas rather than breakthroughs. Companies in the service sector face an additional challenge, as their customers need to discuss services, which are by their nature intangible. One of the most promising approaches to generating a deeper customer understanding is ethnographic market research, which adopts ideas from ethnography, the set of tools social scientists use to study tribal cultures. These techniques can provide deep customer insights, but their application to new product development is not well studied. We explain the key elements of ethnographic market research, present four cases from the manufacturing and service sectors, and discuss the implications for managers.</p>"

<p>In current research on market categories, hybridity (i.e., the association of organizations and/or the products they offer with multiple category memberships) represents an important issue with many practical implications, especially for project-based forms of organizations. This chapter explores the evolution of hybridity and the conditions under which different kinds of project-based organizations develop hybrid projects. By studying the feature film industry in the United States from 1920 until 1970, this chapter contrasts the current perspective based on status-organizing processes and suggests that hybridity is a population-level process that can be interpreted as the result of the construction and interplay of different identities, and on the dynamic of the identity dimensions employed by different actors in such effort. The chapter shows that the development and construction of the identity of a temporary organization is different from other types of organizations, and is linked to identification processes both at the organizational level, with the company or with specific individuals in key roles, and at the institutional/collective level, with pure (single-category) and hybrid (multi-category) genres. This chapter highlights the mutual interactions and constraints between these two levels in different life stages of the film industry.</p>"

<p>Though overall bank performance from July 2007 to December 2008 was the worst since the Great Depression, there is significant variation in the cross-section of stock returns of large banks across the world during that period. We use this variation to evaluate the importance of factors that have been put forth as having contributed to the poor performance of banks during the credit crisis. The evidence is supportive of theories that emphasize the fragility of banks financed with short-term capital market funding. The better-performing banks had less leverage and lower returns immediately before the crisis. Differences in banking regulations across countries are generally uncorrelated with the performance of banks during the crisis, except that large banks from countries with more restrictions on bank activities performed better and decreased loans less. Our evidence poses a substantial challenge to those who argue that poor bank governance was a major cause of the crisis because we find that banks with more shareholder-friendly boards performed significantly worse during the crisis than other banks, were not less risky before the crisis, and reduced loans more during the crisis.

<p>We define a class of reinforced urn processes, based on Hoppe's urn scheme, that are Markov exchangeable, with a countable and possibly unknown state space. This construction extends the reinforced urn processes developed by Muliere et al. (2000) and widely used in Bayesian nonparametric inference and survival analysis. We also shed light on the connections with apparently unrelated constructions, recently proposed in the machine learning literature, such as the infinite hidden Markov model, offering a general framework for a deeper study of their theoretical properties.

<p>This paper investigates the determinants of the compensation structure for brokers who advise customers regarding the suitability of financial products. Our model explains why brokers are commonly compensated indirectly through contingent commissions paid by product providers, even though this compensation structure could lead to biased advice. When customers are wary of the adviser's incentives, contingent commissions can be an effective incentive tool to induce the adviser to learn which specialized product is most suitable for the specific needs of customers. If, instead, customers naively believe they receive unbiased advice, high product prices and correspondingly high commissions become a tool of exploitation. Policy intervention that mandates disclosure of commissions can protect naive consumers and increase welfare. However, prohibiting or capping commissions could have the unintended consequence of stifling the adviser's incentive to acquire information. More vigorous competition benefits consumers and reduces exploitation, but firms have limited incentives to educate naive customers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Risk achievement worth is one of the most widely utilized importance measures. RAW is defined as the ratio of the risk metric value attained when a component has failed over the base case value of the risk metric. Traditionally, both the numerator and denominator are point estimates. Relevant literature has shown that inclusion of epistemic uncertainty (i) induces notable variability in the point estimate ranking and (ii) causes the expected value of the risk metric to differ from its nominal value. We investigate the conditions under which the equality of the nominal and expected values of a reliability risk metric holds. We then study how the presence of epistemic uncertainty affects RAW and the associated ranking. We propose an extension of RAW (called ERAW) which allows one to obtain a ranking robust to epistemic uncertainty. We discuss the properties of ERAW and the conditions under which it coincides with RAW. We apply our findings to a probabilistic risk assessment model developed for the safety analysis of NASA lunar space missions. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>BACKGROUND It is well known that the provision of public childcare plays an important role for women labour force participation and its availability varies tremendously across countries. In many countries, informal childcare is also important and typically provided by the grandparents, but its role on mothers' employment is not yet well understood. Understanding the relationship between labour supply decisions and grandparental childcare is complex. While the provision of grandparental childcare is clearly a function of the social and institutional context of a country, it also depends on family preferences, which are typically unobserved in surveys.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE We analyze the role of informal childcare provided by grandparents on mothers' labour force participation keeping unobserved preferences into account.</p>
<p>METHODS Bivariate probit models with instrumental variables are estimated on data from seven countries (Bulgaria, France, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Russia and The Netherlands) drawn from the Generations and Gender Survey.</p>
<p>RESULTS We find that only in some countries mothers' employment is positively and significantly associated with grandparents providing childcare. In other countries, once we control for unobserved preferences, we do not find this effect.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS The role of grandparents is an important element to reconcile work and family for women in some countries. Our results show the importance of considering family preferences and country differences when studying the relationship between grandparental childcare and mothers' labour supply.</p>
<p>COMMENTS Our results are consistent with previous research on this topic. However, differently from previous studies, we conduct separate analyses by country and show that the effect of grandparental childcare varies considerably. The fact that we also include in the analyses Bulgaria, Hungary, Russia and Georgia is an important novelty as there are no studies on this issue for these countries.</p>"

<p>In this article, the authors investigate the short-run educational expectations and long-term educational aspirations of the children of immigrants living in Italy and attending eighth grade. The authors look at educational ambition, both as a predictor of educational choice and as a measure of social integration. They consider both secondary-school track and university goals. Data come from the ITAGEN2 survey (2005-2006). First, the authors analyze the relationship of short-run expectations and long-term aspirations to structural (e.g., migration status and country of origin) and social (e.g., family socioeconomic status and friendship ties) conditions. The latter seem to be determinants of both expectations and aspirations, but long-term educational aspirations are not associated with migration status. Second, the authors investigate the relevance of context in delineating educational attitudes. The authors performed a multilevel analysis including both individual- and school-level variables. Their results show that attending a school where most of the Italian pupils have high educational expectations may lead children of immigrants to enhance their own aspirations.</p>"

<p>Introduction: Integrated care pathways (ICPs) have been proposed as effective strategies for quality improvement. To date, limited data are available that detail the methodology to design an optimal care pathway for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The main aim of this study was to assess the quality of health care delivered to lung cancer patients referred to a hub university hospital.</p>
<p>Methods: All professionals involved with the management of NSCLC patients, in cooperation with health care researchers, identified 11 quality indicators and associated benchmarks. These were used to estimate the quality and efficiency of health care delivered to a cohort of 175 NSCLC patients.</p>
<p>Results: The gap between ""desired"" and ""actual"" performance has been measured by benchmarking current practice against key quality indicators. Diagnostic workup, multidisciplinary team care and medical treatment of advanced disease have emerged as areas of good performance. Conversely, the management of early-stage disease offers room for improvement, in terms of both accuracy of nodal staging and surgical timeliness.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Analyzing the process of caring for NSCLC patients is feasible and offers room for improvement. Acquired knowledge may be shared with hospital administrators, guide the revision of ICPs, and enable the delivery of consistent, high-quality clinical standards.</p>"

<p>To devise a multivariate parametric model for short-term prediction of disability using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and multimodal sensory EP (mEP). A total of 221 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients who underwent repeated mEP and EDSS assessments at variable time intervals over a 20-year period were retrospectively analyzed. Published criteria were used to compute a cumulative score (mEPS) of abnormalities for each of 908 individual tests. Data of a statistically balanced sample of 58 patients were fed to a parametrical regression analysis using time-lagged EDSS and mEPS along with other clinical variables to estimate future EDSS scores at 1 year. Whole sample cross-sectional mEPS were moderately correlated with EDSS, whereas longitudinal mEPS were not. Using the regression model, lagged mEPS and lagged EDSS along with clinical variables provided better future EDSS estimates. The R (2) measure of fit was significant and 72% of EDSS estimates showed an error value of +/- 0.5. A parametrical regression model combining EDSS and mEPS accurately predicts short-term disability in MS patients and could be used to optimize decisions concerning treatment.</p>"

<p>Research on management control has emphasised the relevance of controls for knowledge integration on a project-by-project basis. This work contributes to this field by proposing a framework to explain how management control systems foster knowledge transfer between organisational units in knowledge-intensive firms. By combining network theory and knowledge network research, this study suggests that the design of management control systems should consider various forms of relationships between individuals (strong/weak, direct/indirect) that these systems activate and that are necessary to transfer various forms of knowledge (process, outcome, technology or opportunities) characterised by different levels of causal ambiguity and relatedness. An in-depth empirical analysis of a software firm and three of its projects shows that management controls may act as important mechanisms of knowledge circulation and that some principles reinforce this function. In particular, to achieve organisational knowledge transfer, enforceability of manuals and procedures, scalability of reviews and decisions, mobility induction of individuals, and multiplicity of roles and accountabilities are indicated as desirable design properties of control systems in knowledge-intensive firms.</p>"

<p>Counterfeiting is a widespread practice throughout the world. The conventional wisdom is that it affects branded goods negatively. In this paper, however, we suggest that counterfeiting may actually benefit certain luxury brands. By means of two studies, we show how the market presence of luxury counterfeit items can increase consumers' willingness to pay for original brands. In Study 1, we show that the presence of luxury counterfeits can increase consumers' willingness to pay for well-known original brands, but not for lesser-known ones. Brand awareness plays a moderating role in the positive relationship between counterfeiting and willingness to pay (WTP). In Study 2, we address the psychological mechanisms that explain this increased willingness to pay. The results show that consumers' (a) pleasure at being envied, (b) pleasure in distinguishing themselves, and (c) perception of the quality of the original goods fully mediate the relation between the presence of counterfeit in the market and consumers' WTP for originals. We subsequently discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the two study results.</p>"

<p>This article examines the role of similarity in the hybridization of concepts, focusing on hybrid products as an applied test case. Hybrid concepts found in natural language, such as singer songwriter, typically combine similar concepts, whereas dissimilar concepts rarely form hybrids. The hybridization of dissimilar concepts in products such as jogging shoe mp3 player and refrigerator TV thus poses a challenge for understanding the process of conceptual combination. It is proposed that models of conceptual combination can throw light on the judged future success and desirability of hybrid products in general. The composite prototype model proposes two stages of conceptual combination. In the first stage, the concepts are aggregated into an additive hybrid, simply by forming the union of the two sets of attributes. In the second stage, any conflicting attributes are identified and resolved, often with the introduction of emergent attributes, resulting in an integrative hybrid. Across four studies that varied the similarity and type of hybrid products, similar and integrative hybrids were valued more than dissimilar and additive hybrids. Critically, though, dissimilar hybrids were also highly valued if they were integrative. Results supported the two stages proposed by the composite prototype model, and implications for other models of hybrid formation are discussed.</p>"

<p>Companies increasingly make use of geographically dispersed teams to capture knowledge residing at different locations. In this context, shared leadership is considered a key enabler of team performance. Taking a functional perspective on shared leadership, we thus investigate the relationship between shared leadership behaviors and team performance in dispersed teams. Furthermore, we analyze how socio-demographic factors that are characteristic for dispersed teams (i.e., high female-to-male ratio, high mean age, and high levels of national diversity) affect shared leadership behaviors. Based on data from 96 dispersed teams, we show that shared leadership behavior fosters team performance. Further, we find the socio-demographic characteristics typical for dispersed teams to foster shared leadership. Theoretical and managerial implications for human resource management are discussed.

<p>Stakeholder theory scholars have recently addressed two crucial calls: the first is for the integration of strategy and ethics, of stakeholder theory and strategic management, and the second call is for the development of a dynamic approach to stakeholder management. I have attempted to answer these calls by developing a theoretical framework that links together stakeholder management, stakeholder commitment to cooperate with the firm, key decision makers' ethical commitment, and firm strategy. Starting from the basic assumption that managers cannot meet all stakeholders' demands immediately and in a tailored manner, I contend, first, that an ambidextrous approach to stakeholder management is conducive to stakeholders' commitment to cooperate for the sustainable well-being of the firm and, second, that firm strategy and key decision makers' ethical commitment moderate the relationship between an ambidextrous stakeholder management and stakeholder commitment to cooperate. Furthermore, drawing on this theoretical framework, I attempt to address the call for the integration of strategy and ethics by proposing a three-level conceptual model that distinguishes the objectives, the field, and the levers of integration. Finally, I outline a set of propositions that, taken together, represent a first attempt to develop a dynamic approach to stakeholder management.</p>"

<p>Information on the link between market performance and corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities provides an indication of the extent of acceptance by investors of these types of activities. The nature of this relationship is of critical importance for management trying to reconcile the demands of the company's shareholders with those of a much wider group of stakeholders and for investors pursuing a socially responsible investing strategy. Using an international database we investigate the extent to which expenditures on CSR activities are valued across market in six countries/regions. We find that CSR activities are highly valued by the investors in the European markets, where our findings clearly indicate that such activities lead to higher market valuations. In the US, Japan and Australia expenditures on CSR activities have a neutral impact on company valuation, which is still a good outcome for management who wish to incorporate into their decision process the objectives of a wide spectrum of stakeholders and for investors wishing to tilt their investments towards the more socially responsible companies.</p>"

Then, controlling for trust in the regression of market failures on regulation, the latter is no longer associated with worse economic outcomes.

<p>Integration of research and development (R&D) with marketing remains a frequent topic in the new product development (NPD) literature, largely because it represents a critical antecedent of new product performance (NPP). Two divergent opinions about this integration exist, such that those who contend that firms should pursue high levels of integration in every case provoke criticisms from those who propose that various NPD processes require different levels of integration. This paper proposes that the two perspectives can be reconciled by taking into account the fact that R&D and marketing are integrated mainly to combine critical knowledge (technological and market) that otherwise would be separate to achieve market success. Following Danneels's approach, we investigate how the effect of R&Dmarketing integration on performance change across four types of NPD processes: pure exploitation, pure exploration, technological competence exploitation, and market competence exploitation. Data derived from a deep study of 11 NPD projects by five firms, analyzed through qualitative methods, highlight the necessity to vary the level of integration according to the type of competence to be developed during the NPD process. Our analysis suggests two main conclusions. First, the effect of integration depends strictly on the type of competence that the firm uses to develop and launch a new product. Second, integration does not have a unique effect on performance, but it is necessary to distinguish between market performance (e.g., sales and market share) and process performance (e.g., meeting the planned budget and time to market). In some projects, the effect of integration on the two types of performance is diametrically opposite. In particular, we propose that (1) higher performance will be associated with lower integration in pure exploitative projects; (2) in projects that exploit existing market knowledge, higher market performance will be associated with a higher integration, although these projects tend to offer poor process performance regardless of integration level; (3) in projects that exploit technical knowledge, higher performance will be associated with higher integration; and (4) higher integration will be associated with higher market performance but poorer process performance in pure explorative projects.</p>"

First, the determinants of deprivation are analysed by using individual fixed effects models for each country separately. Second, a decomposition of the deprivation gaps between countries highlights the main reasons for the differentials across Europe. The results show that changes in income and deprivation do not strictly coincide and highlight the importance of employment status and income sources. In countries where deprivation is higher income is more effective in reducing the deprivation differential. However, a relevant part of the deprivation gap is attributable to a country specific effect revealing the importance of unobserved factors like cultural attitudes and institutions.</p>"

<p>This paper presents an experimental investigation of persuasion bias, a form of bounded rationality whereby agents communicating through a social network are unable to account for repetitions in the information they receive. We find that, after repeated communication within a social network, social influence depends not only on being listened to by many others, but also on listening to many others. We show that persuasion bias can be viewed as an extreme case of a generalized boundedly rational updating rule in which agents receive more or less attention depending on how many other agents they listen to. The results indicate that behavior in the experiment is consistent with an updating rule according to which agents' social influence is proportional to their indegree. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

<p>A large body of literature has argued that social capital (i.e. 'good culture') reduces transaction costs and boosts investment by households and firms.

In particular, I present some econometric evidence on the correlation between social capital and entrepreneurship.

<p>This paper examines how the nature of the technological regime governing innovative activities and the structure of demand interact in determining market structure, with specific reference to the pharmaceutical industry. The key question concerns the observation that-despite high degrees of R&D and marketing-intensity-concentration has been consistently low during the whole evolution of the industry. Standard explanations of this phenomenon refer to the random nature of the innovative process, the patterns of imitation, and the fragmented nature of the market into multiple, independent submarkets. We delve deeper into this issue by using an improved version of our previous ""history-friendly"" model of the evolution of pharmaceuticals. Thus, we explore the way in which changes in the technological regime and/or in the structure of demand may generate or not substantially higher degrees of concentration. The main results are that, while technological regimes remain fundamental determinants of the patterns of innovation, the demand structure plays a crucial role in preventing the emergence of concentration through a partially endogenous process of discovery of new submarkets. However, it is not simply market fragmentation as such that produces this result, but rather the entity of the ""prize"" that innovators can gain relative to the overall size of the market. Further, the model shows that emerging industry leaders are innovative early entrants in large submarkets.</p>"

<p>Incumbent firms, especially in high-tech industries, often contract and collaborate with small research units on single projects. A delicate resulting contracting decision thus is how to allocate control. This paper considers the incumbent's problem to design a research contract that specifies: the allocation of control; the unit's research input, and its monetary compensation. Contracting is complicated by the unit's private information about its technological skills; research outputs also are not verifiable. Control affects the distribution of the private benefits from research and can be shared. From a complete contract perspective, an allocation of control that is contingent on the unit's reported information provides the incumbent an additional instrument for designing the incentives. Control can generate countervailing incentives and mitigate the limitations of contracts in research environments, to the point of extracting the full surplus. The analysis further clarifies when control is centralized by the incumbent, when it is shared between the parties, and when it is delegated to the unit. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

<p>Governments worldwide are under pressure to reduce spending, and yet the demand for public services is generally increasing. Despite growing emphasis on and investment in technological innovation, little is known about innovation in public services. Research has shown that resistance to change, risk aversion, and organizational structures are major barriers to public-sector innovation. How to overcome such barriers is less clear. Recently, researchers have increased their focus on the importance of specific business models in facilitating collaboration between public-sector organizations and private-sector partners. In this paper, we present an emerging business model-commercialization partnership-and discuss two examples of technological innovations in the U.K. public sector using this model. Our findings demonstrate that successful technological innovation may depend more on the models for collaboration than on the specific technology involved. We conclude with a checklist to assist technology managers introducing innovations into public-sector organizations.</p>"

Moreover, the dominant custom of selecting godparents from among kinsmen is a recent development, based on historical data. A new survey about the selection of godparents in Italy and France, conducted for this study, shows that godparents are chosen not for religious, but for social-relational reasons. Selection of kinsmen is the norm, with uncles and aunts being the majority choice. For Italy, choice determinants are explored by means of multinomial regressions. The results are contrasted with demographic change to show that in lowest-low fertility countries current godparenthood models are bound to disappear.</p>"

<p>To translate the functional index for hand osteoarthritis (FIHOA) into Italian and to evaluate its reliability and validity in Italian patients with hand osteoarthritis (HOA).</p>
<p>The original French FIHOA was translated into Italian according to the guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation and then administered to 72 outpatients with HOA, together with the visual analogue scale of pain (VAS), the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Test-retest reliability was verified by having all patients fill out the Italian version of FIHOA again 1 week later. Item-item analysis was performed. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient were calculated to compare test and retest responses and to evaluate the degree of correlation. Internal consistency reliability was evaluated by Cronbach's alpha coefficient, and internal structure validity was appraised through factor analysis, also taking a varimax rotation into consideration. Construct validity was assessed by correlating FIHOA with other measures of functional impairment and pain using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.</p>
<p>Internal consistency was high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87). Test-retest reliability showed a Spearman's rho of 0.942 (p < 0.001). A significant correlation (p < 0.001) between FIHOA, VAS and HAQ and a significant negative correlation between FIHOA and SF-36 subscales were observed. FIHOA was confirmed to be a non-unidimensional scale, but in addition to the total score of the index, three subtotals of item scores were considered to provide better evaluations of finger functionality (items 3, 6, 8 and 10), wrist functionality (items 2 and 7) and hand strength (items 4 and 5) in single individuals.</p>

<p>There is increasing awareness that university-industry collaboration provides an important knowledge transfer channel and, thus, is a powerful driver of innovation. Universities are increasingly being asked to play incisive roles in the process of regional economic development. This paper assesses the extent to which university-industry collaboration, expressed in terms of private funding for university consulting research activities, is affected by the geographic proximity of an academic institution to an Industrial District (ID). Although the economic literature insists on the positive effects of proximity for these collaborations, empirical work on Italian ID so far shows no particular effects. This paper provides new insights into the effects of academic proximity to ID on university-industry collaboration, by presenting robust evidence that proximity to districts promotes the establishment of collaboration agreements. This sheds new light on the need for targeted policies to support local productive systems. The empirical evidence is based on an analysis of qualitative information and an econometric analysis of financial data for the whole population of Italian university departments engaged in research in the Engineering and Physical Sciences.

<p>Given the great potential of developing marketing campaigns delivered via mobile devices and the evolution of near-field communication technologies, this study examines factors influencing consumers' acceptance of untethered, or mobile, marketing across three influential markets: the United States, China, and Europe. We examine the extent to which the usefulness of mobile information/programs and individual characteristics-namely innovativeness, personal attachment, and risk avoidance-jointly influence attitudes toward mobile marketing, and how the latter influences consumers' mobile marketing activity across three large and influential markets. We found perceived usefulness, consumer innovativeness, and personal attachment to directly influence attitudes toward mobile marketing in all three markets. In China and Europe, risk avoidance also negatively influences attitudes toward mobile marketing. Marketers seeking to build and maintain customer relationships via mobile platforms should view these individual characteristics as levers brands can push to amplify consumers' acceptance of mobile marketing.

<p>Given the pervasive use of teams in organizations coupled with high levels of investment in collaboration technology, there is increasing interest in identifying factors that affect the exploration and use of a broader scope of system features so that firms can benefit from the use of such technology. Prior research has called for a deeper understanding of how managers can encourage greater innovation with technology in the workplace. Drawing on the team climate and technology use literatures, we identify team learning climate and team empowerment climate as key factors that affect employees' propensity to explore a new system's features. We develop and test our multilevel model on team climate, team technology exploration, and team technology use in a field study involving 268 employees embedded in 56 work teams. Three main findings come out of this research. First, the results reveal that the two types of team climate differ in their cross-level effects on individual intention to explore, such that team learning climate promotes greater intention to explore, whereas team empowerment climate reduces employees' intention to explore the technology. In addition, we find that team learning climate and team empowerment climate interact in shaping individual intention to explore, such that the presence of a strong learning climate is more effective in promoting intention to explore when teams also have a strong empowerment climate. Second, the findings show that men and women are affected differently by team climate. We find that for men, team empowerment climate has no influence on intention to explore, whereas for women there is a significant negative cross-level effect. Finally, we find that intention to explore has a positive effect on usage scope, suggesting an important link between team climate, individual cognition, and the scope of features used by employees in team settings. Taken together, the model and results highlight the important role of team climate and gender and the interplay between them as drivers of technology feature exploration. Our findings, especially those related to team empowerment climate, are counterintuitive when compared to prior literature and offer useful insights for managers. On the one hand, managers should consider leveraging team learning climate to intrinsically stimulate employees to engage in exploration of technology. On the other hand, managers should be cautious and guard against saddling employees with too many additional responsibilities during the stages of exploration and experimentation with system features. It is possible that through an expanded set of responsibilities and expectations fostered by team empowerment climate, employees may be experiencing work overload, thus reducing their likelihood of exploring a broader set of technology features. Managers should be especially attentive to this based on the gender composition of their teams.</p>"

<p>In this paper we analyze the role played by self-confidence, modeled as beliefs about one's ability, in shaping task choices. We propose a model in which fully rational agents exploit all the available information to update their beliefs using Bayes' rule, eventually learning their true type. We show that when the learning process does not converge quickly to the true ability level, small differences in initial confidence can result in diverging patterns of human capital accumulation between otherwise identical individuals. If differences in self-confidence are correlated with socio-economic background (as a large body of empirical literature suggests), self-confidence can be a channel through which education and earning inequalities perpetuate across generations. Our theory suggests that cognitive tests should take place as early as possible, in order to avoid that systematic differences in self-confidence among equally talented people lead to the emergence of gaps in the accumulation of human capital.

<p>Decision and policy-makers benefit from the utilization of computer codes in an increasing number of areas and applications. Several authorities and agencies recommend the utilization of proper sensitivity analysis methods in order to confidently entrust model results. In this respect, density-based techniques have recently attracted interest among academicians and practitioners, for their property to characterize uncertainty in terms of the entire distribution of an output variable. However, their estimation is a challenging task and, without a proper methodical approach, errors in the estimates can lead to misleading conclusions. In this work, we propose sampling plans for reducing the computational burden of sensitivity estimates while improving and controlling the accuracy in the estimation. We compare designs based on column substitutions and designs based on permutations. We investigate their behaviour in terms of type I and type II errors. We apply the methods to the Level E model, a computational tool developed by the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD for the assessment of nuclear waste disposal sites. Results show that application of the proposed sampling plans allows one to obtain confidence in the sensitivity estimates at a number of model runs several orders of magnitude lower than a brute-force approach. This assessment, based upon the entire distribution of the model output, provides us with ways to effectively reduce uncertainty in the model output, either by prioritizing the model factors that need to be better known or by prioritizing the areas where additional modelling efforts are needed.

<p>This study updates the debate on the sources of innovation. Using techniques like factor analysis, multidimensional scaling, and pathfinder analysis, we examine the most influential articles that have dealt with the topic. Our analysis provides three main findings. The first more precisely highlights the role of demand as a source of innovation. The second illustrates how competences enable firms to match technology with demand and capitalize on technology and demand as sources of innovation. The third unveils a distinction between external and internal sources of innovations. The sources of innovation can be purely external or internally generated competences that enable the firm to integrate external knowledge within its boundaries. Our work contributes to the classic debate by providing a more granular understanding of how technology and demand interact. In discussing our findings, we link our framework to strategy, innovation and entrepreneurship studies that expressly call for a better understanding of technology and demand factors in value creation and capture.

We show that the posterior distribution of phi is inconsistent in the frequentist sense.

To solve this problem, we construct a regularized posterior distribution, based on a Tikhonov regularization of the inverse of the marginal variance of the sample, which is justified by a penalized projection argument. This regularized posterior distribution is consistent in the frequentist sense and its mean can be interpreted as the mean of the exact posterior distribution resulting from a Gaussian prior distribution with a shrinking covariance operator.(C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

<p>After a long period of stagnation, traditionally explained by the voluntary nature of the programme, a considerable increase in routine measles vaccine uptake has been recently observed in Italy after a set of public interventions aiming to promote MMR immunization, whilst retaining its voluntary aspect. To account for this take-off in coverage we propose a simple SIR transmission model with vaccination choice, where, unlike similar works, vaccinating behaviour spreads not only through the diffusion of ""private'' information spontaneously circulating among parents of children to be vaccinated, which we call imitation, but also through public information communicated by the public health authorities. We show that public intervention has a stabilising role which is able to reduce the strength of imitation-induced oscillations, to allow disease elimination, and to even make the disease-free equilibrium where everyone is vaccinated globally attractive. The available Italian data are used to evaluate the main behavioural parameters, showing that the proposed model seems to provide a much more plausible behavioural explanation of the observed take-off of uptake of vaccine against measles than models based on pure imitation alone.</p>"

<p>Political consumerism has become one of the most promising research fields in social movement and political participation studies. However, most research has focused mainly on the more personalized and less collective version of such forms of action, leaving largely unexplored the nature and dynamic of some new local grassroots organizations (such as the so-called Gruppi di Acquisto Solidale, or Solidarity Purchasing Groups [SPGs] in Italy). The influence of such forms of political participation in contemporary democracies has been scarcely investigated. The aim of this article is to provide an in-depth exploratory case study of SPGs in Italy, which more specifically focuses on the main definitional, organizational, and sociodemographic features of SPG participation. The article shows that the Italian SPGs are locally based hybrid pressure movements that go beyond conventional forms of political consumerism by adopting innovative organizational and participatory tools.</p>"

In particular, we focus on the use of these techniques as devices to obtain classes of individual life course trajectories. We first compare the consistency of the classification that is obtained via the two techniques by using a data set on the life course trajectories of young adults. Then, we adopt a simulation approach to measure the ability of these two methods to classify groups of life course trajectories correctly when specific forms of random variability are introduced within prespecified classes in an artificial data set. To do so, we introduce simulation operators that have a life course and/or observational meaning. Our results contribute on the one hand to outline the usefulness and robustness of findings based on the classification of life course trajectories through latent class analysis and sequence analysis and on the other hand to illuminate the potential pitfalls in applications of these techniques.</p>"

<p>This paper investigates the price-setting behavior of full-service airlines in the European passenger aviation market. We develop a model of airline competition, which accommodates various market structures, some of which include low-cost players. Using data on published airfares of Lufthansa, British Airways, Alitalia and KLM for the main city-pairs from Italy to the rest of Europe, our empirical findings substantially confirm the propositions of the theoretical model. We find that competition among full-service carriers appears to affect the price levels of the business and the leisure segments asymmetrically: there are small reductions in the leisure segments and significant reductions in the business segment of the aviation market. In contrast, competition with low-cost carriers reduces both the business and leisure fares of full-service carriers quite uniformly, with an emphasis on the mid-segment fares. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>This article extends the discussion on the 'dark side' of social capital in sport which has recently been increasingly conceptualized in civil society studies. We define the dark side of social capital as situations in which trust, social ties and shared beliefs and norms that may be beneficial to some persons are detrimental to other individuals, sport movements, or for society at large. Furthermore, we understand the dark side of social capital as attempts to manipulate and misuse trust to achieve a particular interest. We argue that the majority of studies using the notion of the dark side have investigated primarily sport practice rather than sport governance and have focused on either the macro- or micro-level, neglecting the meso-level. Additionally, previous studies have focused primarily on the exclusive role of bonding social networks at the expense of linking social capital and manipulation of trust. To contribute to reducing these gaps, our analysis draws on evidence gathered during a multi-sited ethnographic study of Czech and Italian sport associations governing football, handball and sailing.</p>"

<p>The term virtual water refers to the volume of water used in the production of a commodity or service. Accordingly, virtual water 'trade' is the amount of water 'embedded' in commodities being transferred from one place to another as a consequence of trade. This paper argues that the conventional methods so far adopted for the computation of virtual water 'flows' (based on Hoekstra and Hung 2002) have considered only direct water usage and not sufficiently distinguished between blue and green water resources. This has brought about flawed estimates of virtual water 'flows', thereby limiting the usefulness of the virtual water concept as a tool for informing water policy. A novel approach for computing virtual water 'flows' which applies the Input-output (IO) methodology to account for both direct and indirect water consumption, and simultaneously distinguishes between the different typologies of water, is presented. The study upholds that the integration of these two methods can not only provide a more robust framework for quantifying virtual water 'flows', but also enhance the relevance of the concept as a tool for water resource management policy. The implications of these alternative estimation methods are here illustrated using data referring to 11 Mediterranean economies and 7 internationally traded agricultural commodities.</p>"

<p>Given the ubiquity of emotional experiences and the importance of similarity for understanding cognition and behavior, we examined how emotional valence affects perceived similarity. We hypothesized an affective projection process, whereby the emotion evoked by a prime is projected onto and influences judgments of unrelated targets. Experiment 1 revealed that positive events were judged more likely after a positive prime (""respected"") than after a negative prime (""rejected""), thus demonstrating affective projection, whereas negative events were judged equally likely regardless of prime valence. Across five further experiments, positive primes increased similarity ratings of unrelated social categories (musicians & dentists), animals (penguins & horses), and animal-like novel figures (greebles). In contrast, because emotions cannot be projected onto inanimate objects, judgments of artifacts (saws & spoons) and artifact-like figures (yadgits) were unaffected. The influence of prime valence on target judgment was asymmetric, with positive primes affecting similarity but negative primes having no effect.</p>"

<p>We study the behavioural foundation of interdependent preferences, where the outcomes of others affect the welfare of the decision maker. These preferences are taken as given, not derived from more primitive ones. Our aim is to establish an axiomatic foundation providing the link between observation of choices and a functional representation which is convenient, free of inconsistencies and can provide the basis for measurement. The dependence among preferences may take place in two conceptually different ways, expressing two different views of the nature of interdependent preferences. The first is Festinger's view that the evaluation of peers' outcomes is useful to improve individual choices by learning from the comparison. The second is Veblen's view that interdependent preferences keep track of social status derived from a social value attributed to the goods one consumes. Corresponding to these two different views, we have two different formulations. In the first, the decision maker values his outcomes and those of others on the basis of his own utility. In the second, he ranks outcomes according to a social value function. We give different axiomatic foundations to these two different, but complementary, views of the nature of the interdependence. On the basis of this axiomatic foundation, we build a behavioural theory of comparative statics within subjects and across subjects. We characterize preferences according to the relative importance assigned to gains and losses in social domain, that is pride and envy. This parallels the standard analysis of private gains and losses (as well as that of regret and relief). We give an axiomatic foundation of interpersonal comparison of preferences, ordering individuals according to their sensitivity to social ranking. These characterizations provide the behavioural foundation for applied analysis of market and game equilibria with interdependent preferences.</p>"

<p>Green public procurement (GPP) is becoming a cornerstone of environmental policies both at European Union and Member State levels. Drawing upon a database of public authorities located in three Italian regions, this paper assesses the determinants and drawbacks of green procurement adoption. In particular, using an econometrical approach we tested the following propositions: (i) the existing awareness on GPP practices, tools and regulations does support public authorities to develop GPP strategies; (ii) the support of external experts in purchasing function does support public authorities to develop GPP practices; (iii) the small dimension of public authority is an obstacle to adopting GPP practices; (iv) ISO 14001 certified public authorities are more likely to develop GPP practices. The econometric analysis shows that the dimension of public authorities and the level of awareness of the existing tools for supporting GPP have a positive and significant effect on the probability that they adopt GPP practices.

<p>Background: Documented age, gender, race and socio-economic disparities in total joint arthroplasty (TJA), suggest that those who need the surgery may not receive it, and present a challenge to explain the causes of unmet need. It is not clear whether doctors limit treatment opportunities to patients, nor is it known the effect that patient beliefs and expectations about the operation, including their paid work status and retirement plans, have on the decision to undergo TJA. Identifying socio-economic and other determinants of demand would inform the design of effective and efficient health policy. This review was conducted to identify the factors that lead patients in need to undergo TJA.</p>
<p>Methods: An electronic search of the Embase and Medline (Ovid) bibliographic databases conducted in September 2011 identified studies in the English language that reported on factors driving patients in need of hip or knee replacement to undergo surgery. The review included reports of elective surgery rates in eligible patients or, controlling for disease severity, in general subjects, and stated clinical experts' and patients' opinions on suitability for or willingness to undergo TJA. Quantitative and qualitative studies were reviewed, but quantitative studies involving fewer than 20 subjects were excluded. The quality of individual studies was assessed on the basis of study design (i.e., prospective versus retrospective), reporting of attrition, adjustment for and report of confounding effects, and reported measures of need (self-reported versus doctor-assessed). Reported estimates of effect on the probability of surgery from analyses adjusting for confounders were summarised in narrative form and synthesised in odds ratio (OR) forest plots for individual determinants.</p>
<p>Results: The review included 26 quantitative studies-23 on individuals' decisions or views on having the operation and three about health professionals' opinions-and 10 qualitative studies. Ethnic and racial disparities in TJA use are associated with socio-economic access factors and expectations about the process and outcomes of surgery. In the United States, health insurance coverage affects demand, including that from the Medicare population, for whom having supplemental Medicaid coverage increases the likelihood of undergoing TJA. Patients with post-secondary education are more likely to demand hip or knee surgery than those without it (range of OR 0.87-2.38). Women are as willing to undergo surgery as men, but they are less likely to be offered surgery by specialists than men with the same need. There is considerable variation in patient demand with age, with distinct patterns for hip and knee. Paid employment appears to increase the chances of undergoing surgery, but no study was found that investigated the relationship between retirement plans and demand for TJA. There is evidence of substantial geographical variation in access to joint replacement within the territory"

<p>Following the debate on the role of credit risk transfer (CRT) in exacerbating the 2007-2009 crisis, this paper investigates the usage and effects of loan sales, securitization, and credit derivatives in U.S. commercial banks over the last decade, with special emphasis on the financial crisis. We find that in times of severe funding constraints, the need to raise financial resources becomes the principal incentive behind CRT. We document some beneficial effects of CRT on the economy, since the funds released through CRT are subsequently invested by banks to sustain credit supply, also in recession. However, we report higher overall riskiness in banks that engage intensively in loans sales and securitization, which translates into higher default rates during the crisis. Interestingly, the benefits and drawbacks of CRT are much stronger for loan sales and securitization than for credit derivatives. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This article addresses definitory problems concerning participatory budgeting (PB), the purpose being to underline the governance nature of this instrument. More specifically, considering PB as a particular type of participatory governance arrangement, it focuses on the democratic outcomes of concrete experiences. Adopting the Dahlian process-oriented concept of democracy, three Italian cases are depicted and analysed, according to four critical variables: inclusion, participation, the role of the opposition, and transparency. This enables full description of how PB affects local democracy, both positively and negatively. The article concludes by highlighting two variables that give account of the democratic implications of these practices: the role of the political leadership, and the inclusive strategy adopted. Further, it underlines three additional factors that embody what is commonly referred to as political investment in publicprivate partnerships: an active role for the opposition, outward communication, and effective participation. While assessing the democratic outcomes, the study highlights how the presence and maintenance of these practices are linked to the role played by civil society and the presence of administrative ties.</p>"

Findings show that humor appeals are less effective than fear and shock appeals, evidencing the failures in HIV/AIDS prevention campaigns in Italy, a country where the former communication strategy has been used in substantive ways.

<p>While family business research has prominently recognized that family firms are motivated by nonfinancial factors, the literature has remained relatively silent about whether or not these firms are more likely than others to engage actively with their stakeholders, who often have nonpecuniary demands. This paper argues that family firms are more prone to adopt proactive stakeholder engagement (PSE) activities because by doing so they preserve and enhance their socioemotional wealth (SEW). We explore the impact of the different dimensions of SEW on PSE and identify distinctive logics that explain the adoption of such practices. Finally, we offer a set of topics for future studies.</p>"

<p>Over the last decades the process of modernization in the public sector has fostered the adoption of new accounting techniques, such as accrual accounting and non-financial performance measurement systems. The purpose of this paper is to test hypotheses on the different perceptions of politicians and managers as to the importance of performance information. Our findings suggest that politicians' and managers' views on the importance of performance information are more similar than expected. They also show that accounting innovations are in some cases embraced with enthusiasm (non-financial performance), whereas in other cases they are hardly recognized (e. g. accrual accounting).</p>"

Controlling for effects due to the legal system prevailing in each country, we find strong evidence that this factor plays an important role in explaining cross-sectional variance. This result conveys important normative implications: entrepreneurship and innovation benefit significantly from an active VC industry, which also allows the ignition of virtuous cycles. Activating this cycle, though, relies on some socioeconomic prerequisites that government and institutions should primarily address.</p>"

Then, we use instrumental variables based on immigration toward destination countries other than Italy to identify the causal impact of exogenous changes in Italys immigrant population. According to these estimates, immigration increases only the incidence of robberies, while leaving unaffected all other types of crime. Since robberies represent a very minor fraction of all criminal offenses, the effect on the overall crime rate is not significantly different from zero.</p>"

<p>This article examines the effect of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) on the profile of merging firms' inventive activity. The authors conceive of the inventive process as a recombinant search, whose outcome can be characterized along two complementary dimensions, which define its profile: its depth of impact on subsequent inventions, and its breadth of impact across different scientific domains. The profile of firms' inventive activity depends on two main factors: the resources available to be recombined and the organizational incentives that guide the recombination process. In turn, these factors significantly depend on the upstream, technological resources available and on firms' downstream, product-market related assets. Importantly, both of these factors may change in the aftermath of M&A, as their specific institutional features facilitate the exchange and redeployment of upstream and downstream resources. The authors then discuss how variations in the profile of firms' inventive activity in the aftermath of an M&A reflect the diversity of upstream and downstream resources redeployed by the M&A deal. They test their hypotheses with a panel of firms from the US medical devices and photographic equipment industry. The study finds that diversity in merging firms' downstream resources exerts a positive impact on post-acquisition profile of inventive activities, whereas diversity in knowledge bases does not seem to exert a significant direct effect on the two qualitative dimensions of inventive activity considered. Yet, technological diversity displays a positive effect in deals characterized by high market relatedness.</p>"

<p>Purpose - The issue of accounting change, why and how accounting evolves through time and within specific organisational settings, has been addressed by an important body of literature. This paper aims to explain why, in processes of accounting change, organisations confronting similar environmental pressures show different outcomes of change.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on archetype theory, the paper analyses the case of two Italian local governments. Comparative case studies were carried out, reconstructing a period of 15 years.</p>
<p>Findings - Although confronted with similar environmental pressures, the two cases show two different patterns of accounting change, where only one case is able to finally reach radical change. Accounting change can be prompted by external stimuli, but, once the change is prompted, the outcomes of the change are explained by the dynamics of intra-organisational conditions.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The study contributes to accounting change literature by adopting an approach (i.e. archetype theory) that overcomes some of the limitations of previous studies in explaining variations in organisational change. Through this, the authors are able to explain different outcomes and paces of accounting change and point out the intra-organisational factors also affecting them in the presence of similar environmental pressures. A specification of the theoretical framework in a particular setting is also provided.</p>"

<p>We find a robust negative correlation between Italian firms productivity and their export share to low-income destinations. To account for this surprising fact, we marry Verhoogen (2008) with Eaton (2011), by introducing firm heterogeneity in product quality and country heterogeneity in quality consumption in a framework featuring firm and market-specific shocks in entry costs and demand, and estimate the model's parameters structurally by the simulated method of moments. The estimated preference for quality turns out to be monotonically increasing in foreign destinations income. The model also predicts a negative correlation between firms R&D intensity and their export share to low-income destinations, a finding supported by our data. Overall, our results strongly suggest high-quality firms should concentrate their sales in high-income markets.</p>"

An important innovation is that we take into account siblings' fertility behavior and share of grandparents' time in terms of childcare. We show that availability of grandparents plays an important role in individuals' decision of having children. Being helped by grandparents increases the chance of childbearing when existing grandchildren are not too young. On the other hand, the probability of having a child is lower when grandparents are already looking after a sibling's young child. The role of grandparenting appears stronger in the South of Europe, where public childcare for young children is less prevalent.</p>"

By forming business groups and focused companies, the two nations came up with their own viable alternatives to the dominant paradigm that originated in the United States and spread among the bigger European economies.</p>"

This article describes the pattern of public sector demand for leases in Italy. While leasing is widely regarded as a model with the potential to create economic value, demand for leases is mainly driven by accounting considerations. The authors suggest that the operating lease model may, if properly structured, offer the cost-certainty benefits associated with concession-based public-private partnership (PPP) contracts, but with lower transaction and financial costs. These findings have significant implications for procurement policy in Europe, where PPPs are being promoted by the EC and the governments of many member states.</p>"

<p>This paper reports evidence from a survey, aimed at testing whether and how Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), which enable the adoption of product-service systems, can contribute to value creation. This analysis builds on previous contributions, according to which companies that are enriching their product offering through value-added services (the so-called servitisation strategy) often report lower levels of profitability, owing to the poor performance of their operating process. A wide stream of research claims that companies that invest in ICTs can enjoy valuable outcomes, since the adoption of such technologies results in processes that are more efficient and more responsive. Our hypothesis concerns the possibility of leveraging ICTs at operating process level so as to pursue a servitisation strategy. The in-field analysis presented in this paper concerns a sample of 109 companies located in Italy; data collected through the survey have been analysed using the structural equation modelling approach. The evidence presented demonstrates that ICTs can have a relevant impact on value creation because they lead to superior responsiveness of operating processes and to sound improvements in the product offering. In particular, companies that are able to embed such superior responsiveness into their product offering can further boost value creation.</p>"

This effect is primarily driven by the fact that the federal government penalizes municipalities run by mayors from the opposition coalition who won by a narrow margin, thereby tying their hands for the next election.</p>"

A two-round Delphi panels in combination with Carroll diagram was used to generate consensus in the selection of the 10 RDs among the project participants.</p>
<p>Results: The two Delphi rounds yielded a prioritised list, to which the Carroll diagram was applied, taking into account three determinants: prevalence, availability of effective treatment and need for carer. The final set of RD to be studied was obtained: cystic fibrosis, Prader-Willi syndrome, haemophilia, duchenne muscular dystrophy, epidermolysis bullosa, fragile X syndrome, scleroderma, mucopolysaccharidosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and histiocytosis.

We analyze the consequences of a major Norwegian workfare reform of the generous welfare system for lone mothers. The reform imposed work requirements and time limits on welfare receipt, while raising in-work benefits. Our difference-in-differences estimates show that the reform was successful in improving labor-market participation and in increasing the earnings of lone mothers.

<p>Background: Over the past few decades, in OECD countries there has been a general growing trend in the prevalence of out-of-hospital healthcare services, but there is a general lack of data on the use of these services.</p>
<p>Methods: We defined a list of 303 indicators related to primary and community healthcare services in collaboration with 13 Italian Local Health Authorities (LHAs). Then, for each LHA, we collected and analyzed these indicators for two different years (2003 and 2007).</p>
<p>Results: Out-of-hospital care absorbs 56% of all costs in our sample of LHAs. Expenditure on outpatients' visits to specialists and on diagnostic examinations accounts for 13% of the costs, while spending on primary care (including prevention and public health) accounts for 9%, and for intermediate structures (including those related to rehabilitation, elderly people, disabled people, and mental health) the figure is 11%. Different Italian LHAs have made different strategic choices with respect to primary and community-based care (PCC).</p>
<p>Conclusions: Two distinct strategic orientations in the adoption of PCC services by LHAs has emerged from our study. The first has been an investment mainly in ambulatory and home-based primary care services in order to increase the number of low-complexity settings. A second strategy has prioritized the allocation of resources to intermediate inpatient structures for specific types of patients, namely elderly and disabled people, post-acute patients in need of rehabilitation and long-term care, and patients in hospices.</p>"

<p>This interview-based study of three design-oriented KIBS firms proposes a U-shaped project-stage model of co-production intensity in firms offering knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) requiring a high level of creativity. During the central stage of project execution the creative KIBS firms typically know what needs to be accomplished but do not know what specific path should be pursued to accomplish the task. An intense phase of idea generation and narrowing down of possibilities generally follows the signing of the contract. Interviewees at design-oriented KIBS firms seldom mentioned the client as playing a significant role during the creative phase of the project. The study suggests that, under certain circumstances, both KIBS providers and clients might desire to regulate the level of co-production, and that at certain project stages a reduced level might actually improve the quality of the final output. Other contingencies are also developed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

To explore this issue, a case-based analysis was conducted on six companies from the food distribution and pharmaceutical industries. The empirical analysis shows that this assumption holds when the companies deal with a very high number of SKUs; they need to properly manage warehousing processes to guarantee fast, complete and correct deliveries to customers. This results in the adoption of best practices and in relevant investments in technology and equipment peculiar to warehousing. This empirical analysis also shows that, to further improve the accuracy and the speed of the picking and shipping processes, the companies tend to automate their activities, but only when the level of order fragmentation is low and the degree of morphological homogeneity is high.</p>"

We develop a model of the provision of incentives to corporate scientists, in an environment where (1) scientists engage in multiple activities when performing research; (2) knowledge is not perfectly appropriable; (3) scientists are responsive to both monetary and non-monetary incentives; and (4) firms compete on the product market. We show that both knowledge spillovers and market competition affect the incentives given to scientists, and these effects interact. First, high knowledge spillovers lead firms to soften incentives when product market competition is high, and to strengthen incentives when competition is low. Second, the relationship between the intensity of competition and the power of incentives is U-shaped, with the exact shape depending on the degree of knowledge spillovers. We also show that the performance-contingent pay for both applied and basic research increases with the non-pecuniary benefits that scientists obtain from research, while the fixed component decreases. We relate our findings to the existing empirical evidence, and also discuss their implications for management and public policy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This paper aims to further the alignment among different theoretical approaches and future scholarship on the complex themes related to the micro-foundational processes characterizing the emergence and development of organizational routines and capabilities. It has been constructed with a typical Hegelian structure represented by a thesis, an antithesis and an attempt of a synthesis, each presented by different scholars, primed by a common set of questions related to the role of individual actors in shaping organizational change processes. The dialogue is introduced by Koen Heimeriks, followed by Sidney Winter proposing the thesis for an evolutionary perspective on the problem, and an antithesis is offered by Nicolai Foss with a number of critical points made from different economics and social science perspectives. Finally, Maurizio Zollo offers an attempt of a synthesis between the two positions with some proposals for conceptual and empirical advancement. The dialogue points to a convergence on the usefulness of evolutionary theory as a theoretical lens, but also on the need to add to the central notion of routinized behavior, other stable organizational traits of evolutionary relevance, such as the cognitive, motivational and identity-based antecedents to behavior, as well as key dimensions of intentionality and consciousness of change, which have been so far given either implicit or axiomatic roles. An overarching model of firm evolution that includes these micro-level factors in the context of more collective-level dynamics might help forging collaborative work across different schools of thought, as well as bridging the two levels of analysis in a way that is both theoretically well-grounded and empirically testable.</p>"

<p>Recent studies have stressed the role played by global pipelines in fostering the growth of clusters and innovativeness. In this article, we develop a formal model to investigate when global pipelines contribute to an increase in local knowledge, depending on various characteristics of clusters such as size, knowledge endowment, and the ease of transmission of internal knowledge. This model is an extension of Cowan and Jonard's () model in which we introduce the concept of cluster and a role for spatial proximity in the diffusion of knowledge. Our results reveal that there is a natural tendency of actors within global pipelines to act as external stars, rather than gatekeepers of knowledge. Global pipelines are beneficial for the accumulation of knowledge only if the cluster is either characterized by a high-quality local buzz or is small and weakly endowed in terms of knowledge.</p>"

<p>This paper studies how firm heterogeneity in terms of productivity affects the balance between agglomeration and dispersion forces in the presence of pecuniary externalities through a selection model of monopolistic competition with endogenous markups. It shows that firm heterogeneity matters. However, whether it shifts the balance from agglomeration to dispersion or the other way round depends on its specific features along the two defining dimensions of diversity: 'richness' and 'evenness'. Accordingly, the role of firm heterogeneity in selection models of agglomeration can not be fully understood without paying due attention to various moments of the underlying firm productivity distribution.

<p>This paper describes financial systemic risk as a pollution issue. Free riding leads to excess risk production. This problem may be solved, at least partially, either by financial regulation or by taxation. From a normative viewpoint, taxation is superior in many respects. However, reality shows that financial regulation is adopted more frequently. This paper makes a positive, politico-economic argument. If the majority chooses regulation, the level is likely to be too harsh. If it chooses taxation, then the level is likely to be too low. Due to regressive effects, a tax on financial transactions receives low support from a majority of low polluting portfolio owners. The same kind of majority may strategically choose regulation in order to burden the minority with a larger share of the cost of reducing systemic risk. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

<p>To what extent do organizations respond favorably to minority participation-that is, conform to demands from minority resource suppliers that hold an unconventional logic? A favorable response to minority participation (i.e., ""alternative conformity"") helps decrease the influence of dominant players, alter the resource suppliers' social structure, and promote new logics, which makes alternative conformity a ""soft control strategy"" for organizations. We expect a positive relationship between minority participation and alternative conformity and expect that relationship to be attenuated by organizations' adherence to a dominant logic, the centrality of minority logic holders, and a minority logic's institutional credit. We test and find strong support for our hypotheses using original data on investment funds in the French film industry (1994-2008).</p>"

<p>Background: The aim of this study was to estimate the one-year societal costs due to a stroke event in Italy and to investigate variables associated with costs in different phases following hospital admission.</p>
<p>Methods: The patients were enrolled in 44 hospitals across the country and data on socio-demographic, clinical variables and resource consumption were prospectively surveyed for 411 stroke survivors at admission, discharge and 3, 6 and 12 months post the event. We adopted a micro-costing procedure to identify cost generating components and the attribution of appropriate unit costs for three cost categories: direct healthcare, direct non-healthcare (including informal care costs) and productivity losses. The relation between costs of stroke management and socio-demographic and clinical characteristics as well as disability levels was evaluated in a series of bivariate analyses using non parametric tests (Mann Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis). Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of costs incurred by stroke patients during the acute phase and follow-up of 1 year.</p>
<p>Results: On average, one-year healthcare and societal costs amounted to (sic)11,747 and (sic) 19,953 per stroke survivor, respectively. The major cost component of societal costs was informal care accounting for (sic) 6,656 (33.4% of total), followed by the initial hospitalisation, ((sic) 5,573; 27.9% of total), rehabilitation during follow up ((sic) 4,112; 20.6 %), readmissions ((sic) 439) and specialist and general practioner visits ((sic) 326). Mean drug costs per patient over the follow-up period was about (sic) 50 per month. Costs associated to the provision of paid and informal care followed different pattern and were persistent over time (ranging from (sic) 639 to (sic) 597 per month in the first and the second part of the year, respectively). Clinical variables (presence of diabetes mellitus and hemorrhagic stroke) were significant predictors of total healthcare costs while functional outcomes (Barthel Index and Modified Ranking Scale scores) were significantly associated with both healthcare and societal costs at one year.</p>
<p>Conclusions: The significant role of informal care in stroke management and different distribution of costs over time suggest that appropriate planning should look at both incident and prevalent stroke cases to forecast health infrastructure needs and more importantly, to assure that stroke patients have adequate ""social"" support.</p>"

<p>How relevant is innovation by demand compared to innovation by other actors in a sector? In quantitative terms, this is a yet unanswered question. The current study fills this major gap in the literature on industry studies. By taking a sectoral system perspective, this study is able to highlight the magnitude of innovation by intermediate user firms in a high technology sector: semiconductors. Using a combination of different datasets - patents, co-patents, R&D alliances and new ventures in semiconductors - this study proposes a novel quantitative approach to assessing the magnitude of innovative activity by user firms. The study reaches several findings. First, the magnitude of innovation by user firms, as measured by patents, is high in both absolute and relative terms compared to semiconductor firms and other actors in the sector. Second, the distribution of patents among different demand segments is highly uneven. Third, innovative user firms are highly heterogeneous in terms of size, diversification and vertical integration. Fourth, collaboration in R&D and co-patenting activity in semiconductors take place not just between user firms and semiconductor firms, but also among user firms themselves. Fifth, innovative user firms are quite active in entrepreneurial activity in semiconductors and their new ventures, on average, survive longer than spin-offs or other start-ups.

<p>This paper investigates the effects of Buddhist ethics on consumers' materialism, that is, the propensity to attach a fundamental role to possessions. The literature shows that religion and religiosity influence various attitudes and behaviors of consumers, including their ethical beliefs and ethical decisions. However, most studies focus on general religiosity rather than on the specific doctrinal ethical tenets of religions. The current research focuses on Buddhism and argues that it can tame materialism directly, similar to other religions, and through the specific Buddhist ethical doctrines of the Four Immeasurables: compassion, loving kindness, empathetic joy, and equanimity. The empirical results show the following: (1) Buddhism reduces materialism directly and through some of the Four Immeasurables, and (2) despite the doctrine of non-existence of the self, positive emotions toward the self are still present, and the self absorbs the effects of Buddhist ethics on materialism. The latter finding suggests a ""resistance of the self"" that is coherent with the idea of a consumer who leverages the self to go beyond it.</p>"

We find that, before the Act, academic institutions had a strong tendency to leave such IPRs in the hands of their main funders, namely public research organizations (such as CNRS or INSERM), and business companies. After the introduction of the Act, French academic institutions increased their propensity to claim IPRs over their employees' inventions, mainly under the form of co-ownership with business companies. This result varies with the technological class of the patent, the presence and age of a technology transfer office within the university, and the university size and type.</p>"

<p>Objective: The Italian National Healthcare System (NHS) is one of the most decentralised systems since the devolution reform approved in 2001. HTA is spreading as an important tool for decision-making processes both at central and local levels. The aims of this study were to review the state of the health technology assessment (HTA) programmes in Italy - with a focus on regional and central initiatives - and to discuss consequences of a multi-level structure of HTA agencies in highly regionalised healthcare systems.</p>
<p>Methods: Our method combined documentary review with interviews. We reviewed scientific literature about HTA's activities in decentralised systems, legislative and administrative documents from national as well as regional authorities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 key individuals associated with HTA both at the national and regional levels. Data on HTA programmes implemented or under development in nine regions were collected and analysed according to key principles for the improved conduct of health technology assessments for resource allocation decisions.</p>
<p>Results: HTA is in the early stage of development in Italy, although with great heterogeneity across regions. The National Agency for Health Services has certainly contributed to HTA diffusion through supporting and training activities. However, the multi-level structure of HTA in Italy has not yet provided full coordination and harmonisation of practices and outcomes across the country, with a consequent exacerbate inequality of access to services and technologies.</p>
<p>Conclusions: There is probably need to rethink the multi-layer organizational framework of HTA in Italy by leveraging on current knowledge and efficient redistribution of activities across regions. We would advise for different jurisdictions playing different roles while achieving similar health outcomes for their patients, rather than jurisdictions aiming at doing exactly the same things resulting in unequal access to healthcare service provision.

<p>The last decades are being characterized by global trends such as population growth, aging, escalation of non communicable diseases and technological innovation. These unprecedented changes are moving faster than economic growth and threaten universal health coverage. What is at stake nowadays is governments' and healthcare systems' ability to renovate themselves and develop new paradigms aimed at finding innovative solutions to manage the new global forces so to maintain universal access to care in a changing environment. We have to be imaginative because if we keep relying on current paradigms to answer already too far-ahead complex problems, we will fail. And here education has a role to play. Although the recent years have seen a steep increase in the offerings of post-graduate management education programs in health and healthcare, the majority of these programs are still traditionally conceived and designed, aiming to train students to deal with specific, domestic, current problems. With the promise of making students the best specialists on Earth, to get the highest return on his or her investment in education, the performance of these programs is often measured in terms of earnings maximization. Although an indicator of success, this often incentivizes individuals to be context-based, individualistic, short-sighted and self-focused. Education has the greatest potential to foster imagination, to leverage diversity, to exploit team-working and free creative thinking. Education can substantially contribute to anticipate the impact of global forces by but an endeavor is needed to design programs and measures performances differently.

<p>Providing universal access to innovative, high-cost technologies leads to tensions in today's health care systems. The tension becomes particularly evident in the context of scarce resources, where the risk of taking contentious coverage decisions increases rapidly. To ensure economic sustainability, the payers of health care think that the benefits from the use of the new technologies need to be commensurate with the costs. Therefore, many jurisdictions have programs of health technology assessment, which often results in restrictions of access to care, either through complete refusal to reimburse the technology or its restriction of use to only a subset of the eligible patient population. However, manufacturers feel that they should be adequately rewarded for their innovations and require sufficient funds to invest in further research. Finally, patients perceive these technologies to have added benefits, and so they are concerned when they are denied access. If sustainable access to health care is to be maintained in the future, approaches are needed to reconcile these different perspectives. This article explores the approaches, in both methods and policy, to help bring about this reconciliation. These include rethinking the notion of social value (on the part of payers), aligning manufacturers' research more closely with societal objectives, and increasing patient participation in health technology assessment.

<p>In the context of reemerging universalistic approaches to health care, the objective of this article was to contribute to the discussion by highlighting the potential influence of global trade liberalization on the balance between health demand and the capacity of health systems pursuing universal health coverage (UHC) to supply adequate health care. Being identified as a defining feature of globalization affecting health, trade liberalization is analyzed as a complex and multidimensional influence on the implementation of UHC. The analysis adopts a systems-thinking approach and refers to the six building blocks of World Health Organizations current framework for action, emphasizing their interconnectedness.</p>
<p>While offering new opportunities to increase access to health information and care, in the absence of global governance mechanisms ensuring adequate health protection and promotion, global trade tends to have negative effects on health systems capacity to ensure UHC, both by causing higher demand and by interfering with the interconnected functioning of health systems building blocks. The prevention of such an impact and the effective implementation of UHC would highly benefit from a more consistent commitment and stronger leadership by the World Health Organization in protecting health in global policymaking fora in all sectors.

<p>In this article, we use cultural theory to investigate the nature of health systems governance and management, showing that it may be helpful in identifying key aspects of the debate about how to promote universal health coverage. Cultural theory argues that ""how"" we govern and manage health services depends on what we think about the nature of government organizations and the legitimacy of their scope of action. The values that are implied by universal health coverage underlie choices about ""how"" health systems are governed and their organizations are managed. We draw two main conclusions. First, the translation of principles and goals into practice requires exceptional efforts to design adequate decision-making arrangements (the essence of governance) and management practices. Management and governance, or ""how"" policies are decided and conducted, are not secondary to the selection of the best policy solutions (the ""what""). Second, governance and management solutions are not independent of the values that they are expected to serve. Instead, they should be designed to be consonant with these values. Cultural theory suggests-and experience supports-the idea that ""group identity"" is favorable for shaping different forms of social life and public administrations. This approach should thus be a starting point for those who strive to obtain universal health coverage. Copyright (C) 2013 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

<p>The sustainability of health care systems, particularly those supporting universal health care, is a matter of current discussion among policymakers and scholars. In this article, we summarize the controversies around the economic sustainability of health care. We attempt to extend the debate by including a more comprehensive conceptualization of sustainability in relation to health care systems and by examining the dimensions of social and political sustainability. In conclusion, we argue that policymakers when taking decisions around universal health care should carefully consider issues of social, political, and economic sustainability, their interaction, and often their inherent trade-offs.</p>"

<p>Recent studies have highlighted the importance of management in the health care sector. Positive correlations have been found between clinical and economic performance. Although there is still controversy regarding what kind of management and which managers should lead health care organizations and health systems, we now have interesting evidence to analyze. Starting with a systematic review of the literature, this article presents and discusses the streams of knowledge regarding how management can influence the quality and sustainability of health systems and organizations. Through the analysis of 37 studies, we found that the performance of health care systems and organizations seems to be correlated with management practices, leadership, manager characteristics, and cultural attributes that are associated with managerial values and approaches. There is also evidence that health care organizations run by doctors perform better than others. Finally, we provide a roadmap that indicates how the relationship between the management and performance of health systems and organizations can be further and more effectively investigated.

To account for this we distinguish between different regions, seasons, and energy sources. Short- and long-run temperature demand elasticities are estimated. These features make the model results especially valuable in the analysis of climate change impacts as they provide an empirical basis for the study of the impact of climate change on energy demand. To illustrate the potential of the results as a basis for the study of climate change impacts, the estimates are used in a simple exercise that projects changes in energy demand due to temperatures increase in 2085.</p>"

<p>The literature on budgeting in the public sector has traditionally focused on the annual budgetary process. Much less attention has been paid to rebudgeting-that is, what governments do to revise and update their budgets during the fiscal year. Because of its potentially large impact on appropriations, rebudgeting seemingly deserves more attention than it has been granted so far. This article uses data from a sample of Italian municipalities to test hypotheses on the main drivers of budget revisions. According to the results, rebudgeting is strongly affected by the degree of incrementalism in the initial budgeting process, as well as by several internal and external determinants, such as political variables, organizational features, financial conditions, and the local socioeconomic environment.</p>"

The author conducted a field experiment with a sample of nurses at a public hospital in Italy to investigate the interplay between job performance, PSM, and two conditions: exposure to contact with beneficiaries and self-persuasion interventions. Both treatments had positive effects on participants' persistence, output, productivity, and vigilance. Baseline PSM strengthened these positive effects. Moreover, both conditions caused an increase in PSM that partially mediated the positive effects of beneficiary contact and self-persuasion on job performance. The implications of the experimental findings for theory and practice are discussed.</p>"

<p>We consider a liberalized electricity market, divided in zones interconnected by capacitated transmission links, where a large dimensional power producer operates. We introduce a model for determining the optimal bidding strategies of the large dimensional producer, so as to maximize his own market share, while guaranteeing an annual profit target and satisfying technical constraints. The model determines the optimal medium-term resource scheduling and yields the hourly zonal electricity prices, as it includes constraints representing the Market Clearing process. In order to compute the global solution, the complementarity conditions are formulated as mixed integer linear constraints and the revenue terms are expressed by piece-wise linear functions. The model can be used for analyzing the behavior of market prices in electricity markets where a large dimensional producer can exert market power. It can also be used by investors as a simulation tool for evaluating both the impact on the market and the profitability of investment decisions in the zonal electricity market. A case study related to the Italian electricity market is discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

Our measure of development is the urban population, and we relate it to geographical and institutional variables at both city and regional level. We find that the quality of institutions as measured by the experience of free city-state and the presence of a university has a positive effect on urban development, whereas we could not find a robust impact of the quality of regional government. However, we also find that cities located in mountain areas grew less than cities located in lowlands, possibly with access to the sea. We interpret these results as evidence of the importance of urban institutions and geography in shaping urban development.</p>"

<p>Humor is ubiquitous and often beneficial, but the conditions that elicit it have been debated for millennia. We examine two factors that jointly influence perceptions of humor: the degree to which a stimulus is a violation (tragedy vs. mishap) and one's perceived distance from the stimulus (far vs. close). Five studies show that tragedies (which feature severe violations) are more humorous when temporally, socially, hypothetically, or spatially distant, but that mishaps (which feature mild violations) are more humorous when psychologically close. Although prevailing theories of humor have difficulty explaining the interaction between severity and distance revealed in these studies, our results are consistent with the proposal that humor occurs when a violation simultaneously seems benign. This benign-violation account suggests that distance facilitates humor in the case of tragedies by reducing threat, but that closeness facilitates humor in the case of mishaps by maintaining some sense of threat.</p>"

<p>This paper studies a model whereby exclusive dealing (ED) can both promote investment and foreclose a more efficient supplier. Since ED promotes the incumbent seller's investment, the seller and the buyer realize a greater surplus from bilateral trade under exclusivity.

The paper therefore invites a more cautious attitude towards accepting possible investment promotion arguments as a defense for ED.</p>"

<p>Simulation models support managers in the solution of complex problems. International agencies recommend uncertainty and global sensitivity methods as best practice in the audit, validation and application of scientific codes. However, numerical complexity, especially in the presence of a high number of factors, induces analysts to employ less informative but numerically cheaper methods. This work introduces a design for estimating global sensitivity indices from given data (including simulation input-output data), at the minimum computational cost. We address the problem starting with a statistic based on the L-1-norm. A formal definition of the estimators is provided and corresponding consistency theorems are proved. The determination of confidence intervals through a bias-reducing bootstrap estimator is investigated. The strategy is applied in the identification of the key drivers of uncertainty for the complex computer code developed at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) assessing the risk of lunar space missions. We also introduce a symmetry result that enables the estimation of global sensitivity measures to datasets produced outside a conventional input-output functional framework. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

<p>Manuscript Type Review Research Question/Issue The article is concerned with the prevalence, character, and development of qualitative research within the field of corporate governance. The paper provides an overview of published qualitative research in the field of corporate governance based on a structured literature search of papers published in scholarly peer-reviewed journals between 1986 and 2011. Research Findings/Insights A fine-grained search based on key words resulted in a sample of 78 qualitative corporate governance studies. A review and content analysis of these studies show that qualitative studies in governance have grown in number since the 1990s, but remain a small fraction of the published work on corporate governance. Studies are mostly developed by UK and European scholars, published in European journals and tend to explore boards of directors more than other governance related actors and mechanisms. These studies utilize a range of disciplines, predominantly management, adopting a wide range of methods, the most prevalent being that of the interview, often in combination with other methods to get a better account of the empirical phenomenon. Theoretical/Academic Implications The search reveals an eclectic range of theories, spanning several disciplines, which is serving to generate, elaborate, and refine theorizing about corporate governance and the associated meanings, mechanisms, processes and relationships. There is much scope and need for more qualitative studies of significant rigor and relevance which explore the array of interactions and processes involved in corporate governance, across different levels of analysis and contexts. Practitioner/Policy Implications After over two decades of research and reform of corporate governance, problems of practice remain, and corporate governance prescription via codes and other forms of regulation is increasing in search of better governance. Qualitative research can assist policy-makers and practitioners to develop more efficient governance mechanisms, by shedding light on the efficacy of policy prescription. Qualitative research provides a basis for rethinking and challenging some of the dominant assumptions and meanings about how governance actors and institutions actually function.</p>"

To organize the discussion, we present a new model of regional development that introduces into a standard migration framework elements of both the Lucas (1978) model of the allocation of talent between entrepreneurship and work, and the Lucas (1988) model of human capital externalities.

<p>The increase in international migration to rich countries during the last two decades has spurred research and policy questions. The economic determinants of national and international migrations and the impact of immigrants on labor markets have been investigated by economists, geographers, and regional scientists for a long time. Recently, however, the availability of new and detailed individual data on migrants across regions and localities in several countries has made it possible to analyze the impact of immigration on a richer set of socio-economic outcomes. Two avenues of research have emerged as particularly interesting and are the focus of this special issue. First, international migrants are particularly concentrated in urban areas but their impact on some outcomes that are particularly relevant in cities (such as crime and housing markets) are not well understood yet. Second, immigrants not only increase labor supply but also affect firms' productivity, survival and growth through their impact on localized externalities. These two themes link all the contributions of this special issue and show new directions for future research on the impact of immigration.</p>"

<p>Background: This study illustrates an evidence-based method for the segmentation analysis of patients that could greatly improve the approach to population-based medicine, by filling a gap in the empirical analysis of this topic. Segmentation facilitates individual patient care in the context of the culture, health status, and the health needs of the entire population to which that patient belongs. Because many health systems are engaged in developing better chronic care management initiatives, patient profiles are critical to understanding whether some patients can move toward effective self-management and can play a central role in determining their own care, which fosters a sense of responsibility for their own health. A review of the literature on patient segmentation provided the background for this research.</p>
<p>Method: First, we conducted a literature review on patient satisfaction and segmentation to build a survey. Then, we performed 3,461 surveys of outpatient services users. The key structures on which the subjects' perception of outpatient services was based were extrapolated using principal component factor analysis with varimax rotation. After the factor analysis, segmentation was performed through cluster analysis to better analyze the influence of individual attitudes on the results.</p>
<p>Results: Four segments were identified through factor and cluster analysis: the ""unpretentious,"" the ""informed and supported,"" the ""experts"" and the ""advanced"" patients. Their policies and managerial implications are outlined.</p>
<p>Conclusions: With this research, we provide the following:</p>
<p>-a method for profiling patients based on common patient satisfaction surveys that is easily replicable in all health systems and contexts;</p>
<p>-a proposal for segments based on the results of a broad-based analysis conducted in the Italian National Health System (INHS).</p>
<p>Segments represent profiles of patients requiring different strategies for delivering health services. Their knowledge and analysis might support an effort to build an effective population-based medicine approach.</p>"

<p>This paper examines retail competition in a liberalized gas market. Vertically integrated firms run both wholesale activities (buying gas from the producers under take-or-pay obligations) and retail activities (selling gas to final customers). The market is decentralized and the firms decide which customers to serve, competing then in prices. We show that TOP clauses limit the incentives to face-to-face competition and determine segmentation and monopoly pricing even when entry of new competitors occurs. The development of wholesale trade, instead, may induce generalized entry and retail competition. This equilibrium outcome is obtained if a compulsory wholesale market is introduced, even when firms are vertically integrated, or under vertical separation of wholesale and retail activities when firms can use only linear bilateral contracts.

<p>Advances in clinical and basic sciences are raising the potential to use genetic and clinical biomarkers to identify a subgroup of patients who would most likely benefit from treatment, and to evaluate the benefit of treatment in that subgroup. To make full use of this potential, special clinical trial designs and analyses are needed. For identifying and evaluating a subgroup based on a single continuous biomarker, the most informative approach is the biomarker-analysis design, which is a randomized trial whose analysis involves estimation of the treatment benefit within patient groups defined with respect to various cutpoints or intervals of the biomarker. For identifying and evaluating a subgroup considering a range of possible markers, the adaptive signature design is recommended. In the adaptive signature design, participants are randomly split into training and test samples, a rule for creating the subgroup is formulated in the training sample, and treatment benefit is estimated in the test sample. The adaptive signature design can be usefully extended via the sliding-window subgroup plot that was originally developed for the biomarker-analysis design.

The resulting series of time-varying predictive coefficients is regressed on industrial production growth and a recession dummy. Our results support the view of a negative relationship between predictability and output growth.

<p>Background: The culture of New Public Management has promoted the diffusion of strategic management tools throughout Public Healthcare Organisations (PHOs). There is consensus that better strategic planning tools are required to achieve higher levels of organisational performance. This paper provides evidence and understanding of the emergent uses and scope of strategic planning in PHOs, in order to answer three research questions: (i) has the New Public Management approach changed the organisational culture of PHOs in terms of how they adopt, diffuse, and use strategic planning documents? (ii) how coherent are strategic planning documents in PHOs? and (iii) what are the main purposes of strategic documents in PHOs?</p>
<p>Methods: An analysis was carried out in three Italian Local Health Authorities. We analysed the number and types of formal strategic documents adopted between 2004 and 2012, evaluating their degree of coherence and coordination, their hierarchy, their degree of disclosure, and the consistency of their strategic goals. A content analysis was performed to investigate overlap in terms of content and focus, and a qualitative analysis was carried out to study and represent the relationships between documents.</p>
<p>Results: The analysis showed that a rich set of strategic documents were adopted by each PHO. However, these are often uncoordinated and overlap in terms of content. They adopt different language and formats for various stakeholders. The presence of diverse external drivers may explain the divergent focus, priorities and inconsistent goals in the strategic documents. This planning complexity makes it difficult to determine how the overall goals and mission of an organisation are defined and made visible.</p>
<p>Conclusions: The evidence suggests that PHOs use a considerable number of strategic documents. However, they employ no clear or explicit overarching strategy currently, and strategic planning appears to be externally oriented. All the documents communicate similar topics to different stakeholders, although they use different language to answer to the different expectations of each stakeholder. Therefore, strategic planning and plans seem to be driven by neo-institutional approaches, as they are means to build consensus and negotiate ground for strategic actions, rather than means to identify strategic choices and priorities.</p>"

<p>Using a sample of 4,122 project finance loans worth $769 billion arranged from 1991 to 2005, we demonstrate that certification by prestigious lead arranging banks creates economic value by reducing overall loan spreads compared to loans arranged by less prestigious arrangers. Banks participating in these loan syndicates, rather than the project sponsors, pay for this certification. They do so by allowing top tier arrangers to keep larger fractions of the upfront arranging fees. Results are robust to the correction for the endogenous choice of loans by prestigious arrangers and indicate that certification is even more valuable during periods of extreme financial stress.</p>"

Both academics and practitioners have investigated this phenomenon proposing innovative offering methodologies. In this paper we explore the information revelation and underpricing properties of two baseline models, uniform auctions and bookbuilding, and two newly proposed mechanisms, Ausubel auction and Competitive IPO. Our findings confirm the empirical weaknesses of bookbuilding and provide hints that standard auctions may stimulate less bidding. However, (a) the Competitive IPO features increase competition both among banks and among investors resulting in more information revelation and less underpricing than standard bookbuilding; and (b) the Ausubel auction yields superior price discovery and underpricing outcomes than uniform clock auction and bookbuilding. Our experimental results provide novel insights into the ongoing debate on optimal equity offering mechanisms, suggesting that the solution to current issuing methodologies shortcomings may require the development of a hybrid' procedure blending properties of existing and new mechanisms.</p>"

<p>This article evaluates whether cost-sharing public interventions are successful in promoting agricultural technology uptake by small and medium farmers, and whether these changes can affect yields. Our article contributes to the debate by providing empirical evidence, which is scarce in the literature, from a programme offering extension services to fruit producers in Uruguay. Using a unique panel data set, we estimate a fixed effects model for the impact of extension services on technology adoption and yields. We find evidence that the programme increased density of plantation. Once we address small sample issues, we also find some evidence of impact on the adoption of improved varieties. However, we find no evidence of impact on yields for the period under study. Although this lack of effects on yields could be due to the limited time frame of the evaluation and does not rule out effects on other measures of productivity, it may also indicate that the practices promoted by the programme are insufficient to induce a detectable impact on productivity and, consequently, sustainable benefits for the farmers. The study, therefore, confirms the need of including the design of impact evaluations in the policy design in order to properly consider the timing of all the potential effects and produce conclusive findings and precise recommendations.</p>"

<p>We use use cross-country data on a sample of large European banks to evaluate the impact of government ownership on bank risk. We distinguish between default risk (likelihood of creditors' losses) and operating risk (likelihood of negative equity). Our analysis is based on the joint use of issuer ratings, a synthetic measure of a bank's probability of default, and individual ratings, which omit the influence of any external support and focus on a bank's operating risk. We report two main results. First, government-owned banks (GOBS) have lower default risk but higher operating risk than private banks, indicating the presence of governmental protection that induces higher risk taking. Second, GOBs' operating risk and governmental protection tend to increase in election years. These results are consistent with the idea that GOBs pursue political goals and have important policy implications for recently nationalized European banks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

<p>Background: The Ministry of Health in Malawi is implementing a pragmatic and innovative approach for the management of all HIV-infected pregnant women, termed Option B+, which consists of providing life-long antiretroviral treatment, regardless of their CD4 count or clinical stage. Our objective was to determine if Option B+ represents a cost-effective option.</p>
<p>Methods: A decision model simulates the disease progression of a cohort of HIV-infected pregnant women receiving prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy, and estimates the number of paediatric infections averted and maternal life years gained over a ten-year time horizon. We assess the cost-effectiveness from the Ministry of Health perspective while taking into account the practical realities of implementing ART services in Malawi.</p>
<p>Results: If implemented as recommended by the World Health Organization, options A, B and B+ are equivalent in preventing new infant infections, yielding cost effectiveness ratios between US$ 37 and US$ 69 per disability adjusted life year averted in children. However, when the three options are compared to the current practice, the provision of antiretroviral therapy to all mothers (Option B+) not only prevents infant infections, but also improves the ten-year survival in mothers more than four-fold. This translates into saving more than 250,000 maternal life years, as compared to mothers receiving only Option A or B, with savings of 153,000 and 172,000 life years respectively. Option B+ also yields favourable incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) of US$ 455 per life year gained over the current practice.</p>
<p>Conclusion: In Malawi, Option B+ represents a favorable policy option from a cost-effectiveness perspective to prevent future infant infections, save mothers' lives and reduce orphanhood. Although Option B+ would require more financial resources initially, it would save societal resources in the long-term and represents a strategic option to simplify and integrate HIV services into maternal, newborn and child health programmes.</p>"

By reviewing the strategic approach adopted by Kiehl's, a U.S. cosmetic producer and retailer, this study investigates a potential mechanism by which firms interact with communities to build a product differentiation advantage. Because it adheres to and supports a well-defined set of values, Kiehl's not only achieves community membership and gains legitimacy but also strengthens the sense of identity that the relevant communities provide to members. These investments prompt reciprocal community member behaviors, which the company channels into its customer knowledge development process. Finally, this study describes how firmcommunity interactions protect the firm's differentiation advantage by turning its products into symbols of the communities to which Kiehl's customers belong.</p>"

<p>Increasing evidence points to a fundamental role of early nutrition on rates of growth and development, and later health. We may identify three major fields of scientific interest and clinical application. (1) In developing countries poor growth is associated with greater risk of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases, mainly lower respiratory infections and diarrhea. In these settings, failure to promote compensatory growth may have negative short-term consequences, and the nutritionist's task is the primary prevention of nutrient deficiencies to promote the full expression of the individual genetic potential, while allowing for recovery of early secondary functional deficiencies. (2) A second challenge for nutritionists is represented by the approach to growth impairments in rare disorders, ranging from congenital disorders to chronic infections. Most disorders are favorably influenced by improved nutritional status and better growth, and patients may satisfactorily reach adolescence, pubertal and reproductive age, up to ageing. Even for the less positive conditions, an improvement in the quality of life for families is in any case a rewarding aim. (3) A third challenge is represented by the definition of the role of nutrition on growth in physiological conditions for all individuals. Concern has been raised about the potential adverse long-term consequences of accelerated child growth rates, possibly resulting in a predisposition to develop non-communicable chronic diseases in the adult age. Accordingly, this hypothesis might explain the benefits of breastfeeding in terms of slower early growth, and the fetal origins hypothesis in terms of adverse postnatal catch-up growth in infants born small. Therefore, growth as viewed by a pediatric nutritionist perspective is a complex matter, ranging from the early stages of intrauterine development up to adult ages and ageing processes. Cost/benefit analyses of interventions on growth such as cost per DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) or QALYs (quality-adjusted life years) should be expanded on population basis and extended also to congenital and invalidating disorders to identify the most effective and economic sustainable strategies of action.

Assigning the power of confirmation to one of the two players alone, rather than alternating the role of a leader significantly increases the probability of cooperation in the first bargaining period.

<p>A general view in the corporate governance literature is that corporate ownership structures are rather stable in time and change slowly. However, even if changes in ownership structures are difficult due to path dependence, anecdotal evidence indicates that some sort of transition towards the US style corporate ownership could be occurring in civil-law countries. The aim of this article is to test the so-called ""law and finance"" view, which predicts that this convergence will only happen if the appropriate regulatory framework is in place. We test this prediction using longitudinal data from Italian listed companies, assessing the effects of recent legal reforms. Our results show that an increase in the protection of investors' rights is associated with a lower use of control enhancing mechanisms and a lower separation of control and cash flow rights, while it is less evident if it is associated with a more dispersed ownership.

<p>The theory of resource partitioning proposes that competition among generalists in the center of a market can trigger a process of resource release that engenders a proliferation of specialist producers outside the center. Previous research has generally examined the relationship between this proliferation and market concentration-a correlate of competitive intensity in the center of the market. In this paper, we extend the theory by arguing that resource release also occurs as the degree of competitive overlap among producers in the center intensifies, even when concentration or other structural features do not vary; we expand its implications by demonstrating that increased competitive overlap in the market center can enhance the viability of producers positioned near the center more than those in the periphery; and we enrich and complete it by specifying the additional assumptions needed to extend the theory of resource partitioning to entry processes. Consistent with our expectations, an empirical examination of the Italian broadcast television industry, from 1992 to 2003, finds that the failure rates of both near-center and peripheral stations decline with greater competitive overlap in the programming of the national broadcasters, with the failure rates of the near-center stations falling more than those of peripheral stations. Greater competitive overlap similarly stimulates the entry of near-center stations more than peripheral ones.</p>"

<p>This article argues that current public management theory is not fit for purpose-if it ever has been. It argues that it contains two fatal flaws-it focuses on intraorganizational processes at a time when the reality of public services delivery is interorganizational, and it draws upon management theory derived from the experience of the manufacturing sector and which ignores the reality of public services as ""services."" The article subsequently argues for a ""public service dominant"" approach. This not only more accurately reflects the reality of contemporary public management but also draws upon a body of substantive service-dominant theory that is more relevant to public management than the previous manufacturing focus. We argue that this approach makes an innovative contribution to public management theory in the era of the New Public Governance. The article concludes by exploring the implications of this approach in four domains of public management and by setting a research agenda for a public-service dominant theory for the future.</p>"

<p>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a leading cause of morbidity in the female population, with high levels of prevalence and recurrence within 6 months.</p>
<p>Our objective was to estimate annual costs and health resource utilization by women with UTIs, and the impact on quality of life (QoL) due to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), vaginal pain and dyspareunia. The secondary objective was to estimate the cost per episode of cystitis in a subgroup of patients with recurrent UTIs.</p>
<p>We conducted a retrospective analysis of medical records of a cohort of 309 female patients with a history of UTI. Annual costs and costs per episode were estimated as composites of costs per diagnosis, costs per pharmacological therapy and costs per physician visit, according to the Italian National Health Service (NHS) perspective.</p>
<p>The mean number of episodes of cystitis per patient was 4.5 (median [interquartile range, IQR] 3 [1-6]). The mean time from the onset of symptoms was 9 years (median [IQR] 7 [3-11]), excluding 13 % of values missing for this variable. Recurrent UTIs were diagnosed in 122 (39 %) patients. Overall, 243 (78 %) patients had an impaired sex life and 51 (17 %) had interrupted sex lives as a result of UTIs. Patients' median rates of discomfort due to LUTS or dyspareunia on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0-10 were 8 (IQR 7-10) and 8 (IQR 8-10), respectively. Mean annual direct cost per patient due to UTI was a,not sign229 (median [IQR] a,not sign107 [a,not sign53-241]), estimated mean direct cost per episode in patients with UTI was a,not sign236; whilst in women with recurrent UTI, the mean direct cost per episode was a,not sign142 (p < 0.0001).</p>
<p>Annual mean costs and impact on QoL caused by UTIs are not negligible. Patients resign themselves to the relief of symptoms with recurring UTIs because improvement in health benefit is minimal. Persistence of the disease and the difference in mean costs per episode in patients with recurrent UTIs versus patients with a single episode UTI, which we have called ""costs of resignation"", suggest that appropriate early evaluation and effective treatment measures for the disease are still difficult in clinical practice.</p>"

<p>This paper discusses pooling versus model selection for nowcasting with large datasets in the presence of model uncertainty. In practice, nowcasting a low-frequency variable with a large number of high-frequency indicators should account for at least two data irregularities: (i) unbalanced data with missing observations at the end of the sample due to publication delays; and (ii) different sampling frequencies of the data. Two model classes suited in this context are factor models based on large datasets and mixed-data sampling (MIDAS) regressions with few predictors. The specification of these models requires several choices related to, amongst other things, the factor estimation method and the number of factors, lag length and indicator selection. Thus there are many sources of misspecification when selecting a particular model, and an alternative would be pooling over a large set of different model specifications. We evaluate the relative performance of pooling and model selection for nowcasting quarterly GDP for six large industrialized countries. We find that the nowcast performance of single models varies considerably over time, in line with the forecasting literature. Model selection based on sequential application of information criteria can outperform benchmarks. However, the results highly depend on the selection method chosen. In contrast, pooling of nowcast models provides an overall very stable nowcast performance over time. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>In the last two decades, the auto industry has shown a steady increase of vehicle development outsourcing and a shift of both product development tasks and knowledge from carmakers to suppliers. This trend has increased the interest toward product modularity as a tool to ease the integration of external sources of innovation but there is contradictory evidence concerning the benefits of modularity in inter-firm coordination in the automotive industry. Moreover, although modularity literature considers standard interfaces one of the constitutive elements of modularity and a means for easing design outsourcing, very few studies have analyzed the genesis and the micro-dynamics of the interfaces definition process. In order to fill this research gap, this paper focuses on how assemblers and suppliers define the component-vehicle interfaces in component co-development projects. This study adopts a ""quasi-experimental design approach"" comparing two similar vehicle component co-development projects carried out by the same first-tier supplier with two different automakers. Under the ceteris paribus conditions defined by the research design, the empirical evidence derived from the analysis of the two projects shows that, differently from what modularity theory claims: the interface definition process is neither technologically determined nor the mere result of product architectural choices; the OEMs and the supplier's capabilities, degree of vertical integration, knowledge and strategic focus drive the partitioning of the design and engineering tasks, the interfaces definition process, and the choice of the inter-firm coordination mechanisms. Furthermore, while component modularity and design outsourcing are considered as complements in modularity literature, our findings suggest that they may work as substitutes and are rather difficult to combine.

<p>We study political distortions that emerge in situations where agents' political power is disproportionate with respect to their economic power. We use the Shapley value to evaluate both the economic and the political power. We show that usual weighted majority voting cannot prevent political distortions from emerging in a huge mass of situations. Distortions are less severe if partners can leave the union at low cost.</p>
<p>We propose an alternative voting method based on random assignments of voting rights. Agents are given chances to vote instead of weights. If chances are computed according to a specific formula, no political distortion occurs. As an application, we analyze the rotation voting system recently adopted by the European Central Bank. We find that this system yields an enormous amount of political distortion. Then we compute the voting chances that should be assigned to Eurozone countries in order to eliminate it.

<p>This paper relies on wavelet multiresolution analysis to investigate the dependence structure and predictability of currency markets across different timescales. It explores the nature and direction of causality among the exchange rates with respect to the US dollar of the most widely traded currencies, namely Euro, Great Britain Pound and Japanese Yen. The timescale analysis involves the estimation of linear, nonlinear and spectral causal relationships of wavelet components and aggregate series as well as the investigation of their out-of-sample predictability. Moreover, this study attempts to probe into the micro-foundations of across-scale causal heterogeneity on the basis of trader behavior with different time horizons. The examined period starts from the introduction of the Euro and covers the dot-com bubble, the financial crisis of 2007-2010 and the Eurozone debt crisis. Technically, this paper presents an invariant discrete wavelet transform that deals efficiently with phase shifts, dyadic-length and boundary effects. It also proposes a new entropy-based methodology for the determination of the optimal decomposition level and a wavelet-based forecasting approach. Overall, there is no indication of a global causal behavior that dominates at all time-scales. In the out-of-sample analysis wavelets clearly outperform the random walk for the volatility series. Moreover, the synergistic application of wavelet decomposition and artificial neural networks provided with an enhanced predictability in many forecast horizons for the returns.

This performance persistence is mostly due to compensation for currency risk-taking as there is no strong evidence of remuneration for active management.

<p>Background: A plethora of clinical studies have assessed the benefits of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and supported their use in clinical practice. However, evidence on the safety and efficacy of ICDs appears insufficient to support expansion of their use in clinical practice, and more information on their impact in real life settings is warranted. This paper aims to investigate the impact of ICDs using a large administrative dataset reflecting actual clinical practice.</p>
<p>Methods: Data were obtained from the hospital discharge database of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region in Italy containing patient-level information on 169,488 cases. Data on mortality outside hospital were obtained from regional sources. Exact matching method was used to estimate the outcomes associated with ICDs: mortality, length of stay, re-hospitalization and regional expenditure. The method was applied in two steps. First, patients with ICDs were matched with those without using the following: age class (by 5 years), gender, year of admission, type of admission (day hospital vs. ordinary) and primary diagnosis. In the second step, matching included also Charlson Comorbidities Index. Exact matching average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) was used as a main measure of impact.</p>
<p>Results: Compared with matched controls, treatment with ICDs was associated with lower mortality (absolute risk reduction 10.6% at 1 year and 8.3% at 2 and 8.4% at 3 years, p < 0.001 and hazard ratio 0.80, p < 0.001), greater regional expenditure at index hospitalization (ATT: (sic)9459.64, p < 0.001) and during follow up (ATT: (sic)1707.29, p < 0.001) and higher re-hospitalization rate (ATT: 0.53, p < 0.001). No significant difference was found for length of stay (9.07 vs. 8.86 days). The results were maintained after more restrictive matching was applied.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Assessing the impact of innovative, expensive medical technologies on the basis of real world data is warranted, especially when there are barriers to implementation. Hospital administrative datasets can be of great value when a technology such as the ICD is implemented in a relatively small sample of patients, to allow use of exact matching techniques.</p>"

<p>Malaria is thought to be strictly related to underdevelopment and poverty, and its geographically related origin is now widely recognized. That is, it is endemic only in certain areas of the globe, with environmental and climatic characteristics that are ideal for the proliferation of mosquitoes, which are the vector for transmitting the disease. This feature is the main reason why a large body of economic literature uses mortality from malaria as a proxy with which to measure the effect of geography on human outcomes. Cases of eradication are being scrutinized by scholars to determine the socioeconomic impacts of malaria. Among the various malaria parasites, the worst, Plasmodium falciparum, infested Italian regions for centuries until its eradication in the period 194550. This article presents an empirical assessment of the economic outcomes of the eradication of malaria in the Italian regions by exploiting the spatial variation in mortality rates. I found support for the hypothesis that the eradication of malaria increases human capital in the long run. In particular, I found that eradication increased the years of schooling by about 0.3 years, although my evidence suggests a greater effect on males than on females. Moreover, I found support for a long-run impact of eradication actions that operated through an intergenerational spillover effect and accounted for about 0.07 years of schooling.</p>"

This study frames the antecedents of corporate scandals in terms of the interplay of CEOs' personal traits with corporate strategy and stakeholders' cohesion. With this aim, this study builds on extant theory to examine the case of Banca Popolare di Lodi, an Italian bank involved in a corporate scandal in year 2005.

<p>Capital budgeting frequently involves multiple stages at which firms can continue or abandon ongoing projects. In this paper, we study a project requiring two stages of investment. Failure to fund Stage 1 of the investment precludes investment in Stage 2, whereas failure to fund Stage 2 results in early termination. In contrast to the existing literature, we assume that the firm can limit the manager's informational rents with the early termination of the project. In this setting, we find that the firm optimally commits to a capital allocation scheme whereby it forgoes positive net present value (NPV) projects at Stage 1 (capital rationing), whereas at Stage 2, depending on the manager's previous report, it sometimes implements projects with a negative continuation NPV but in other situations forgoes implementing projects with positive continuation NPVs.</p>"

While some research has emphasized the positive effect of absorption, we focus on the drawbacks of this individual state and on how group-level behaviors can mitigate negative effects on individual learning. We test our cross-level model on 190 individuals embedded in 38 groups. Our results show that (I) cognitive absorption presents an inverted U-shape effect in predicting participant learning; and (2) group learning behavior has a cross-level moderating influence on the relationship between cognitive absorption and participant learning, thus mitigating the negative effects of absorption.</p>"

<p>A reasoning strategy is iterative when the initial conclusion suggested by a set of premises is integrated into that set of premises in order to yield additional conclusions. Previous experimental studies on game theory-based strategic games (such as the beauty contest game) observed difficulty in reasoning iteratively, which has been partly attributed to bounded individual rationality. However, this difficulty has also been attributed to problems in adequately representing the beliefs, actions, and goals of other agents involved in the games. In four experiments, we observed similar difficulties in iterative reasoning in a variety of puzzles and games that did not involve social interactions with other agents, where they can only be caused by individual cognitive boundaries. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that an intrinsic difficulty in iterative reasoning originates from a tendency not to revise our initial mental representation of a problem in light of the initial conclusions that it implies.

<p>Background: Although patient satisfaction is a relevant outcome measure for health care providers, few satisfaction questionnaires have been generally available to physical therapists or have been validated in an Italian population for use in the outpatient setting. The aim of this study was to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the Italian version of the Physical Therapy Outpatient Satisfaction Survey (PTOPS).</p>
<p>Methods: The Italian version of the PTOPS (PTOPS-I) was developed through forward-backward translation, review, and field-testing a pre-final version. The reliability of the final questionnaire was measured by internal consistency and test-retest stability at 7 days. Factor analysis was also used to explore construct validity. Concurrent validity was measured by comparing PTOPS-I with a 5-point Likert-type scale measure assessing the Global Perceived Effect (GPE) of the treatment and with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).</p>
<p>Results: 354 outpatients completed the PTOPS-I, and 56 took the re-test. The internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) of the original domains (Enhancers, Detractors, Location, and Cost) was 0.758 for Enhancers, 0.847 for Detractors, 0.885 for Location, and 0.706 for Cost. The test-retest stability (Intra-class Correlation Coefficients) was 0.769 for Enhancers, 0.893 for Detractors, 0.862 for Location, and 0.862 for Cost. The factor analysis of the Italian version revealed a structure into four domains, named Depersonalization, Inaccessibility, Ambience, and Cost. Concurrent validity with GPE was significantly demonstrated for all domains except Inaccessibility. Irrelevant or non-significant correlations were observed with VAS.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The PTOPS-I showed good psychometric properties. Its use can be suggested for Italian-speaking outpatients who receive physical therapy.</p>"

<p>The wage paid to politicians affects both the choice of citizens to run for office and the performance of those who are appointed. First, if skilled individuals shy away from politics because of higher opportunities in the private sector, an increase in politicians' pay may change their mind. Second, if the re-election prospects of incumbents depend on their in-office deeds, a higher wage may foster performance. We use data on all Italian municipal governments from 1993 to 2001 and test these hypotheses in a quasi-experimental setup. In Italy, the wage of mayors depends on population size and sharply rises at different thresholds. We apply a regression discontinuity design to the only threshold that uniquely identifies a wage increase: 5,000 inhabitants. Exploiting the existence of a two-term limit, we further disentangle the composition from the incentive component of the effect of the wage on performance. Our results show that a higher wage attracts more-educated candidates, and that better-paid politicians size down the government machinery by improving efficiency.

<p>We quantify the private returns and social costs of political connections exploiting a unique longitudinal dataset that combines matched employeremployee data for a representative sample of Italian firms with administrative archives on the universe of individuals appointed in local governments over the period 19851997. According to our results, the revenue premium granted by political connections amounts to 5.7% on average, it is obtained through changes in domestic sales but not in exports, and it is not related to improvements in firm productivity. The connection premium is positive for upstream producers for the public administration only, and larger (up to 22%) in areas characterized by high public expenditure and high levels of corruption. These findings suggest that the gains in market power derive from public demand shifts towards politically connected firms. We estimate that such shifts reduce the provision of public goods by approximately 20%.</p>"

<p>The introduction of mass vaccination against Varicella-Zoster-Virus (VZV) is being delayed in many European countries because of, among other factors, the possibility of a large increase in Herpes Zoster (HZ) incidence in the first decades after the initiation of vaccination, due to the expected decline of the boosting of Cell Mediated Immunity caused by the reduced varicella circulation. A multi-country model of VZV transmission and reactivation, is used to evaluate the possible impact of varicella vaccination on HZ epidemiology in Italy, Finland and the UK. Despite the large uncertainty surrounding HZ and vaccine-related parameters, surprisingly robust medium-term predictions are provided, indicating that an increase in HZ incidence is likely to occur in countries where the incidence rate is lower in absence of immunization, possibly due to a higher force of boosting (e.g. Finland), whereas increases in HZ incidence might be minor where the force of boosting is milder (e.g. the UK). Moreover, a convergence of HZ post vaccination incidence levels in the examined countries is predicted despite different initial degrees of success of immunization policies. Unlike previous model-based evaluations, our investigation shows that after varicella immunization an increase of HZ incidence is not a certain fact, rather depends on the presence or absence of factors promoting a strong boosting intensity and which might or not be heavily affected by changes in varicella circulation due to mass immunization. These findings might explain the opposed empirical evidences observed about the increases of HZ in sites where mass varicella vaccination is ongoing.</p>"

<p>Background: Since 2010, five newly emerging economies collectively known as 'BRICS' (Brazil, India, Russia, China and South Africa) have caught the imagination, and scholarly attention, of political scientists, economists and development specialists. The prospect of a unified geopolitical bloc, consciously seeking to re-frame international (and global) health development with a new set of ideas and values, has also, if belatedly, begun to attract the attention of the global health community. But what influence, if any, do the BRICS wield in global health, and, if they do wield influence, how has that influence been conceptualized and recorded in the literature?</p>
<p>Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review in (March-December 2012) of documents retrieved from the databases EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, Global Health, and Google Scholar, and the websites of relevant international organisations, research institutions and philanthropic organisations. The results were synthesised using a framework of influence developed for the review from the political science literature.</p>
<p>Results: Our initial search of databases and websites yielded 887 documents. Exclusion criteria narrowed the number of documents to 71 journal articles and 23 reports. Two researchers using an agreed set of inclusion criteria independently screened the 94 documents, leaving just 7 documents. We found just one document that provided sustained analysis of the BRICS' collective influence; the overwhelming tendency was to describe individual BRICS countries influence. Although influence was predominantly framed by BRICS countries' material capability, there were examples of institutional and ideational influence - particularly from Brazil. Individual BRICS countries were primarily 'opportunity seekers' and region mobilisers but with potential to become 'issue leaders' and region organisers.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Though small in number, the written output on BRICS influence in global health has increased significantly since a similar review conducted in 2010 found just one study. Whilst it may still be 'early days' for newly-emerging economies influence in global health to have matured, we argue that there is scope to further develop the concept of influence in global health, but also to better understand the ontology of groups of countries such as BRICS. The BRICS have made a number of important commitments towards reforming global health, but if they are to be more than a memorable acronym they need to start putting those collective commitments into action.</p>"

<p>This research investigates the impacts on firm performance of (1) technology versus design innovation and (2) their potentially synergistic interaction. Synergies could arise from complementarities, in particular the utilization of technology innovation as a platform for design innovations. Both sales and Tobin's q are examined as dependent performance variables, with sales tapping consumer responses and Tobin's q reflecting investor responses. Moderation by branding strategy (i.e., Corporate Branding versus Mixed Branding versus House of Brands) is analyzed because innovation may impact performance differently depending on branding strategy. Advertising effects, the number of new product introductions, their interaction, R&D expenditures, operating margins, and firm size are also modeled as covariates. The results show that all main and interaction effects are significant in at least one of the branding groups, and that moderation of model paths by branding strategy was pervasive. Overall, except for technology innovation Tobin's q, Corporate Branding coefficients for technology innovation, design innovation, and their interaction were almost always significantly different from Mixed Branding and House of Brands coefficients, which were not significantly different from each other. Since Mixed Branding and House of Brands proved very similar, these groups were combined under Non-Corporate. First, for technology innovation, the impact on both sales and Tobin's q for Corporate Branding was less than or equal to Noncorporate. Noteworthy was that the technology innovation Tobin's q relationship was equal across all branding strategies; technology innovation appears to be key for investors. Second, for design innovation, the impact for Corporate Branding was positive while for Noncorporate it was null; the same pattern was observed for sales and Tobin's q. Third, for the interaction, the impact for Corporate Branding was significantly less than the positive impacts for Noncorporate. For Noncorporate, the marginal impact of design innovation on sales or Tobin's q increased with the level of technology innovation. For Corporate Branding however, there was no interaction in the case of sales and a negative interaction for Tobin's q. Thus, the marginal impact of design innovation on Tobin's q decreased with increasing levels of technology innovation. These decreasing marginal effects could reflect limits to corporate brand name extensions, as perceived by investors.</p>"

<p>This paper is concerned with the cost-efficiency of Private Finance Initiatives (PFIs) in the delivery of hospital facilities in the UK. We outline a methodology for identifying the ""fair"" return on equity, based on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of each investor. We apply this method to assess the expected returns on a sample of 77 contracts signed between 1997 and 2011 by health care provider organisations in the UK. We show that expected returns are in general in excess of the WACC benchmarks. The findings highlight significant problems in current procurement practices and the methodologies by which bids are assessed. To minimise the financial impact of hospital investments on health care systems, a regulatory regime must ensure that expected returns are set at the ""fair"" rate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The other hypothesis suggests that there should be no systematic alignment between the political preferences of the judges and the success of the central government.

<p>We provide a long-term perspective on the individual retirement behavior and on the future of retirement by emphasizing the role of (negative) income effects. We consider a political economic theoretical framework, with actuarially fair and unfair early retirement schemes, and derive a political equilibrium with positive social security contribution rates and early retirement. A reduction in the wages in youth, consistent with the recent labor market trends since the massive introduction of temporary jobs, induces workers to postpone retirement, andin the unfair systemleads to lower contribution rates. A reduction in the growth rate of the economy has opposite effects on the retirement decisions, leadingin the unfair systemto more early retirement. Aging induces a negative income effect, but has also an opposite political effect on social security contributions and retirement decisions. For an actuarially fair social security system, we provide conditions for the political effect to dominate; in an unfair scheme, numerical simulations confirm a slight predominance of the political effect, as contribution rates increase. These results may shed some light on the future of early retirement in aging societies.</p>"

<p>Openness requires optimal monetary policy to deviate from the canonical closed economy principle of domestic price stability, even if domestic prices are the only ones to be sticky. The paper reviews this argument using a simple partial equilibrium analysis in an economy that trades in final consumption goods. It then extends the standard open economy New Keynesian model to include imported inputs of production. Production openness strengthens even further the incentive for the policymaker to deviate from strict domestic price stability. With both consumption and production openness, variations in the world price of food and in the world price of imported oil act as exogenous cost-push factors.

<p>In recent years the interest in the forecast and prevention of natural hazards related to hydro-meteorological events has increased the challenge for numerical weather modelling, in particular for limited area models, to improve the quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPF) for hydrological purposes.</p>
<p>After the encouraging results obtained in the MAP D-PHASE Project, we decided to devote further analyses to show recent improvements in the operational use of hydrometeorological chains, and above all to better investigate the key role played by temperature during snowy precipitation.</p>
<p>In this study we present a reanalysis simulation of one meteorological event, which occurred in November 2008 in the Piedmont Region. The attention is focused on the key role of air temperature, which is a crucial feature in determining the partitioning of precipitation in solid and liquid phase, influencing the quantitative discharge forecast (QDF) into the Alpine region. This is linked to the basin ipsographic curve and therefore by the total contributing area related to the snow line of the event.</p>
<p>In order to assess hydrological predictions affected by meteorological forcing, a sensitivity analysis of the model output was carried out to evaluate different simulation scenarios, considering the forecast effects which can radically modify the discharge forecast.</p>
<p>Results show how in real-time systems hydrological forecasters have to consider also the temperature uncertainty in forecasts in order to better understand the snow dynamics and its effect on runoff during a meteorological warning with a crucial snow line over the basin.</p>
<p>The hydrological ensemble forecasts are based on the 16 members of the meteorological ensemble system COSMO-LEPS (developed by ARPA-SIMC) based on the non-hydrostatic model COSMO, while the hydrological model used to generate the runoff simulations is the rainfall-runoff distributed FEST-WB model, developed at Politecnico di Milano.</p>"

<p>Since the beginning of the millennium, the institutions of the European Union have intensified their political efforts to combat youth employment. Youth-specific policy initiatives were launched after the financial and economic crisis of 2008, and the overall subsequent rise of unemployment rates among young people. In this article, we analyse and assess these developments on the basis of an analysis of European policy documents and interviews. Our conclusions are twofold. One, we argue that the Europe 2020 Strategy and its flagship initiatives devoted to youth do not constitute a new policy field or approach, but are rather the outcome of an incrementalist logic of policy development. Two, the European youth strategy is clearly committed to activation, and it pushes policy developments towards a minimalist policy approach of precarious protection. Both developments are explained by the actor constellations and path dependencies of the European policy arena.</p>"

<p>We use a simple partial adjustment econometric framework to investigate the effects of financial crises on the dynamic properties of yield spreads. We find that crises manifest themselves in the form of substantial disruptions revealed by changes in the persistence of the shocks to spreads as much as by in their unconditional mean levels. Formal breakpoint tests confirm that in the U.S. the Great Financial Crisis has been over approximately since the Spring of 2009 and provide a conservative dating centered around the August 2007-June 2009 dates. However, some yield spread series point to an end of the most serious disruptions as early as in December 2008. Some symptoms of an impending crisis re-appear instead in the second half of 2011. We also uncover evidence that the LSAP program implemented by the Fed in the U.S. residential mortgage market has been effective, in the sense that the risk premia in this market have been uniquely shielded from the disruptive effects of the crisis.

In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted in Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine by national researchers with representatives from a sample of 49 civil society organizations (CSOs) and 22 national key informants.

<p>Team network structure has been shown to be an important determinant of both team and individual performance outcomes, yet few studies have investigated the relationship between team network structure and technology usage behaviors. Drawing from social network and technology use literature, we examine how the structure of a team's advice-seeking network affects individual use of a newly implemented information technology. We develop cross-level hypotheses related to the effects of the structure of mutually interconnected ties within the team (i.e., internal closure) as well as the structure of nonredundant ties outside the team boundaries (i.e., external bridging). The hypotheses are tested in a field study of 265 employees working in 44 teams in a large financial services institution. Results show that internal closure has a U-shaped effect on individual use such that individual usage of the system is higher when the number of internaladvice-seeking ties within the team is low or high, suggesting that medium levels of internal closure are the least desirable network configurations because in such instances teams neither realize the benefits of high closure information sharing nor are they able to avoid in-group biases associated with low closure conditions. Our results also reveal that in addition to having a direct positive effect on individual use, external bridging interacts with internal closure in a complex manner. The U-shaped effect of closure is dominant when bridging is high but assumes an inverted U-shaped pattern when bridging is low. Several implications for managers follow from these findings. First, in order to increase usage of technology, in teams characterized by low internal closure, managers should encourage the development of ties across team boundaries. Second, managers should maximize within-team interconnections in order to facilitate the circulation of external knowledge within team boundaries. Finally, managers should be aware that maximizing internal closure by facilitating interconnections among team members could be dangerous if not accompanied by mechanisms for external bridging.</p>"

Building on this, we argue that actual quality mediates the effect of reputation on revenues more than the effect of status on revenues. Moreover, reputation and status have different effects on how organizations acquire resources: when their product quality is low relative to their aspiration level, organizations will display a preference for recruiting high-reputation resource providers over high-status ones. Conversely, organizations will display a preference for recruiting high-status resource providers over high-reputation ones when their revenue is low relative to their aspiration level. Finally, although both reputation and status have positive effects on the price paid for a resource, we argue that the relationship between reputation and pay is weaker for high-status resource providers.

<p>Technology licensing is an important means for companies to extract more value from their intellectual assets. We build a model that helps understand how licensing activity should be organized within large corporations. More specifically, we compare decentralization-where the business unit using the technology makes licensing decisions-to centralized licensing. The business unit has superior information about licensing opportunities but may not have the appropriate incentives because its rewards depend on product market performance. If licensing is decentralized, the business unit forgoes valuable licensing opportunities because the rewards for licensing are (optimally) weaker than those for product market profits. This distortion is stronger when production-based incentives, especially private benefits, of business unit managers are more powerful, making centralization more attractive. Surprisingly, we find that interdependency across business units may result in more, not less, decentralization. Furthermore, even though centralization results in less information, centralized licensing deals are larger. Our model conforms to the existing evidence that reports heterogeneity across firms in both licensing propensity and organization of licensing.</p>"

Furthermore, our results suggest that while the FDI to China has encouraged both horizontal and vertical FDI to other countries, these FDI complementarities have been strongest in the case of vertical FDI.

<p>We derive the analogue of the classic ArrowPratt approximation of the certainty equivalent under model uncertainty as described by the smooth model of decision making under ambiguity of Klibanoff, Marinacci, and Mukerji (2005). We study its scope by deriving a tractable mean-variance model adjusted for ambiguity and solving the corresponding portfolio allocation problem. In the problem with a risk-free asset, a risky asset, and an ambiguous asset, we find that portfolio rebalancing in response to higher ambiguity aversion only depends on the ambiguous asset's alpha, setting the performance of the risky asset as benchmark. In particular, a positive alpha corresponds to a long position in the ambiguous asset, a negative alpha corresponds to a short position in the ambiguous asset, and greater ambiguity aversion reduces optimal exposure to ambiguity. The analytical tractability of the enhanced ArrowPratt approximation renders our model especially well suited for calibration exercises aimed at exploring the consequences of model uncertainty on equilibrium asset prices.</p>"

<p>Purpose - This paper aims to analyse the risk and return trade-off in the film industry, and to explain the managerial decisions justifying significant investments in such a risky and uncertain sector.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - An extensive dataset of movies released in US theatres over a period of 12 years along with descriptive statistics, frequency analysis and scatter plot methodology are used.</p>
<p>Findings - The findings highlight: a positive relationship, although with high levels of variance, between production budgets and revenues; and a random association between costs and rates of return.</p>
<p>Practical implications - Differently from other commodities, whose demand can be quite accurately estimated, the success of a new film production is extremely uncertain. Therefore, the reason why major film companies have been successful over the last decades, in spite of the extreme variance that is characteristic of the industry, must be found in the management decision approach that they employ to deal with this uncertainty.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The paper uses statistical evidence to draw management implications, rather than only identifying the economic and financial behaviour of the firms running the film industry, in recognising that correct management decision approaches are behind the success of such an uncertain and volatile industry.</p>"

Controlling for this effect, they also access geographically wider knowledge spillovers. This result holds after controlling for alternative explanations, such as the inventors' network and the site where the research is performed. By contributing to individual openness, education thus provides a means to break through geographical barriers to attain knowledge diffusion.</p>"

<p>Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse the issue of welfare use by migrants in Italy and overcome the limitations of previous studies related to the quality of the data and to the high level of fragmentation of the Italian welfare system.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - In this paper the author is able to overcome the limitations of previous research by using an original administrative archive of means tests, performed at all levels of the public administration, to establish individual's and households' eligibility to all kinds of benefits, both in cash and kind.</p>
<p>Findings - Results show that, without controlling for observable characteristics, migrants from outside the EU are more likely to apply for welfare. Once individual and household characteristics are controlled for, such a residual welfare dependency is greatly reduced but does not disappear. Geographical location is a key factor, given that migrants tend to locate in the richest areas of the country, which also happen to be the ones where local welfare is most generous.</p>

<p>Social capital has remained relatively underexplored in innovation literature due to the lack of consensus on the most suitable operationalisation for the analysis of innovative dynamics. This paper aims to fill this gap by looking at social capital as propensity towards civicness and prosocial behaviour that facilitates the circulation of nonredundant knowledge among otherwise disconnected groups. The quantitative analysis of the innovative performance of Italian provinces shows that social capital proxied by blood donations and participation into voluntary associations is an important predictor of innovative performance after controlling for 'traditional' knowledge inputs (R&D and human capital). In addition, instrumental variable analysis makes it possible to identify clear causal links between social capital and innovation, suggesting that social norms play an important role in shaping the incentives for knowledge generation, circulation, and accumulation.</p>"

<p>Marketers are increasingly relying on promotional practices (variously labeled as stealth marketing, hybrid messages, covert advertising) based on the diffusion of product information by third parties that appear to be independent of advertisers. In this paper, we examine to what extent the media treat their advertisers favorably, providing these advertisers' products extra visibility in supposedly neutral editorial content. Empirically, we model the determinant of media coverage of Italian fashion products in an extended dataset of consumer magazines in Italy, France, Germany, UK, and the USA. Research findings show that advertising is an important determinant of product placements in editorial content, and this result is consistent across countries and publishers. Our results imply that resource-rich advertisers engaging in compensatory advertising (that is, advertising investments that compensate poor product quality) might bias media coverage in their favor. Consumers will consequently be exposed twice to favorable messages about those products, in both advertisements and media content, resulting in higher purchases and reduced consumer welfare.</p>"

When the investors enter the equity structure of a company, they play an active and valuable monitoring role that safeguards companies against the risk that the interests of ownership will prevail over their own.

<p>The current research proposes a moderator of the established effect of temporal construal on the weighting of abstract features versus more concrete features-that of the individual's regulatory focus. The moderating effect relies on the presence or absence of a fit between regulatory focus and the time horizon for upcoming decisions (i.e., prevention focus/near future or promotion focus/distant future). Under a promotion (prevention) focus, construal levels are higher in the near (distant) than in the distant (near) future. Four experiments find support for this ""temporal-processing-fit effect"" and provide a perspective on its possible causes, showing that when ""fit"" is the present state, the event is perceived as more important, being locally processed and construed in a concrete manner, than in non-fit states. In the latter states, the event is processed in a global manner and construed abstractly because it is perceived as less important.</p>"

<p>A substantial body of literature has recently been concerned with the structure and dynamics of the collaboration networks that underlie the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge. Despite the growing interest in these networks, relatively little emphasis has been placed on two broad areas of investigation: on the one hand, the interplay of the growth mechanisms underpinning the evolution of collaborative arrangements; on the other, the implications that the structure and multiplexity of these arrangements have on knowledge creation and diffusion. The articles in this Special Issue aim to bridge these gaps in the literature and, by embracing a variety of perspectives, contribute towards a better understanding of how collaboration networks originate, function, and evolve. This Introduction offers a theoretical and methodological framework for the articles here included. It begins by discussing problems of measurement of scientific collaboration, and goes on to examine the role that growth mechanisms, structural variety and multiplexity play in shaping the genesis and functioning of collaboration networks. In reviewing current and emerging research themes, the discussion will also identify promising research directions that will stimulate future work on collaboration networks in science and technology.</p>"

<p>Using data on patent applications at the European Patent Office, we examine the structural properties of networks of inventors in France in different technologies. We find that the higher the presence of inventors from universities and public research organizations (PROs), the more likely the networks are to exhibit small world properties. University and PRO inventors contribute to reduce average path length insofar they are more mobile (across applicants) than other inventors, thus linking up otherwise disconnected cliques. We achieve these results by implementing an original methodology for detecting small world properties in one-mode projections of two-mode graphs.</p>"

<p>We provide evidence that incumbent and entrant firms' access to business group deep pockets affects the entry patterns in product markets. Relying on a unique French data set on business groups, our paper shows that entry into manufacturing industries is negatively related to the cash hoarded by incumbent affiliated groups and positively related to entrant groups' cash. In line with theoretical predictions, we find that the impact of group cash holdingson entry is more important in environments where financial constraints are pronounced. The cash holdings of incumbent and entrant groups also affect the survival rate of entrants in the three- to five-year post-entry window. Overall, our findings suggest that internal capital markets operate within corporate groups and affect the product market behavior of affiliated firms by mitigating financial constraints.

<p>In contexts where competition is intense, growth is rapid, innovation is abundant, local conditions are idiosyncratic, and technological options are increasingly complex, the marketing manager needs to understand the dynamic forces that influence the structure of the industry in order to assess the market strategic value. The problems are made even more difficult when much of the information available is qualitative, not quantitative. In order to reduce endless complexities and produce manageable simplicities, the study proposes a workable systems methodology and a holistic frame of reference that allows managers to focus on relevant issues and avoid the endless search for more details, while drowning in proliferating useless information. This paper presents two cases illustrating systems approaches to marketing strategy and decision-making. The purposes are to contrast a qualitative mapping theory building approach and a quantitative group model building approach to help client groups think systemically about marketing dynamics, and to draw out implications for research and practice in marketing strategy.

<p>Drawing on institutional theory and innovation literature, we argue that greater regulatory and normative pressures concerning environmental issues positively influence companies' propensity to engage in environmental innovation. Analysis of environment-related patents of 326 publicly traded firms from polluting industries in the United States suggests that institutional pressures can trigger such innovation, especially in those firms displaying a greater deficiency gap (i.e., firms polluting relatively more than their industry peers). Moreover, we find that this effect is stronger when asset specificity is high, and that the availability of resources plays different roles depending on the type of pressures (regulatory vs. normative).Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>Several streams of literature have examined the phenomenon of markets for inventions, that is, the trade of elements of knowledge which are disembodied from individuals, organizations, and products. The aims of this paper are to bring together the various streams of research in this area and discuss their major assumptions and limitations, in order to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the phenomenon, and identify promising paths for future research. We start our review by identifying the object of market exchangethat is, an invention whose knowledge has been codified and disembodied from individuals, organizations, or artifacts. We then identify those factors that enable firms to trade inventions, distinguishing between institutional-, firm-, and industry-level factors. We close our analysis of the extant literature by discussing the implications of markets for inventions for firm behavior and performance. Against this background, we highlight an important avenue for future research. A neglected implication of the development of invention markets is that firms are confronted with a wide variety of technological paths from which to choose, because the opportunity to acquire technologies on the market offers them a greater variety that can their internal R&D departments. However, the streams of research on markets for inventions and on R&D allocation strategies have been surprisingly disconnected so far. Hence, in the final section, we start to establish and explore the link between these literatures, and to identify a research agenda in this domain.</p>"

After more than two decades of research on family capitalism, the strengths and the weaknesses of firms run by the immediate and extended family are known in greater depth. The mixture between kinship ties and the sphere of business and economic activity generates not only a unique wealth of strategic opportunities, but also an equal amount of risks and uncertainties which are seriously able to undermine the equilibrium of the company itself. This article looks at some of the most critical dimensions of business activity, showing, upon the basis of the current research in the field, how the intimate nature of family firms not only contributes to risk and uncertainty reduction, but also acts as a negative element, able to increase the level of turbulence and uncertainty both inside the organization and in its relationships with the external environment.</p>"

<p>Mergers and acquisitions (M&A), private equity and leveraged buyouts, securitization and project finance are characterized by the presence of contractual clauses (covenants). These covenants trigger the technical default of the borrower even in the absence of insolvency. Therefore, borrowers may default on loans even when they have sufficient available cash to repay outstanding debt. This condition is not captured by the net present value (NPV) distribution obtained through a standard Monte Carlo simulation. In this paper, we present a methodology for including the consequences of covenant breach in a Monte Carlo simulation, extending traditional risk analysis in investment planning. We introduce a conceptual framework for modeling technical and material breaches from the standpoint of both lenders and shareholders. We apply this framework to a real case study concerning the project financing of a 64-million euro biomass power plant. The simulation is carried out on the actual model developed by the financial advisor of the project and made available to the authors. Results show that both technical and material breaches have a statistically significant impact on the net present value distribution, and this impact is more relevant when leverage and cost of debt increase.

<p>Background. Patient satisfaction is an important measure for evaluating interventions in health care. No patient satisfaction questionnaire for physical therapy treatment has been validated to date for use in an Italian outpatient population.</p>
<p>Objective. The aim of this study was to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the Italian version of the Physical Therapy Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PTPSQ-I).</p>
<p>Design. A measurement study was conducted.</p>
<p>Methods. The PTPSQ-I was developed through forward-backward translation, final review, and pre-final version. An acceptability analysis was first conducted. Reliability was measured by internal consistency (Cronbach alpha), and a factor analysis was applied to investigate the internal structure. Divergent validity was measured by comparing the PTPSQ-I with a visual analog scale (VAS) and with a 5-point Likert-type scale evaluating the global perceived effect (GPE) for the physical therapy treatment.</p>
<p>Results. The process for developing the PTPSQ-I required 3 months using data on 315 outpatients. Based on our initial analyses, 5 items were deleted from the PTPSQ-I, which was renamed the PTPSQ-I(15). The PTPSQ-I(1 5) showed high internal consistency (alpha=.905). Divergent validity was moderate for the GPE (r=.33) but not significant for the VAS (r=-.07). A factor analysis revealed evidence for a 2-factor structure related to perceived ""Overall Experience"" and ""Professional Impression"" that explained 62% of the total variance. A third factor, ""Efficiency and Convenience,"" brought explained total variance to near 70%.</p>
<p>Limitations. It may be necessary to add items to the PTPSQ-I(15) to assess other dimensions not currently represented by these 15 items.</p>

<p>The effects of properties of words on their reading aloud response times (RTs) are 1 major source of evidence about the reading process. The precision with which such RTs could potentially be predicted by word properties is critical to evaluate our understanding of reading but is often underestimated due to contamination from individual differences. We estimated this precision without such contamination individually for 4 people who each read 2,820 words 50 times each. These estimates were compared to the precision achieved by a 31-variable regression model that outperforms current cognitive models on variance-explained criteria. Most (around 2/3) of the meaningful (non-first-phoneme, non-noise) word-level variance remained unexplained by this model. Considerable empirical and theoretical-computational effort has been expended on this area of psychology, but the high level of systematic variance remaining unexplained suggests doubts regarding contemporary accounts of the details of the mechanisms of reading at the level of the word. Future assessment of models can take advantage of the availability of our precise participant-level database.</p>"

<p>This paper explores the study on mixture of a class of probability density functions under type-I censoring scheme. In this paper, we mold a heterogeneous population by means of a two-component mixture of the class of probability density functions. The parameters of the class of mixture density functions are estimated and compared using the Bayes estimates under the squared-error and precautionary loss functions. A censored mixture dataset is simulated by probabilistic mixing for the computational purpose considering particular case of the Maxwell distribution. Closed-form expressions for the Bayes estimators along with their posterior risks are derived for censored as well as complete samples. Some stimulating comparisons and properties of the estimates are presented here. A factual dataset has also been for illustration.</p>"

<p>We study the emergence of strategic behavior in double auctions with an equal number of buyers and sellers, under the distinct assumptions that orders are cleared simultaneously or asynchronously. The evolution of strategic behavior is modeled as a learning process driven by a genetic algorithm. We find that, as the size of the market grows, allocative inefficiency tends to zero and performance converges to the competitive outcome, regardless of the order-clearing rule. The main result concerns the evolution of strategic behavior as the size of the market gets larger. Under simultaneous order-clearing, only marginal traders learn to be price takers and make offers equal to their valuations/costs. Under asynchronous order-clearing, all intramarginal traders learn to be price makers and make offers equal to the competitive equilibrium price. The nature of the order-clearing rule affects in a fundamental way what kind of strategic behavior we should expect to emerge.</p>"

<p>Purpose - The recent transformations brought about by the globalisation of markets have increased the competitive pressure for firms operating in traditional sectors, and in particular for those in industrial districts. The authors' aim is to understand the extent to which firms responded to these new challenges. More particularly, they investigate the determinants of innovation at firm level focusing on the role of firm's outsourcing strategies.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on an original firm-level dataset, the authors analyse the determinants of innovation in a typical Italian industrial district, i.e. the hosiery district of Castel Goffredo in the Third Italy. They apply econometric techniques, in particular OLS and Tobit models.</p>
<p>Findings - The authors' findings suggest that industrial districts are evolving towards a differentiated organisational structure in which innovation is driven by firms, which are focused on core competences and high valued added activities.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - The authors' results should be interpreted with some caution, since the cross-sectional design of their data does not allow them to fully control for potential reverse causation effects, which might be relevant for some of the explanatory variables. Their data do not allow them to include additional instrumental variables, thus they cannot control for endogeneity. Therefore, their interpretation is limited to comment the extent and regularity of the relation between dependent and explanatory variables.</p>
<p>Practical implications - The evidence presented in this study corroborates some arguments highlighted in the current debate about the evolution of industrial districts. A network-based organisation is the dominant organisational structure. The authors have some evidence on the importance of size as driver of innovation.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The authors find original evidence at firm level on the relation between organisational change, in the form of outsourcing, and innovation in the context of an industrial district. They also find empirical support to arguments debated in the recent policy debates on whether small firms can be regarded as engines of innovation in industrial districts.</p>"

Different from the previous literature, the paper considers technology as an endogenous variable in the process of organizational design.

A similarly important role has been played by the set of ethics that motivated the early adherents to the free software movement.

<p>This article analyses contract cancellation and product return policies in markets in which sellers advise customers about the suitability of their offering. When customers are fully rational, it is optimal for sellers to offer the right to cancel or return on favourable terms. A generous return policy makes the seller's ""cheap talk"" at the point of sale credible. This observation provides a possible explanation for the excess refund puzzle and also has implications for the management of customer reviews. When customers are credulous, instead, sellers have an incentive to set unfavourable terms to exploit the inflated beliefs they induce in their customers. The imposition of a minimum statutory standard improves welfare and consumer surplus when customers are credulous. In contrast, competition policy reduces contractual inefficiencies with rational customers, but it is not effective with credulous customers.</p>"

<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To discuss issues and concerns in the application of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to the decision to have a child.</p>
<p>METHOD</p>
<p>We review the basic structure of the TPB, its principles, and its assumptions as they apply to fertility decisions. Among other issues we consider attitudes, subjective norms, and perceptions of control as antecedents to the decision to have a child; the expectancy-value model for understanding the formation of these antecedents; and the role of background factors, such as institutional policies, societal values, and personal characteristics. We illustrate key elements of the TPB using results from a multinational research project and end by considering a number of open questions for TPB-guided fertility research.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
<p>We conclude that the TPB can usefully be employed to further our understanding of fertility decisions. By examining behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about having a child we can identify important considerations that influence this decision. The information obtained can also guide adoption of policies or interventions designed to encourage (or discourage) couples to have more children.</p>"

<p>Payment card networks, such as Visa, require merchants' banks to pay substantial ""interchange"" fees to cardholders' banks on a per transaction basis. This paper shows that a network's profit-maximizing fee induces an inefficient price structure, oversubsidizing card usage and overtaxing merchants. We show that this distortion is systematic and arises from the fact that consumers make two distinct decisions (membership and usage), whereas merchants make only one (membership). In general, we contribute to the theory of two-sided markets by introducing a model that distinguishes between extensive and intensive margins, thereby explaining why two-part tariffs are useful pricing tools for platforms.</p>"

<p>Corporate social responsibility studies prove that an employee is increasingly a key stakeholder for companies. Firms are starting to think about their workforce as a real opportunity to manage and improve their human and economic capital. Employee welfare and benefit schemes are particularly important in this perspective and top companies are investing significantly in this direction. On the basis of an empirical cross-analysis, conducted on a questionnaire addressed to its own employees, by one of the world's biggest multinational groups, and in which the level of satisfaction of benefits and welfare schemes is investigated, significant results emerged: the utility of benefits is marginally higher in women than in men; an evident direct linear relationship exists between job standing and benefit satisfaction, with the exception of factory workers; seniority and age variance of employees do not imply different marginal utility in benefits. Furthermore, the implementation of some limited cost benefits would generate higher marginal utility in employees than of other, more expensive and exclusive, benefits.</p>"

<p>Organizations are increasingly moving toward a team-based structure for managing complex knowledge in new product development (NPD) projects. Such teams operate in an environment characterized by dynamic project requirements and emergent nonroutine issues, which can undermine their ability to achieve project objectives. Team improvisation-a collective, spontaneous, and creative action for identifying novel solutions to emergent problems-has been identified as a key team-situated response to unexpected challenges to NPD team effectiveness. Geographic dispersion is increasingly becoming a reality for NPD teams that find themselves needing to improvise solutions to emergent challenges while attempting to leverage the knowledge of team members who are physically distributed across various locations. However, very little is known about how teams' improvisational actions affect performance when such actions are executed in increasingly dispersed teams. To address this gap in the literature, this paper draws on the emerging literature on different forms and degrees of team dispersion to understand how team improvisation affects team performance in such teams. In particular this paper takes into account both the structural and psychological facets of dispersion by considering the physical distance between team members, the configuration of the team across different sites, as well as the team members' perception of being distant from their teammates. Responses from 299 team leaders and team members of 71 NPD projects in the software industry were used to analyze the relationship between team improvisation and team performance, as well as the moderating effect of the three different conceptualizations of team dispersion. Results of the study indicate that team improvisation has a positive influence on project team performance by allowing team members to respond to unexpected challenges through creative and timely action. However, increasing degrees of team member dispersion (both structural and psychological) attenuate this relationship by making it difficult to have timely access to other team members' knowledge and by limiting real-time interactions that may lead to the development of creative solutions. The results of this research offer guidance to managers about when to balance the desire to leverage expertise to cope with unexpected events. Moreover, the present paper provides directions for future research on improvisation and team dispersion. Future research is encouraged to investigate factors that may help highly dispersed teams to overcome the shortcomings of team dispersion in dealing with emergent events.</p>"

<p>This study examines how frontline service employees (FSEs) can learn from recovery services and improve their performance accordingly. While research recognizes that FSEs can fulfill an innovation role by sourcing customer knowledge and developing ideas for performance improvement, it remains unclear whether such a role benefits or impairs the FSE's primary recovery service role of providing efficient and thorough solutions to customer problems. This research models both FSE roles and explores under which conditions it is beneficial for FSEs to engage in an additional innovation role. The model is tested using survey and objective data from 134 FSEs. PLS results reveal that the innovation role is detrimental because sourcing knowledge from customers takes time and effort, but also beneficial because knowledge sourcing triggers FSEs to develop ideas for improvement, which positively influence their recovery speed and recovery quality. Managers can strengthen these positive effects of knowledge sourcing by optimizing an FSE's service portfolio (i.e., the combination of products, customers, and failures an employee is responsible for), which leverages the effects of knowledge sourcing on ideas for improvement.</p>"

It also controls for area and personal characteristics. Results show that commuting is positively correlated with the quality of the education-job match. However, analysis does not support the conventional wisdom that migration unambiguously reduces over-education. It seems fair to conclude that the link between migration and over-education remains unclear and that further research is needed in order to better ground policy prescriptions.</p>"

<p>Innovation processes are increasingly spreading through the unbounded universe of European small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It represents a fundamental opportunity especially for those SMEs operating in the so-called green economy' sectors, in order to be competitive in a National, European and International market with their sustainable products and services. Drawing upon a database of over 300 enterprises operating within the eight defined green sectors, this paper assesses the determinants and drawbacks of innovation. In particular, by using an econometrical approach, we tested the following propositions: (1) small dimension of enterprises is not an obstacle to their innovation capabilities; (2) the adoption of an internationalisation strategy is an opportunity and a stimulus to innovation for SMEs; (3) cooperation with research centres, financial partners, trade association and public entities can help SMEs to overcome difficulties and help them to develop and offer innovative products and services, so to be competitive at an international level. The econometric analysis shows a positive impact of the variables dimension' and level of internationalisation' on innovation capabilities. In addition, cooperation with research centres and access to capital market are positively related with effective innovations.</p>"

<p>An emerging literature stream posits that drawing on users rather than internal designers in new product creation may benefit firms because the resulting products effectively satisfy consumer needs. Four studies conducted in the context of the luxury fashion industry uncover an important conceptual boundary condition of this positive user-design effect. Contrary to extant research, the results show that being ""close"" to users does not help but rather harms luxury fashion brands. Specifically, the authors find that user design backfires because consumer demand for a given luxury fashion brand collection is reduced if the collection is labeled as user (vs. company) designed. The results further reveal the underlying rationale for this reversal: user-designed luxury products are perceived to be lower in quality and fail to signal high status, which results in a loss of agentic feelings for the consumer. The authors explore several strategies luxury brands can pursue to overcome this negative user-design effect. Finally, they find that negative outcomes of user design are attenuated for luxury fashion products that are not used for status signaling-that is, product categories of a luxury brand that are characterized by lower status relevance for the consumer.</p>"

<p>In many countries corruption is rife, despite the fact that there is a criminal-law legislative framework for corruption. Italy is one of these countries. The commitment of judges and prosecutors to combating instances of corruption is often frustrated by the consequences of the excessive length of the proceedings. The fight against corruption has been carried out mainly in the field of criminal law. The criminalisation of corruption both in domestic and in international contexts is not enough to reduce corrupt practices. In the last decade another front in the fight against corruption has been explored: the private law approach as a complement to criminal law policies. Indeed, the same corrupt practise may be subject both to criminal proceedings by public authority and to civil proceedings by the victims of corruption. The argument that private law instruments may be used in order to achieve a public policy goal is not new and goes beyond the definition of ""private enforcement"" in the context of competition law. The idea of creating a favourable social and legal background to encourage the victims of anti-competitive practices can also be transposed to the fight against corruption. In fact, in many cases of corruption the low percentage of successful criminal persecution and the class of punishment associated with corruption offences do not represent a deterrent, considering the benefits deriving from bribe. This paper aims to address the question as to whether private law remedies under national legal systems could constitute an effective disincentive against corrupt practices, alongside criminal prosecutions. The case CIR vs. Fininvest, Lodo Mondadori is one of the first cases involving damages actions resulting from corrupt practices, and addresses two of the main obstacles to civil actions in this field: evidence and the quantification of damages.</p>"

<p>The introduction of smart metering is one of the core elements in recent European policies targeting environmental sustainability and competitiveness of energy markets. Following the roll-out of smart electricity meters, in 2008 the Italian regulator designed an ambitious deployment program also for smart gas meters, that was recently modified in both scope and timing.</p>
<p>This paper assesses Italy's original and current deployment plans, with a specific focus on the results of its cost-benefit analysis. In light of the evidence derived from the literature, we observe that the case for the roll-out of smart gas meters in Italy was not supported by a strong emphasis on energy savings but rather focused on increasing efficiency of the Italian gas market; in this respect, we argue that options other than smart gas metering should also be considered. Moreover the Italian cost-benefit analysis, which mostly dealt with the potential cost savings for distributors and suppliers, led to ambiguous results in terms of net present values; thus, we believe that an updated assessment would be extremely useful. Finally, in terms of technological choices, our analysis positively evaluates the regulator's recent proposal to consider a dual-fuel solution for the mass market deployment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>Focusing on developing countries in three geographical areas (South-East Asia, Latin America and European Union), we explore the relation between political variables and tax revenue, public spending and their structure. We build a new dataset for the 1990-2005 period with fiscal, political and socio-economic variables. Since democracy is a complex and multidimensional concept, we measure it using two variables, the political strength of democratic institutions, and the protection of civil liberties. We perform three sets of estimates: (i) cross-country pooled OLS regressions with region fixed effects, (ii) country fixed effects regressions and (iii) region specific regressions with country fixed effects. While the first model delivers some significant correlations between political variables and tax items, when controlling for country fixed effects we find that tax revenue and tax composition are in general not significantly correlated with the strength of democratic institutions and the protection of civil liberties. The only exceptions are indirect, trade and property taxes. A similar result applies to public spending, with the exception of defense expenditure. Overall, our findings cast some doubt on the exact public policy channels through which political institutions affect economic development. Journal of Comparative Economics 41 (3) (2013) 684-718.

<p>We study the effect of state ownership on the market-to-book ratios of publicly traded European utilities from 1994 to 2005. We find that when the company is subject to independent regulation, state ownership seems positively associated with firm value. This relation tends to appear in countries where weak checks and balances and political fragmentation do not constrain the power of the executive. Our results suggest that, where political institutions are weak, politicians may influence regulatory agencies in order to benefit state-owned firms.

<p>In this article, we aim to portray the state of the art in public sector leadership in order to recommend directions for research and training practice. To this end, we review the scattered strands of literature on public sector leadership (PSL) and classify them in a single framework. The results of the study suggest that public sector leadership is emerging as a distinctive and autonomous domain in public administration/public management studies, although the debate is still underdeveloped compared to business administration studies. Leadership skills truly do matter in improving the performance of public sector organizations, and it is highly likely that the optimum leadership style is an integrated one: Public sector leaders should behave mainly as transformational leaders, moderately leveraging transactional relationships with their followers and heavily leveraging the importance of preserving integrity and ethics in the fulfillment of tasks. Points for practitioners</p>
<p>This study on public leadership suggests that administrative leaders in the public sector behave differently from their counterparts in the business world, and as a result there is a great need for leadership development programs which focus on these differences instead of merely mimicking programs designed for leaders in the private sector.</p>"

<p>We study whether central bank independence (CBI) and monetary policy arrangements can jointly influence the likelihood of policymakers assigning banking supervision to central banks. Our empirical analysis shows that, assuming a benevolent government, a higher degree of central bank operational (economic) independence is associated with a lower probability of supervisory powers being entrusted to the monetary authority. We interpret this result as deriving from governments' fear of the risk of excessively discretionary monetary policy. However, there is evidence that - conditional on operational independence - central banks are more involved in supervision when they pursue tighter monetary policy goals (a specific aspect of political independence). Our interpretation is that the latter may represent a commitment to mitigate central banks' discretion in the monetization of financial distress. Our study suggests that CBI can be relevant, not only for its alleged effects on macroeconomic variables, but also in influencing policymakers' decisions on the allocation of banking supervisory powers.

<p>Aim This paper used Social Exchange Theory to empirically examine whether perceived organisational support, satisfaction with training and development and perception of discretionary power are antecedents of engagement for registered nurses working in Italian public and private hospitals (n=827).</p>
<p>Background According to Social Exchange Theory, effective workplace relationships support employees and encourage nurses to use training to enhance their workplace outcomes.</p>
<p>Method This research used a cross-sectional design. Data were collected from registered nurses working in six Italian hospitals using a survey-based, self-report strategy.</p>
<p>Result Regression analysis found that the variance of process-oriented supervision accounted for 6.9% of Italian registered nurse's perception of engagement, training and development accounted for 26.8% and discretionary power accounted for 2.1%.</p>
<p>Conclusion Workplace relationships enhance autonomy and engagement. Effective workplace relationship impacts positively on nurses' outcome.</p>
<p>Implications for nursing management This paper confirms the relevance of training to enhance engagement of nurses. It also confirms the importance of workplace relationships in enhancing autonomy and engagement. Previous research has identified the importance of nurses' autonomy in an environment where there are shortages of nurses. This study confirms a similar situation for Italian nurses. The findings underline the relevance of investments in continuous professional development to enhance nurses' engagement in private and public health-care settings.</p>"

<p>European universities and public research organizations (PROs) contribute substantially to their countries' overall inventive activity, but are far from being exclusive owners of the related intellectual property. Business companies and, to a lesser extent, individuals appear to play a major, sometime dominant role. This special issue offers a selection of papers addressing issues of measurement, commercialization, and ownership of such academic patents in Europe. Measuring the extent of the phenomenon requires identification of the academic inventors, a data-mining operation that imposes technical as well as procedural challenges for social scientists. The heterogeneity of ownership models poses the question of whether ownership is related to the patents' quality and/or successful commercialization. Further questions concern the identity and business models of firms holding academic patents in their portfolios, and the economic and legal factors that explain a university's or PRO's choice of whether to maintain the intellectual property of its staff's inventions. The papers in this special issue discuss these topics at length and rely on data collected following a joint methodology, made available to readers for use and extension.</p>"

<p>Using data on patent applications at the European Patent Office, we search for trends in academic patenting in Italy, 1996-2007. During this time, Italian universities underwent a radical reform process, which granted them autonomy, and were confronted with a change in IP legislation, which introduced the professor privilege. We find that although the absolute number of academic patents has increased, (i) their weight on total patenting by domestic inventors has not, while (ii) the share of academic patents owned by universities has more than tripled. By means of a set of probit regressions, we show that the conditional probability to observe an academic patent has declined over time. We also find that the rise of university ownership is explained, significantly albeit not exclusively, by the increased autonomy of Italian universities, which has allowed them to introduce explicit IP regulations concerning their staff's inventions. The latter has effectively neutralized the introduction of the professor privilege.</p>"

<p>Innovations in supply chain (SC) management are rapidly spreading in public healthcare sectors across developed countries. In particular, healthcare managers and policymakers view SC innovation as a way to lower costs and improve quality. However, although the related rhetoric is strong, the literature provides little evidence of the benefits and performance of such SC initiatives. Above all, the literature lacks a sound conceptual framework for appraising SC management in public healthcare organisations. We argue that the public nature of healthcare and the specificities of the healthcare context require a specific theoretical approach to identifying the appropriate dimensions of SC initiatives to evaluate. Drawing from an extensive literature review and a longitudinal analysis of an inductive case study - a public hospital network developed in Tuscany (ESTAV), Italy - this work proposes a framework for assessing supply chain performance in the public healthcare sector. In addition, an empirical analysis was conducted to test the soundness and robustness of the framework, and this article presents conclusions regarding its applicability and managerial implications.</p>"

<p>The paper elaborates and tests two hypotheses. First, that knowledge is not a homogeneous activity, but rather a bundle of highly differentiated disciplines that have different characteristics, both in terms of generation and exploitation, that bear a differentiated impact on economic growth. Advances in scientific knowledge that can be converted into technological knowledge with high levels of fungibility, appropriability, cumulability and complementarity have a higher chance to affect economic growth. Second, that academic chairs are a reliable indicator of the amount and types of knowledge being generated by the academic system. Hence the analysis of the evolution of the academic chairs of an academic system is a promising area of investigation. In this paper the exploration of the evolution of the size and the disciplinary composition of the stock of academic chairs in five Italian macro-regions in the years 1900-1959 provides an opportunity to understand the contribution of scientific knowledge to economic growth in each regional system. The econometric analysis confirms that advances in engineering and chemistry, as proxied by the number of chairs, had much a stronger effect on the regional economic growth than advances in other scientific fields. These results have important implications for research policy, as they highlight the differences in the economic effects of academic disciplines, and for the economics of science, as they support the hypothesis that academic chairs can be used as reliable indicators of on-going research activities in the different types of scientific knowledge.</p>"

<p>Because the literature on platform competition emphasizes the role of network effects, it prescribes rapidly expanding a network of platform users and complementary applications to capture entire markets. We challenge the unconditional logic of a winner-take-all (WTA) approach by empirically analyzing the dominant strategies used to build and position platform systems in the U.S. video game industry. We show that when platform firms pursue two popular WTA strategies concurrently and with equal intensity (growing the number and variety of applications while also securing a larger fraction of those applications with exclusivity agreements), it diminishes the benefits of each strategy to the point that it lowers platform performance. We also show that a differentiation strategy based on distinctive positioning improves a platform's performance only when a platform system is highly distinctive relative to its rivals. Our results suggest that platform competition is shaped by important strategic trade-offs and that the WTA approach will not be universally successful.

<p>This paper presents a simulation model of industry evolution in which demand regimes and technological regimes shape the relationship between consumers switching costs and first-mover advantage. Our results show that the extent to which switching costs can be an effective mechanism in generating first-mover advantage depends on demand regimes: switching costs have a very strong impact when demand is homogeneous, and a much weaker one when demand is fragmented. The dimensions of demand regimes contribute differently to this outcome: horizontal fragmentation affects the structure of the industry, vertical fragmentation works at the firm level. Finally, the dimensions of technological regimes do not matter when demand is homogeneous; in the opposite case, they are the key determinants of the existence of advantages for early movers.

<p>Healthcare organizations are often characterized by diffuse power, ambiguous goals, and a plurality of actors. In this complex and pluralistic context, senior healthcare managers are expected to provide strategic direction and lead their organizations toward their goals and performance targets. The present work explores the relationship between senior management team culture and performance by investigating Italian public healthcare organizations in the Tuscany region. Our assessment of senior management culture was accomplished through the use of an established framework and a corresponding tool, the competing values framework, which supports the idea that specific aspects of performance are related to a dominant management culture. Organizational performance was assessed using a wide range of measures collected by a multidimensional performance evaluation system, which was developed in Tuscany to measure the performance of its 12 local health authorities (LHAs) and four teaching hospitals (THs). Usable responses were received from 80 senior managers of 11 different healthcare organizations (two THs and nine LHAs).</p>
<p>Our findings show that Tuscan healthcare organizations are characterized by various dominant cultures: developmental, clan, rational, and hierarchical. These variations in dominant culture were associated with performance measures. The implications for management theory, professional practice, and public policy are discussed.</p>"

However, past research on team improvisation has overlooked the contingencies that allow teams to effectively improvise. Drawing upon demand-control theory, we investigate how empowering leadership and overload affect the improvisation-performance relationship in the context of 48 work teams. Our results suggest that empowering leadership positively moderates the relationship between improvisation and performance, while overload attenuates the same relationship. Moreover, we found a joint effect of overload and empowering leadership influencing the improvisation-performance link, such that improvisation is most positively related to performance when empowering leadership is high and overload is low. Conversely, we found that empowering leadership is particularly detrimental to the improvisation-performance relationship when team members perceive high degrees of overload. Our findings make important contributions to the extant team literature as well as to the emerging literature on team improvisation. We outline several significant insights for HR managers and team leaders who are responsible for supporting teams that face unexpected events in the work environment.

<p>By considering pointwise maxima of independent stationary random processes with dependent Cauchy marginals, we define a new process whose univariate limit distributions are Frechet and the bivariate distributions interpolate between independence and complete dependence. The limiting dependence structure that emerges is suitable to describe dependent margins. However, we show that it is possible to enable different levels of dependence according to the magnitude of extreme events, e.g. the dependence decreases as the extremes' intensity increases. In particular, with the class of random Fields defined here, the dependence of spatial extremes can be modeled. We describe some properties of the dependence structure and we illustrate its utility in assessing the dependence. Combining marginal likelihoods through the composite likelihood approach, we are able to estimate the extremal dependence of extreme values observed in space. We convey the model's capabilities through an analysis of sea-levels recorded along the coast of the United Kingdom. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Objectives: In the Italian health care system, genetic tests for factor V Leiden and factor II are routinely prescribed to assess the predisposition to venous thromboembolism (VTE) of women who request oral contraception. With specific reference to two subpopulations of women already at risk (i.e., familial history or previous event of VIE), the study aimed to assess whether current screening practices in Italy are cost-effective. Methods: Two decisional models accrued costs and quality adjusted life-years (QALY) annually from the perspective of the National Health Service. the two models were derived from a decision analysis exercise concerning testing practices and consequent prescribing behavior for oral contraception conducted with 250 Italian gynecologists. Health care costs were compiled on the basis of 10-year hospital discharge records and the activities of a thrombosis center. Whenever possible, input data were based on the Italian context; otherwise, the data were taken from the international literature. Results: Current testing practices on women with a familial history of VIE generate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of (sic)72,412/QALY, which is well above the acceptable threshold of cost-effectiveness of (sic)40,000 to (sic)50,000/QALY. In the case of women with a previous event of V'I'E, the most frequently used testing strategy is cost-ineffective and leads to an overall loss of QALY. Conclusions: This study represents the first attempt to conduct a cost utility analysis of genetic screening practices for the predisposition to VIE in the Italian setting. the results indicate that there is an urgent need to better monitor the indications for which tests for factor V Leiden and factor II are prescribed.</p>"

<p>We use a representative and cross-country comparable sample of manufacturing firms (EFIGE) to document patterns of interaction among firm-level internationalization, innovation and productivity across seven European countries (Austria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom). We find strong evidence of positive association among the three firm-level characteristics across countries and sectors. We also find that the positive correlation between internationalization and innovation survives after controlling for productivity, with some evidence of causality running from the latter to the former. Our analysis suggests that export promotion per se is unlikely to lead to sustainable internationalization because internationalization goes beyond export and because, in the medium to long term, internationalization is likely driven by innovation. We recommend coordination and integration of internationalization and innovation policies under one roof' at both the national and EU levels, and propose a bigger coordinating role for EU institutions.</p>

We compare married individuals who divorced or separated with cohabitors whose first union ended and test the hypothesis that married individuals experience larger negative effects. Results show that initial differences are not statistically significant once the presence of children is controlled for, suggesting that the presence of children is a particularly significant source of increased psychological distress in union dissolutions. However, parenthood does not explain serious psychological distress, which appears to be associated with enduring traits (the personality trait neuroticism). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In light of this evidence, then, we take up the challenge to find a solution to this dilemma. By employing a contingency-based approach, we show that there are ways to unify the field that rely, paradoxically, on integrating the two contradictory views, while still preserving the assumptions that led to their differences.

<p>On average, prices dropped 13 % more in groups to which GRP was applied than in other groups. Moreover, each entry of a new generic was associated with a price drop of around 2.8 %. On the other hand, GRP did not induce any significant switching towards in-patent molecules.</p>

At low frequencies we identify a component correlated with long-run productivity growth and commanding a yearly premium of approximately 2%. At high frequencies we identify a component with yearly half-life, which contributes to the equity premium for another 2%. Accounting for persistence heterogeneity, we obtain an estimate of the IES strictly above one and robust across subsamples.</p>"

<p>This article describes the methodological challenges associated with disease-based international comparison of health system performance and how they have been addressed in the EuroHOPE (European Health Care Outcomes, Performance and Efficiency) project. The project uses linkable patient-level data available from national sources of Finland, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Scotland and Sweden. The data allow measuring the outcome and the use of resources in uniformly-defined patient groups using standardized risk adjustment procedures in the participating countries. The project concentrates on five important disease groups: acute myocardial infarction (AMI), ischemic stroke, hip fracture, breast cancer and very low birth weight and preterm infants (VLBWI). The essentials of data gathering, the definition of the episode of care, the developed indicators concerning baseline statistics, treatment process, cost and outcomes are described. The preliminary results indicate that the disease-based approach is attractive for international performance analyses, because it produces various measures not only at country level but also at regional and hospital level across countries. The possibility of linking hospital discharge register to other databases and the availability of comprehensive register data will determine whether the approach can be expanded to other diseases and countries.

<p>Simulation models of emissions trading performance are generally based on the assumption that carbon prices are fully (or almost fully) passed through to energy prices (with pass-through rates equal or very close to one). Unfortunately, empirical analyses of wholesale electricity spot markets do not confirm this simple rule. Pass-through rates can be much lower or much higher than one and can sharply vary over time or across countries and markets. In several cases, such rates are not significantly different from zero and can even be negative. Until now, only a few authors have tried to offer a theoretical justification for the divergence between the assumptions used in simulation models and the results of empirical evidence. The main finding of these theoretical studies is that, when the characteristics of specific energy markets (e. g., organization, vertical and horizontal structure, technology mix, firms' strategies) are adequately taken into account, the existence and degree of imperfect competition can explain why pass-through rates can vary widely and can even assume negative values. Therefore, if the models carried out to estimate the performance and costs of environmental policies are used to support policy decisions, ignoring the role of imperfect competition and the characteristics of energy markets may induce significant distortions in estimations of the impact of public action and may lead to incorrect policy calibration.</p>"

<p>In evaluating opportunities, investors wish to identify key sources of uncertainty. We propose a new way to measure how sensitive model outputs are to each probabilistic input (e.g., revenues, growth, idiosyncratic risk parameters). We base our approach on measuring the distance between cumulative distributions (risk profiles) using a metric that is invariant to monotonic transformations. Thus, the sensitivity measure will not vary by alternative specifications of the utility function over the output. To measure separation, we propose using either Kuiper's metric or Kolmogorov-Smirnov's metric. We illustrate the advantages of our proposed sensitivity measure by comparing it with others, most notably, the contribution-to-variance measures. Our measure can be obtained as a by-product of a Monte Carlo simulation. We illustrate our approach in several examples, focusing on investment analysis situations.</p>"

We find that firms with more sophisticated dynamic capabilities undertake greater amounts of activity to access resources and further develop them prior to commercial use; they also have greater success in these activities. Finally, these effects of dynamic capabilities are larger for activities directed toward initially accessing resources than those directed toward further developing them, which is consistent with the potential for firms to rely on knowledge gained through resource access activity when conducting subsequent activity to further develop resources.</p>"

<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The paper gives an update to earlier analysis considering youth poverty and transition to adulthood, which is timely given the economic crisis engulfing many countries in Europe. Whereas the crisis is affecting young people in particular, there is also a certain degree of variation across Europe.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>We document the short-term consequences of the current recession on the transition to adulthood of young Europeans, focusing on two main cornerstones in the transition to adulthood: economic independence and residential autonomy.</p>
<p>METHODS</p>
<p>We use a combination of OECD Employment Statistics for 2012 and micro-level data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) for the period 2005-2011 for 24 countries.</p>
<p>RESULTS</p>
<p>We document an increase in economic hardship experienced by young adults in several European countries during the recession, which is starting to translate into higher rates of co-residence with parents, hence delaying the process of leaving home and gaining economic independence.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
<p>The way countries are reacting to the recession is not yet clear-cut, but economic uncertainty and deprivation is on the rise in those countries hardest hit, which is likely to delay the key markers of transition to adulthood.</p>"

<p>Historical cost accounting deals with uncertainty by deferring the recognition of earnings until the uncertainty has largely been resolved. Such accounting affects both earnings and book value and produces expected earnings growth deemed to be at risk. This paper shows that the earnings-to-price and book-to-price ratios that are the product of this accounting forecast both earnings growth and the risk to that growth. The paper also shows that the market pricing of earnings and book values in these ratios aligns with the risk imbedded in the accounting: the returns to buying stocks on the basis of their earnings yield and book-to-price are explained as a rational pricing of the risk of expected earnings growth not being realized. Accordingly, the paper provides a rationalization of the well-documented book-to-price effect in stock returns: book-to-price indicates the risk in buying earnings growth. However, growth identified by a high book-to-price as yielding a higher return in this paper is quite different from ""growth"" typically attributed to a low book-to-price as yielding a lower return. Accordingly, the notion of ""growth"" versus ""value"" requires modification.</p>"

<p>This paper develops a theoretical framework for analyzing the strategic interaction between Islamists - pragmatic and dogmatic - and the regime when Shari'a-based issues are negotiated. I advance the new notion that pragmatists might be responsive to the Islamist electorate. Within the framework I generate the hypothesis that, if the regime promotes substantive reforms and the Islamist electorate supports them, then the internal cohesiveness of Islamist parties is weakened. In the case of Family Code reforms in Morocco, empirical analysis confirms that Islamists' change of strategy in 2003 - from opposing to not opposing the reforms - was due to changed preferences within the electorate in favour of reform. This change in preferences was matched by deep divisions within the Islamists of the Parti de la Justice et du Developpement and had dramatic repercussions upon the internal cohesiveness of the party.</p>"

In this study, we apply a life-cycle methodology to assess the environmental impacts associated with extra-virgin olive oil production. The results of LCA were used to set the environmental requirements of a local product qualification scheme defined according to the National Protocol (QUAM - Qualita Ambientale), signed by two Italian Ministries and four Regional Governments, on the environmental qualification of cluster products. Using the three performance indicators taken from the LCA study and two input indicators, we defined a set of entry level requirements which each local producer must comply with in order to achieve the qualification.</p>"

In this research we conducted an ethnographic study of wiki implementation to understand why some people chose to use the systems and others did not.

We found that certain norms and premises at the industry, organisational and sub-unit level appear to influence decisions to use the wiki. This study contributes to the knowledge management literature by demonstrating the role of institutional scripts in decisions to use this software for knowledge sharing.

<p>Much evidence indicates that emotion enhances memory, but the precise effects of the two primary factors of arousal and valence remain at issue. Moreover, the current knowledge of emotional memory enhancement is based mostly on small samples of extremely emotive stimuli presented in unnaturally high proportions without adequate affective, lexical, and semantic controls. To investigate how emotion affects memory under conditions of natural variation, we tested whether arousal and valence predicted recognition memory for over 2500 words that were not sampled for their emotionality, and we controlled a large variety of lexical and semantic factors. Both negative and positive stimuli were remembered better than neutral stimuli, whether arousing or calming. Arousal failed to predict recognition memory, either independently or interactively with valence. Results support models that posit a facilitative role of valence in memory. This study also highlights the importance of stimulus controls and experimental designs in research on emotional memory. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This paper characterizes when joint financing of two projects through debt increases expected default costs, contrary to conventional wisdom. Separate financing dominates joint financing when risk-contamination losses-that are associated with the contagious default of a well-performing project that is dragged down by the other project's poor performance-outweigh standard coinsurance gains. Separate financing becomes more attractive than joint financing when the fraction of returns lost under default increases and when projects have lower mean returns, higher variability, more positive correlation, and more negative skewness. These predictions are broadly consistent with evidence on conglomerate mergers, spinoffs, project finance, and securitization.</p>"

<p>The World Trade Organization (WTO) system of 'prospective' or 'forward-looking' remedies is often contrasted negatively with the 'retrospective' remedy of reparation traditionally granted by international courts. In this article, I argue that prospective remedies must be assessed having in mind their different functions when contrasted to reparation: inducing compliance ex post, rather than discouraging it ex ante. The object and purpose of WTO remedies is to ensure cessation within a reasonable period of time or, in the absence of cessation, to allow alternative legal responses by the organization and its members until compliance is achieved. Although it would be beyond the current powers of WTO adjudicators to grant reparation, this does not exhaust the possibilities of 'retrospective' remedies. When making use of the remedies provided for in the Dispute Settlement Understanding, panels, the Appellate Body and arbitrators must take into account the ultimate objective of WTO remedies in order to ensure that the absence of reparation does not imply an absence of legal consequences.</p>"

<p>This paper proposes an extension to Global Vector Autoregressive (GVAR) models to capture time-varying interdependence among financial variables. Government bond spreads in the euro area feature a time-varying pattern of co-movement that poses a serious challenge for econometric modelling and forecasting. This pattern of the data is not captured by the standard specification that model spreads as persistent processes reverting to a time-varying mean determined by two factors: a local factor, driven by fiscal fundamentals and growth, and a global world factor, driven by the market's appetite for risk. This paper argues that a third factor, expectations of exchange rate devaluation, gained traction during the crises. This factor is well captured via a GVAR that models the interdependence among spreads by making each country's spread function of global European spreads. Global spreads capture the exposure of each country's spread to other spreads in the euro area in terms of the time-varying 'distance' between their fiscal fundamentals. This new specification dominates the standard one in modelling the time-varying pattern of co-movements among spreads and the response of euro area spreads to the Greek debt crisis.

<p>The financial crisis has affected the landscape of the banking sector around the world. We use a sample of transactions carried out by European acquirers in 2007-2010 to study the acquirer's stock price market reaction to both announcements and completions of acquisitions. At the aggregate level, we find that there are no significant abnormal returns around the announcement of an acquisition while there are positive abnormal returns at completions. We study the cross-sectional determinants of abnormal returns and find that announcement returns are mainly explained by the acquirer bank characteristics, while completion returns mainly depend on opacity of the target and on the drop in idiosyncratic volatility associated with a reduction of uncertainty.

<p>Supervisory stress tests assess the impact of an adverse macroeconomic scenario on the profitability and capitalisation of a large number of banks. The results of such stress test exercises have recently been disclosed to the public in an attempt to restore confidence and to curb bank opaqueness by helping investors distinguish between sound and fragile institutions. In an unprecedented effort for transparency, the 2011 European Union stress test lead to the release of some 3400 data points for each of the 90 participating banks. This makes it an ideal setting to investigate a number of hypotheses on the information role of the stress tests.</p>
<p>In this paper we examine the 2011 European stress test exercise to assess whether and how it affected bank stock prices. Our event study analysis shows that the test's results were considered relevant by investors. The market did not simply look at the detailed historical data which was released after the tests, but also attached considerable importance to variables measuring each bank's vulnerability to the simulated downturn scenario. The latter include proxies for liquidity risk and model risk. Information on sovereign debt holdings, while affecting market reaction on a univariate basis, is not statistically significant in a multivariate setting. We also find that the market is not able to anticipate the test results and this is consistent with the idea of greater bank opaqueness prior to the disclosure of the stress test results. Overall, our analysis shows that stress tests produce valuable information for market participants and can play a role in mitigating bank opacity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>In 1994 the regulatory framework of water services in Italy was radically modified, by transforming a traditional publicly operated system, which relied heavily for investments on fiscal budgets, into a system made up of self-sustaining corporate enterprises regulated at arm's length. After 19 years, the time has come to make an assessment of what has been achieved. This paper develops an original methodology, inspired by the concept of water sustainability, which tries to integrate economic, environmental and financial aspects within a unique framework. Our analysis discloses both allocative as well as distributive impacts of the reform, showing that it has been possible to generate some value for money while shifting the economic burden from taxpayers to service customers.

<p>Authorship and inventorship are ""attribution rights"" upon which individual scientists build their reputation and career. Social and legal norms concerning their distribution within research teams are currently criticized for failing to inform third parties on individual contributions. We examine the case of teams engaged in the ""double disclosure"" of their research results through both publications and patents, and model the negotiation process taking place between junior or female team members and the senior (male) ones. We suggest that the former may give up inventorship in order to secure authorship, even when entitled to the both. Based on a sample of 680 ""patent-publication pairs"" (related sets of patents and publications) we show that, very frequently, one or more authors of a publication do not appear as inventors of a related patent. This is less likely to happen for first and last authors, which is in accordance both with our model and the prevailing legal norms on inventorship. However, the probability of exclusion from inventorship also declines with seniority, and increases for women, which is compatible with our model only. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

<p>Regulatory schema has shifted from government to governance-based systems. One particular form that has emerged at the international level is the multi-stakeholder voluntary code of conduct (MSVC). We argue that such codes are not only simply mechanisms by which various stakeholders attempt to govern the action of the corporation but also systems by which each stakeholder attempts to gain or retain some legitimacy goal. Each stakeholder is motivated by strategic legitimacy goal to join the code, and once a member, is also required to assist in maintaining the institutional legitimacy of the code, resulting in ""networked legitimacy."" We begin our analysis of these systems by first exploring the growth and structure of such MSVCs, and then building an analytical framework using strategic and institutional legitimacy as they apply to such MSVCs. We contribute to the codes of conduct literature by developing the construct of networked legitimacy from strategic and institutional legitimacy. We then apply our framework to the United Nations Global Compact, one of the predominant MSVCs today. In doing so, we: (1) demonstrate how different stakeholders are pursuing different types of legitimacy through their participation in the code, (2) examine the specific opportunities and risks in terms of what we have called ""networked legitimacy"" posed by the institutional design of actual MSVCs, and (3) create an argument for three pillars supporting the legitimacy of MSVCs.</p>"

<p>Academics do not turn to managers for inspiration for their research and managers do not consult academics on theories to develop models and strategies. The resulting issue of the non-relevance of research in this field is so controversial that it could limit the development of management studies. The problem, however, cannot be eliminated by simply calling for research on more relevant topics or hoping for greater collaboration between researchers and managers. The absence of a solution to this problem is not due to the unwillingness or lack of intelligence of researchers, but because science must be closed to external demands and therefore also to the managerial world. In this paper, I argue that the solution is not in opposing this closure, but incorporating it within a research and practice eco-system that sets out from the fact that non-relevance is not only a problem of the scientific community, but also of the managerial world: they have a problem too.</p>"

<p>Objective: To investigate the organisation and decision-making processes of regional and local therapeutic committees in Italy, as a case-study of decentralised health care systems.</p>
<p>Methods: A structured questionnaire was designed, validated, and self-administered to respondents. Committee members, prioritisation, assessment process and criteria, and transparency of committees were investigated.</p>
<p>Results: The respondents represent 100% of the 17 regional committees out of 21 regions (in 4 regions there is not any regional formulary), 88% of the 16 hospital networks and 42% of the 183 public hospitals. The assessment process appears fragmented and may take a long time: drugs inclusion into hospital formularies requires two steps in most regions (regional and local assessment). Most of the therapeutic committees are closed to industry and patients associations involvement. Prioritisation in the assessment is mostly driven by disease severity, clinical evidence, and the absence of therapeutic alternatives. Only 13 out of the 17 regional committees have a public application form for drugs inclusion into regional formulary. Regional and local committees (i) often re-assess the clinical evidence already evaluated at central level and (ii) mostly rely on comparative drug unit prices per DDD and drug budget impact. The level of transparency is quite low.</p>
<p>Conclusions: The Italian case-study provides useful insights into an appropriate management of multi-tier drugs assessment, which is particularly complex in decentralised health care systems, but exists also in centralised systems where drugs are assessed by local therapeutic committees. A clear definition of regulatory competences at different levels, a higher collaboration between central, regional and local actors, and increased transparency are necessary to pursue consistency between central policies on price and reimbursement and budget accountability at the regional and local levels.

<p>We investigate how the credit cycle affects the link between bond spreads and credit ratings. Using a simple model of the credit assessment process, we show that when the debt market is more opaque, the information content of ratings deteriorates, creating an incentive for investors to increase the amount spent on private information. We test this hypothesis empirically. Results show that when market opaqueness (proxied by the spread between Aaa- and Baa-rated bonds) increases, the explanatory power of ratings and other control variables deteriorates as investors increasingly price in non-public information.

<p>Since the mid-1990s worldwide efforts were undertaken to improve the effectiveness of financial supervision, through modifications in the architecture and governance. Did these improvements mitigate the 2008-2009 Crisis? This paper brings the first systematic analysis of the role of three main efforts: consolidation in supervision, decreasing central bank involvement and improving supervisory governance. The analysis employs a new and complex database on supervisory architecture and governance for 102 countries and uses two new indicators to evaluate the supervisory regime: the Financial Supervision Herfindahl Hirschman (FSHH) and the Central Bank Supervisor Share (CBSS) Indexes. The empirical tests allow us to disentangle the relative effects of the supervisory regimes on macroeconomic resilience. We conclude that two supervisory features-supervisory consolidation and supervisory governance-were negatively correlated with resilience, while central bank involvement in supervision did not have any significant impact. Our results show that the conditions under which micro-features of the supervisory design produce automatically macro-optimal outcomes are far from identified, and consequently contradict what was the generally accepted view before the crisis.

<p>Background: To better understand how stock-outs of the first line antimalarial, Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) and other non-compliant health worker behaviour, influence household expenditures during care-seeking for fever in the Ulanga District in Tanzania.</p>
<p>Methods: We combined weekly ACT stock data for the period 2009-2011 from six health facilities in the Ulanga District in Tanzania, together with household data from 333 respondents on the cost of fever care-seeking in Ulanga during the same time period to establish how health seeking behaviour and expenditure might vary depending on ACT availability in their nearest health facility.</p>
<p>Results: Irrespective of ACT stock-outs, more than half (58%) of respondents sought initial care in the public sector, the remainder seeking care in the private sector where expenditure was higher by 19%. Over half (54%) of respondents who went to the public sector reported incidences of non-compliant behaviour by the attending health worker (e. g. charging those who were eligible for free service or referring patients to the private sector despite ACT stock), which increased household expenditure per fever episode from USD0.14 to USD1.76. ACT stock-outs were considered to be the result of non-compliant behaviour of others in the health system and increased household expenditure by 21%; however we lacked sufficient statistical power to confirm this finding.</p>
<p>Conclusion: System design and governance challenges in the Tanzanian health system have resulted in numerous ACT stock-outs and frequent non-compliant public sector health worker behaviour, both of which increase out-of-pocket health expenditure. Interventions are urgently needed to ensure a stable supply of ACT in the public sector and increase health worker accountability.</p>"

<p>Much progress has been made recently in developing the business model concept. However, one issue remains poorly understood, despite its importance for managers, policy makers, and academics alike, namely, how companies change and develop their business models to achieve sustained value creation. Companies which manage to create value over extended periods of time successfully shape, adapt and renew their business models to fuel such value creation. Drawing on findings from a research program on continuously growing firms, this paper identifies three critical capabilities, namely an orientation towards experimenting with and exploiting new business opportunities; a balanced use of resources; as well as achieving coherence between leadership, culture, and employee commitment, together shaping key strategizing actions. Moreover, we illustrate how each of these capabilities is supported by different sets of specific activities. Jointly, these three capabilities, their activities and the strategizing actions act as complementarities for value creation. We conclude the paper by suggesting implications for research and practitioners, providing a tool for managers which allows them to reflect on and identify critical issues relevant for changing and developing their business model to sustain value creation.

<p>We estimate the effect of a road pricing policy introduced in Milan in 2068 on concentrations of benzene, carbon monoxide, particulates, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide. We found a sizeable effect of the Ecopass on air quality in terms of reduction in the concentration of carbon monoxide and particulates a few days after its introduction, although this effect disappeared after only one week. We interpret these results as indicative of an inefficient policy design: motorbikes were not charged and the treated area is too limited to generate positive outcomes for the whole city. Further evidence from a natural experiment given by a temporary suspension of the charge in 2012 confirms our hypothesis on the incentives for motorbike usage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>This paper looks at a little-explored role that universities can play: that of representing a channel for brain gain, enabling regions to attract bright students who may decide to stay after they have graduated. In this way, universities can be a source of selective migration processes and possibly of diverging development paths, by augmenting the capability of economically dynamic regions to attract bright people from the lagging regions. In this paper, we argue that student mobility behaviour is a function not only of the quality of universities, but also of local labour market conditions in the destination locations. The paper relies on a gravity model, and shows that graduate migrations respond to several determinants, among which graduate job vacancies (that is, the dynamism of the local labour market) appear to be essential.</p>"

<p>A further generalization of an economic growth model is the main topic of this paper. The paper specifically analyzes the effects on the asymptotic dynamics of the Solow model when two time delays are inserted: the time employed in order that the capital is used for production and the necessary time so that the capital is depreciated. The existence of a unique nontrivial positive steady state of the generalized model is proved and sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability are established. Moreover, the existence of a Hopf bifurcation is proved and, by using the normal form theory and center manifold argument, the explicit formulas which determine the stability, direction, and period of bifurcating periodic solutions are obtained. Finally, numerical simulations are performed for supporting the analytical results.</p>"

<p>This paper deals with one of the pillars of contemporary business history - the use of cross-national comparisons. Besides the longitudinal, the comparative perspective is a crucial dimension of business and economic history research. During the last decades several attempts have been made to illustrate the process of development and structuring of national markets and corporations both currently and in a historical perspective, through the use of a comparative method. This paper aims to point out the possibilities and problems with this approach. It especially highlights the role of institutional factors and changes as important determinants for national development and as obstacles for good comparative exercises. It also discusses the role of functional and coherent definitions in comparative research and the problems connected with data collection and analysis. The main research question is how cross-national comparisons can help us develop business history research further. A comparison between family firms in Italy and Sweden shows that the development of family business in these two countries exhibited extensive similarities during the early decades of the twentieth century. However after World War II the two countries became more diversified in terms of their industrial structure. While Swedish family firms became an important part of national big business, Italian family businesses developed into smaller and more flexible organisations. Thus, today in Sweden several family-owned and controlled firms are among the largest in the country, particularly in capital- and technology-intensive industries. Italian family firms, even if present among the largest in the country, are largely in industries other than high tech, and show a degree of organisational sophistication inferior to their Swedish counterparts. This paper discusses the driving forces behind this development, showing how the explicit use of the comparative, longitudinal approach can highlight the patterns of convergence and divergence across national business models.</p>"

<p>Children with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first complete remission can benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We analyzed the outcome of 211 children with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first complete remission who were given an allogeneic transplant between 1990 and 2008; the outcome of patients who, despite having an indication for transplantation and a suitable donor, did not receive the allograft for different reasons in the same time period was not analyzed. Sixty-nine patients (33%) were transplanted between 1990 and 1999, 58 (27%) between 2000 and 2005, and 84 (40%) between 2005 and 2008. A matched family donor was employed in 138 patients (65%) and an unrelated donor in 73 (35%). The 10-year probabilities of overall and disease-free survival were 63.4% and 61%, respectively. The 10-year cumulative incidences of transplantation-related mortality and relapse were 15% and 24%, respectively. After 1999, no differences in either disease-free survival or transplant-related mortality were observed in patients transplanted from unrelated or matched family donors. In multivariate analysis, grade IV acute graft-versus-host disease was an independent factor associated with worse disease-free survival. By contrast, grade I acute graft-versus-host disease and age at diagnosis between 1 and 9 years were favorable prognostic variables. Our study, not intended to evaluate whether transplantation is superior to chemotherapy for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first complete remission and high-risk features, shows that the allograft cured more than 60% of these patients; in the most recent period, the outcome of recipients of grafts from matched family and unrelated donors was comparable.</p>"

<p>This paper aims at discussing the entry process and competitive strategies of MVNOs in Italy and France. It illustrates the features of competition in a sector - the mobile telecom service industry - which is characterized by market saturation and demand heterogeneity. In doing so, it looks at the characteristics of the two countries in terms of competition and entry of new operators, at the motivations behind the entry of MVNOs, and at the performance of different companies. Results show that the most successful MVNOs are those characterized by the ability to find a perfect match between their core competencies (large network management, strong brand reputation) and the needs of specific segments of demand that had not been previously fulfilled. In this context, companies with ICT network management skills, whether coming from the telecom sector or from other network-based service industries such as postal operators, have been particularly successful in the market. From a policy perspective, despite the failure of some MVNOs, customers have benefited from the increased competition between MNOs and MVNOs in terms of range of service offerings and prices.

Second, it surveys the various mechanisms linking financial shocks to employment adjustment, developing a new theory of the effects of leverage on job creation and destruction. Third, it presents evidence coherent with one of such mechanisms, notably with the prediction that more leveraged firms experience larger job destruction during financial recessions, controlling for the scale of output falls.</p>"

<p>In this paper we argue that tax enforcement is an additional contextual factor affecting tax morale, one of the most important determinants of tax compliance. By using a unique dataset that merges a representative sample of Italian households with administrative data on tax enforcement, we first find that tax morale is positively correlated with tax enforcement. Second, to deal with possible endogeneity of tax enforcement, we show that results are confirmed in an IV specification using the change in the tax gap at the provincial level as an instrument for tax enforcement. Finally, we provide evidence that the impact of tax enforcement and social environment is stronger at low quantiles of tax morale. Our results show that besides that of lowering the expected value of tax evasion, tax enforcement has an additional and indirect effect on tax compliance through its effect on tax morale.

<p>We analyze forward-induction reasoning in games with asymmetric information assuming some commonly understood restrictions on beliefs. Specifically, we assume that some given restrictions. on players' initial or conditional first-order beliefs are transparent, that is, not only do the restrictions. hold but there is also common belief in. at every node. Most applied models of asymmetric information are covered as special cases whereby. pins down the probabilities initially assigned to states of nature. But the abstract analysis also allows for transparent restrictions on beliefs about behavior, e. g. independence restrictions or restrictions induced by the context behind the game. Our contribution is twofold. First, we use dynamic interactive epistemology to formalize assumptions that capture foward-induction reasoning given the transparency of., and show that the behavioral implications of these assumptions are characterized by the Delta-rationalizability solution procedure of Battigalli (1999, 2003). Second, we study the differences and similarities between this solution concept and a simpler solution procedure put forward by Battigalli and Siniscalchi (2003). We show that the two procedures are equivalent if. is ""closed under compositions"" a property that holds in all the applications considered by Battigalli and Siniscalchi (2003). We also show that when. is not closed under compositions, the simpler solution procedure of Battigalli and Siniscalchi (2003) may fail to characterize the behavioral implications of forward-induction reasoning.</p>"

<p>This paper examines the relationship between the institutional environment and sustained corporate illegality. We find that cognitive assumptions generate expectations that can, under specific circumstances, induce organizations to amplify illegal actions and that serve to lessen regulatory scrutiny. We also find that, once initiated, illegal actions can become hidden because of institutionalized practices that enable their concealment and that weaken the prospect of detection. These processes and effects are particularly noticeable in networks of professional regulators who become mutually over-confident and over-influenced by each other to the extent that their independent critical assessments and judgements are compromised. Mechanisms of mimetic herding and social humiliation compromise independence of judgement. Networks of interacting professionals are thus vulnerable to a collectively induced lowering of regulatory vigilance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) increases the risk of systemic thromboembolic events; therefore, anticoagulant treatment with vitamin K antagonists is widely prescribed. Recently, new oral anticoagulants (NOAs) directly inhibiting thrombin (dabigatran) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban and apixaban) demonstrated their non-inferiority with respect to warfarin in reducing the thromboembolic risk. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of NOAs in an Italian setting.</p>
<p>A Markov decision model including ten health states and death was developed, and a 3-month Markov cycle and lifetime horizon were adopted. Transition probabilities and quality of life were estimated from three randomized trials and from additional reports in the literature. Analysis was performed in the context of the Italian National Health System. First- and second-order sensitivity analyses were made to test the robustness of the results.

<p>The incremental cost-utility ratio was below a,not sign25,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for each NOA and each CHADS(2) level, but differences among drugs were found. This result was sensitive to the time in (warfarin) therapeutic range and time horizon.</p>

In order to do this, we first consider the creative, organizational activity that leads to the actual set up of exhibitions and festivals so as to identify the diverse phases and the respective outcomes of such planning activity. The outcome that is more likely to access copyright protection is the result of the advanced planning activity, that is, that project that comprises all the elements of the future exhibition or festival. Given the nature of 'schemes' that exhibitions and festivals reveal, we then draw a parallel with television formats, as the works that more fully evoke such projects and whose copyrightability is equally controversial. We conclude by assessing whether, in principle, copyright protection is available for art exhibition projects as well as for the projects that are at the core of the diverse kind of arts festivals currently employed to make art more accessible to the public.</p>"

In this article, we provide a contribution to the literature and empirical evidence by focusing on a new form of direct regulation introduced by the European Union: the Integrated Pollution Prevention Control regulation. By using data from different sources, we performed ordered probit regression and found that the design of Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control permit provides a positive impulse for increasing investments and, as a consequence, produces positive effects on performance at the facility level. Our study clearly shows that direct regulation can have a strong and significant effect on performance, but it depends on how it is designed. The main managerial implication stemming from our work is the need to properly design approaches and tools for direct regulations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Within changing value networks, the profits and competitive advantages of participation reside dynamically at control points that are the positions of greatest value and/or power. The enterprises that hold these positions have a great deal of control over how the network operates, how the benefits are redistributed, and how this influences the execution of a digital business strategy. This article is based on a field study that provides preliminary, yet promising, empirical evidence that sheds light on the dynamic cycle of value creation and value capture points in digitally enabled networks in response to triggers related to technology and business strategy. The context used is that of the European and U. S. broadcasting industry. Specifically, the paper illustrates how incremental innovations may shift value networks from static, vertically integrated networks to more loosely coupled networks, and how cross-boundary industry disruptions may then, in turn, shift those to two-sided markets.

This note discusses a few representative papers that try to better understand the value of patented inventions. It deals with three topics: the value of patent rights, the value of patents as quality signals, and the value of patented inventions as a whole. In the latter case, it focuses on the creation of value through the number of inventions produced rather than increase in the value of individual invention. The note also sketches open questions for future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Integrative priming is the facilitated recognition of a target word following a prime word with which it can be combined to produce a sub-type of the target (e.g., a lake bird is a type of bird). Such priming occurs even in the absence of lexical association, semantic similarity, or compound familiarity and so poses a challenge to current models of priming. The present research establishes integrative priming as a robust phenomenon across paradigms and tests whether it occurs controllably or uncontrollably. Target words (e.g., ""bird"") were preceded by a prime word that was integratable (e.g., ""lake""), associated and similar (e.g., ""canary""), or unrelated (e.g., ""trial""). Integrative priming was observed in a perceptual identification task that minimised strategic processing (Experiment 1) and in a Stroop colour naming task that penalised lexical integration (Experiment 2). Thus, like associative priming, integrative priming occurred uncontrollably. The results necessitate a distinct model of integrative priming, in which priming occurs automatically.

<p>This paper studies the growth patterns in knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) in Lombardy on the basis of original firm-level survey data. The aim is to investigate in particular the role of and interplay between age and size of firms and the modes of innovation in the process of growth. Our findings indicate that younger firms tend to outperform incumbents for sales growth and that larger firms tend to grow more than smaller companies. However, the effects of firm size and age vary substantially according to the firm's specific pattern of innovation. In particular, highly innovative firms tend to outperform competitors regardless of their age or size, while for conservative KIBS, size is a prerequisite for growth. Investment in human capital and the service distribution network are important drivers of competition for growing KIBS.</p>"

<p>Among the innovations accompanying the transformation of GATT into the WTO was the remarkable strengthening of multilateral institutions. While the paradigmatic change brought about by the institutionalization of the multilateral trading system has been generally acknowledged, its impact on WTO law-making has been largely overlooked. Much of the debate has concentrated on whether and to what extent ` external' international legal rules should be taken into account by WTO adjudicators. An analysis of the WTO jurisprudence, however, evidences a different approach. The interpretation (and, to some extent, modification) of WTO rules depends not on the bilateral relations between the parties to a particular dispute, which may affect the application as between them of the multilateral rules, but on the establishment -through subsequent agreement, subsequent practice, or broader normative evolution -of a ` common understanding' of the membership. Once established, a new interpretation is not limited to the context of a particular dispute, but affects the WTO rights and obligations of all members. As a result, the bilateral logic that ordinarily determines legal relations between states based on individual consent gives way to a multilateral logic, which allows a degree of normative change while preserving the integrity of the WTO legal system.</p>"

<p>We present a theory of context-dependent choice in which a consumer's attention is drawn to salient attributes of goods, such as quality or price. An attribute is salient for a good when it stands out among the good's attributes relative to that attribute's average level in the choice set (or, more broadly, the choice context). Consumers attach disproportionately high weight to salient attributes, and their choices are tilted toward goods with higher quality/price ratios. The model accounts for a variety of disparate evidence, including decoy effects and context-dependent willingness to pay. It also suggests a novel theory of misleading sales.</p>"

We compare brain activity of entrepreneurs (who currently manage the organization they founded based on their venture idea) and managers (who are constantly involved in making strategic decisions but have no venture experience) engaged in a gambling-task assessing exploitative vs. explorative decision-making. Compared with managers, entrepreneurs showed higher decision-making efficiency, and a stronger activation in regions of frontopolar cortex (FPC) previously associated with explorative choice.

<p>The rapid increase in courses dealing with cross-cultural management (CCM), brought about by economies' globalization and increased workforce mobility motivated us to examine the impact of cross-cultural management courses on cultural intelligence. Cultural intelligence (CQ) refers to individual's abilities and skills to effectively manage interactions in cross-cultural situations. It includes four dimensions: metacognitive, cognitive, motivational and behavioral. In two multinational longitudinal studies using matched samples and pre-postintervention measures, we assessed the effects of academic CCM courses on students' CQ. We found that after the courses, students' overall CQ was significantly higher than at Time 1. No effects on CQ were detected in the control group, where students worked in multicultural settings but did not take a CCM course. Cross-cultural management courses had stronger effects on metacognitive and cognitive CQ than on motivational and behavioral CQ. We found an interesting pattern regarding students' international experience: While international experience in Time 1 positively related to students' CQ, at Time 2, this relationship became nonsignificant (Study 1). These findings contribute to understanding the antecedents of cultural intelligence and how educational interventions affect it, with practical implications for designing and developing international management education and training programs.</p>"

<p>To assess patient preferences for psoriasis treatment features and to investigate the heterogeneity of preferences among patients with different socio-demographic and disease-related characteristics.</p>
<p>A discrete choice experiment was conducted on adult patients with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis during a routine visit to their physician at 15 centres in Italy. We investigated the preferences of patients with respect to five treatment attributes: (1) mode and frequency of administration; (2) time to improvement; (3) time free of symptoms; (4) unintended life expectancy reduction resulting from treatment; and (5) monthly treatment cost. The heterogeneity of preferences was investigated in a mixed logit model with normally distributed random coefficients.</p>
<p>Overall, patients preferred the subcutaneous or intravenous route of administration (versus oral administration) and treatments that took less time to show improvement, ensured a longer time free of symptoms, involved a lesser reduction in life expectancy and had lower costs. There was significant preference heterogeneity for all attributes. The cost attribute was found to be significantly more important to females and to older patients (above 60 years of age). Older patients placed significantly greater emphasis on reduced life expectancy, whereas the time free of symptoms was significantly less important to them than to patients under 60 years of age. Patients with higher scores on the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) placed higher value on the time free of symptoms than those with lower DLQI scores. For the overall sample, the marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for a month's reduction in the time to improvement was a,not sign32.4, whereas the WTP for one additional month without symptoms was significantly higher (a,not sign68.2).</p>

<p>This study investigates the nonobvious interrelationship between slack resources and radical innovation. While organizational slack and innovation literature has implicitly recognized a link between these constructs, at least two important aspects of their relationship have been overlooked. First, little attention has been paid to the mechanisms by which slack resources become beneficial for radical innovation. Drawing on information search and organizational learning theories, we propose distal search activitysearching for information outside the current knowledge domain of the firmas a mediating variable between slack resources and radical innovation. Second, little consideration has been given to the strategic orientation of the firm as the context in which slack resources are deployed to enhance radical innovation. Adopting Miles and Snow's typology of strategic archetypes, we propose a moderating role of strategy in the slack resources-distal search-radical innovation chain of relations. We tested our hypotheses on a sample of Chinese high-technology firms, using multiple informant survey data and regression analysis. Our results indicate that slack resources are positively related to radical innovation, and that this relationship is partially mediated by distal search. Thus, there appear to be two routes (one direct, one indirect) to transform slack resources into radical innovation. Further, moderation analysis shows that the effect of slack resources on distal search is strongest among analyzers, while the effect of distal search on radical innovation is strongest among defenders. In sum, our results suggest that analyzers are relatively more dependent on the amount of slack resources compared to other strategy types, that is, resource constraints would have a more negative effect on analyzers. We discuss theoretical and managerial implications of our study and conclude by suggesting future research opportunities.</p>"

<p>Normal individual differences are rarely considered in the modelling of visual word recognition - with item response time effects and neuropsychological disorders being given more emphasis - but such individual differences can inform and test accounts of the processes of reading. We thus had 100 participants read aloud words selected to assess theoretically important item response time effects on an individual basis. Using two major models of reading aloud - DRC and CDP+ - we estimated numerical parameters to best model each individual's response times to see if this would allow the models to capture the effects, individual differences in them and the correlations among these individual differences. It did not. We therefore created an alternative model, the DRC-FC, which successfully captured more of the correlations among individual differences, by modifying the locus of the frequency effect. Overall, our analyses indicate that (i) even after accounting for individual differences in general speed, several other individual difference in reading remain significant; and (ii) these individual differences provide critical tests of models of reading aloud. The database thus offers a set of important constraints for future modelling of visual word recognition, and is a step towards integrating such models with other knowledge about individual differences in reading.

<p>Integrated assessment models offer a crucial support to decisionmakers in climate policy making. For a full understanding and corroboration of model results, analysts ought to identify the exogenous variables that influence the model results the most (key drivers), appraise the relevance of interactions, and the direction of change associated with the simultaneous variation of uncertain variables. We show that such information can be directly extracted from the data set produced by Monte Carlo simulations. Our discussion is guided by the application to the well-known DICE model of William Nordhaus. The proposed methodology allows analysts to draw robust insights into the dependence of future atmospheric temperature, global emissions, and carbon costs and taxes on the model's exogenous variables.</p>"

With non-contingent nominal deposit contracts, a decentralized banking system can achieve the first-best efficient allocation if the central bank accommodates the demands of the private sector for fiat money. Price level variations allow full sharing of aggregate risks. An interbank market allows the sharing of idiosyncratic liquidity risk. In contrast, idiosyncratic (bank-specific) return risks cannot be shared using monetary policy alone as real transfers are needed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>The article addresses two principal questions: how public management reforms develop in a context of high government turnover, and how, under these circumstances, features of the specific area of public management policy affect the dynamics of the reform and in particular its ""technical feasibility."" The research questions are addressed through the case study of the Italian administrative context between 1992 and 2007, a period marked by tumultuous government turnovers. The article presents reforms in two policy areas of public management: civil service reform and innovation, over a three-period time span covering 15 years. The brief duration of political leadership represents a threat to the approval and implementation of policy interventions irrespective of the political salience of the issue and the need for legal enactment. Therefore, the success of a public management reform process in an unstable political context characterized by frequent government turnovers depends on meeting certain conditions for successful policy entrepreneurship: the a priori expertise of policy entrepreneurs, their ability to repackage the issue, keep a community of practice alive, and maneuver the dynamics of the legal process. However, implementation, being a less visible phase, suffers from greater discontinuity as ""maintenance activities"" necessary for the success of reform are disregarded. Thus, the consideration of the temporal dimension of the policy cycle and the area-specific effects on public management reform dynamics exerted by diverse levels of political salience and legal enactment represent the main contributions of this work to the theories on public management policy change.</p>"

<p>Trademarks protecting the brand name and associations are crucial in a brand's strategy, but little is known about the factors that determine a trademark's prolongation. To explain the prolongation of trademarks, the research estimated a multilevel hazard model accounting for trademark characteristics, firm's characteristics, and firm's country of origin national culture. The dataset comprises a census of 2911 trademarks in the US software security industry across an eight-year period, belonging to firms originating from 11 countries. The results indicate that a firm's culture of origin has a systematic effect on the types of trademark the firm is more likely to prolong and on the length of the prolongation. The age of the trademark, the number of categories where a particular trademark is present, and the age of the firm increase the likelihood of a trademark's prolongation. Larger and more innovative firms tend to terminate their trademarks earlier. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Background: As alcohol-related health problems continue to rise, the attention of policy-makers is increasingly turning to Screening and Brief Intervention (SBI) programmes. The effectiveness of such programmes in primary healthcare is well evidenced, but very few cost-effectiveness analyses have been conducted and none which specifically consider the Italian context.</p>
<p>Methods: The Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model has been used to model the cost-effectiveness of government pricing and public health policies in several countries including England. This study adapts the model using Italian data to evaluate a programme of screening and brief interventions in Italy. Results are reported as Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) of SBI programmes versus a 'do-nothing' scenario.</p>
<p>Results: Model results show such programmes to be highly cost-effective, with estimated ICERs of (sic)550/Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained for a programme of SBI at next GP registration and (sic)590/QALY for SBI at next GP consultation. A range of sensitivity analyses suggest these results are robust under all but the most pessimistic assumptions.</p>

Most studies on economic development are informed by macroeconomic and entrepreneurial theories, the normative implications of which are unclear for public authorities attempting to enhance competitiveness and entrepreneurship in their communities. This paper discusses the centrality of implementation efforts for the effectiveness of regional and local competitiveness programmes and policies. Striving to capture the challenges posed by the international literature, the paper presents a managerial approach, developed under an inductive-deductive method grounded in some Italian cases of entrepreneurial development.

<p>The majority of the European countries have experienced a turn towards activation policies during the last two decades (Serrano Pascual and Magnusson 2007; van Berkel and Borghi 2008; Bonoli 2010; Aurich 2011; Graziano 2009 and 2012). The interlinked aim to increase employment rates by integrating formerly excluded groups into the labour market requires new forms of governance and new structures of policy implementation. One of these policy changes concerns the marketization of employment and social services (Considine 2001; Newman 2001), an important part of policy delivery in most welfare states although in very different forms and extents. Since the local level plays a crucial role in delivering policies (Kunzel 2012; Green and Orton 2012), an important element, and the main focus of the article, is the level of discretion of local actors and their relation to activation interventions.</p>
<p>This article draws on the findings of three qualitative case studies on the organization of activation policies in three most different countries regarding worlds of welfare: Germany, Italy and the UK. It develops a theoretical framework of regulating marketization in regard to activation, and analyses the three empirical cases according to it. The findings show a link between the regulation of market-based interventions (i.e. type of marketization, outsourcing decisions and purchaser-provider split) and the level of discretion for local actors with regard to these measures. Local contexts of policy-making and their suitability and willingness to become marketized will affect the usage of local discretion.</p>"

At multivariate analysis, young age at transplantation (RR: 0.97), shorter duration of dialysis (RR: 1.05 per each dialysis year), and graft from living donors (RR: 1.668) were independent predictors of recurrence.

<p>Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is an energy source with worldwide steady growth: natural gas supply, as gas demand, is expected to grow in the near future. LNG is stored in tanks at pressure slightly higher than the atmospheric value and at its boiling point. Despite the high degree of insulation in the tank walls, it is impossible to avoid a net input heat transfer from the surroundings, so that vaporization is always present. It causes an increase in the pressure of the tank and a consequent boiloff in order to avoid overpressure. The change in composition and density of the liquid phase is called LNG aging or weathering. This phenomenon has been studied in order to obtain a model that can predict the variations that occur in the tank over time. Unlike other previously developed models, the proposed model does not require knowledge of the boiloff rate; instead, it calculates the rate directly from the heat flow to the tank. As a consequence, from a comparison with experimental data, it is proved that a more reliable representation of the phenomenon can be obtained.</p>"

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>In recent years a growing body of literature has begun to consider the possible presence of path dependence in the development processes of countries. This phenomenon has always been recognized in regional and urban studies because the path of development almost naturally follows a history-dependent spatial diffusion influenced by both physical geography and the quality of institutions. In this paper, I consider the case of firm and employment concentration in Italy and its impact on local development. A large and growing literature has argued in favour of persisting effects of past institutions on current outcomes. Hence, in order to identify the impact of firm and employment density on income, I use instruments from the history of a set of Italian cities: namely the presence of a university and status as a free-city state in the Early Middle Ages. I first show that those two variables had an important effect on the process of urban development between 1300 and 1861, together with favourable geographic conditions. Then, when I use these instruments to predict firm and employment density, I find that the elasticity of income to firm and employment density is in the interval 0.08-0.13. This result is interpreted as providing evidence of the historical roots of agglomeration economies in Italy.</p>"

<p>Although the literature provides ample evidence that the global transfer and local implementation of knowledge represents a key advantage for multinational corporations (MNCs), we lack comparable understanding as to whether knowledge-creating MNC parents can actively expand the absorptive capacity of their subsidiaries. Using a teacher-student lens, this study examines the combined impact of specific structural mechanisms and motivational processes by MNC parents on the ability of 216 subsidiaries to absorb parent-initiated marketing strategies. The findings reveal that MNC parents can indeed cultivate subsidiaries' ability to appropriate marketing knowledge through a combination of adopting specific social structures and investing in particular efforts. However, the effect of social structure on subsidiary absorptive capacity is indirect, and accounted for by the parents' intensity of effort. A number of theoretical implications emerge from the findings for research on absorptive capacity in relation to the role of the knowledge source, the need to examine organizational influences in relation to one another, and validating the original absorptive capacity dimensions. For managers in the global marketplace, the findings lead to the suggestion that MNCs devote attention to nurturing the absorptive capacities at different organizational levels in order to optimize the global transfer of knowledge.</p>"

<p>We study which policy tool and at what level a majority chooses in order to reduce activities with negative externalities. We consider three instruments: a rule, that sets an upper limit to the activity which produces the negative externality, a quota that forces a proportional reduction of the activity, and a proportional tax on it. For all instruments the majority chooses levels which are too restrictive when the activity is performed mainly by a small fraction of the population, and when costs for reducing activities or paying taxes are sufficiently convex. Also a majority may prefer an instrument different than what a social planner would choose; for instance a rule when the social planner would choose a tax. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

<p>Extended producer responsibility is advocated for its capacity to spur resource efficiency through green innovation and closing loops downstream of consumption. Its rationale is the extension of the polluter-pays principle to the post-consumption phase. This paper analyze the underlying mechanisms that are supposed to work under the EPR approach, and proposes an alternative view. The main purpose of EPR is seen as the creation of the bases for legitimizing the involvement if industry taking over the task of diverting waste from landfill. Its success rests on the superior managerial capacity of industry and the need to organize post-consumption markets that transcend the local scale and have access to the economies of scale and scope. The emphasis on producers does not add anything special, but may reinforce the bases for legitimizing the implicit delegation of power to industry. Primary and above all, we have witnessed in the last 20 years a gigantic effort of market design, and this is the main demonstration of EPR's success. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

<p>Excise duties on roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco, which are generally based on RYO cigarettes containing 1 g of tobacco, are lower than duties on factory-made (FM) cigarettes. This provides a price incentive for smokers to switch to RYO, the use of which is increasing across Europe. To effectively approximate duties on the two types of products, accurate data on the weight of RYO cigarettes are required. We provide updated information on RYO use and RYO cigarette weight across Europe. From a representative face-to-face survey conducted in 2010 in 18 European countries (Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, England, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden), we considered data from 5158 current smokers aged 15 years or above, with available information on daily consumption of FM and RYO cigarettes separately. In Europe, 10.4% of current smokers (12.9% of men and 7.5% of women) were 'predominant' RYO users (i.e. > 50% of cigarettes smoked). This proportion was highest in England (27.3%), France (16.5%) and Finland (13.6%). The median weight of one RYO cigarette is 0.75 g (based on 192 smokers consuming exclusively RYO cigarettes). The proportion of RYO smokers is substantial in several European countries. Our finding on the weight of RYO cigarettes is consistent with the scientific literature and industry documents showing that the weight of RYO cigarettes is substantially lower than that of FM ones. Basing excise duties on RYO on an average cigarette weight of 0.75 g rather than 1 g would help increase the excise levels to those on FM cigarettes.</p>"

Density forecasts are constructed using Conditional Autoregressive Expectile models estimated with Asymmetric Least Squares. Forecast evaluation relies on quantile-weighed scoring rules, which identify regions of the distribution of interest to the analyst. Results show that both the centre and the left tail of the ethanol returns distribution can be predicted by using field crops returns. On the contrary, there is no evidence that ethanol can be used to forecast any region of the field crops or cattle returns distributions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Using five alternative data sets and a range of specifications concerning the underlying linear predictability models, we study whether long-run dynamic optimizing portfolio strategies may actually outperform simpler benchmarks in out-of-sample tests. The dynamic portfolio problems are solved using a combination of dynamic programming and Monte Carlo methods. The benchmarks are represented by two typical fixed mix strategies: the celebrated equally-weighted portfolio and a myopic, Markowitz-style strategy that fails to account for any predictability in asset returns. Within a framework in which the investor maximizes expected HARA (constant relative risk aversion) utility in a frictionless market, our key finding is that there are enormous difference in optimal long-horizon (in-sample) weights between the mean-variance benchmark and the optimal dynamic weights. In out-of-sample comparisons, there is however no clear-cut, systematic, evidence that long-horizon dynamic strategies outperform naively diversified portfolios. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

By considering the case of Milan, where a charge to enter the city centre was introduced in 2008, and by relying on an unexpected and temporary suspension of the tax, we analyse the effect of the policy on flows of vehicles classified by type of engine. We have found that a road pricing scheme shifted users from Euro 0-3 vehicles (i.e., those vehicles particularly polluting according to the European Emission Standards classification and produced before 2000-2001) to liquefied petroleum gas, bi-fuel and hybrid vehicles. However, the environmental benefits of the policy were limited by a substantial increase in the usage of motorbikes. This evidence calls for a consideration of the behavioural reactions of road users when making ex ante evaluations of the social profitability of road pricing schemes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The subsidy regime was ineffective and wasteful. Specific institutional and political features characterizing the Italian system are important components in this story.

Operations, in service companies, are often dispersed throughout the organisation and so it is difficult to understand where OM tools and practices can be applied and who should be in charge of their implementation.

<p>Using exploratory qualitative research undertaken in a multi-brand fashion company, this article investigates the role that brand units' images play in the link between human resources management (HRM) practices and employee internal and external turnover. Our results suggest that the existence of imbalanced and differently attractive brand units' images might weaken or remove the effectiveness of corporate HRM practices in keeping internal and external turnover rates low. This because employees may be interested in transferring to the most appealing brand(s) or, if not possible to do so, leaving the company. This article contributes to the debate regarding the use of HRM practices in multi-brand companies, especially in industries where both the brand and the product have a highly-symbolic content. Based on our conclusions, we recommend that brand units with less prestigious images compensate for their lower attractiveness with specific brand unit HRM practices to attract and retain their employees.

We argue that the international growth of firms stems from their interaction with governments, which act not only as rule setters but also as goal-oriented strategists, through public policies and mechanisms ranging from firm ownership to more indirect intervention designed to promote internationalization. We claim that the outcome of the interaction significantly depends on the country's form of capitalism. The particular form of capitalism manifested in a country is deeply rooted in historical and cultural behavioural models and differs according to path-dependent institutional changes. Our conjectures are empirically supported by a comparative analysis of the international growth of previously inward-looking domestic incumbents in the European energy and telecommunications industries over the last 15years.</p>"

The literature is reviewed to identify key co-production concepts, their interrelationships, and the underlying assumptions. A longitudinal case study is analyzed to expand the existing theoretical propositions. Policy implications for scaling-up programmes are drawn.</p>"

<p>Boards of directors are key governance mechanisms in organizations and fulfill two main tasks: monitoring managers and firm performance, and providing advice and access to resources. In spite of a wealth of research much remains unknown about how boards attend to the two tasks. This study investigates whether organizational (firm profitability) and environmental factors (industry regulation) affect board task performance. The data combine CEOs' responses to a questionnaire, and archival data from a sample of large Italian firms. Findings show that past firm performance is negatively associated with board monitoring and advice tasks; greater industry regulation enhances perceived board task performance; board monitoring and advice tasks tend to reinforce each other, despite their theoretical and practical distinction.

<p>Through a comparative study of six Italian hospitals, the paper develops and tests a framework to analyze hospital-wide patient flow performance.</p>
<p>The framework adopts a system-wide approach to patient flow management and is structured around three different levels: (1) the hospital, (2) the pipelines (possible patient journeys within the hospital) and (3) the production units (physical spaces, such as operating rooms, where service delivery takes places).</p>
<p>The focus groups and the data analysis conducted within the study support that the model is a useful tool to investigate hospital-wide implications of patient flows.</p>
<p>The paper provides also evidence about the causes of hospital patient flow problems. Particularly, while shortage of capacity does not seem to be a relevant driver, our data shows that patient flow variability caused by inadequate allocation of capacity does represent a key problem.

<p>This work is the first attempt to quantify the overall effects of a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) vaccination programme in the Dutch population taking into account all the direct and indirect effects of the vaccine on invasive pneumococcal disease. Using available Dutch data, a dynamic transmission model for the spread of pneumococci and potential subsequent invasive pneumococcal disease has been adapted to the Dutch setting. Overall, invasive pneumococcal disease cases in the Netherlands are predicted to decrease from a pre-vaccination level of 2623 cases annually to 2475, 2289, 2185, 2179, and 2178 cases annually 5-, 10-, 20-, 30-, and 40- years, respectively, post-vaccination. Therefore, vaccination with PCV13 in the Netherlands is predicted to lower invasive pneumococcal disease cases per year by up to 445 cases in the medium- to long-term. The results are quite robust for the sensitivity analyses performed on the parameters that regulate herd immunity and competition between vaccine and non-vaccine types.</p>"

<p>Purpose - The social responsibility of a tourism destination results from the combined efforts of the single stakeholders. This needs coordination and harmonization that cannot be achieved without a deep understanding of the structural and dynamic characteristics of the destination. A tourism destination is a complex dynamic system and requires specific methods to be analyzed and understood in order to better tailor governance actions for steering it along an evolutionary growth path, respectful of the social responsibility towards the community. Many methodological recommendations exist that allow to assess these features, and some have been successfully applied to tourism destinations. This paper aims to explore a new proposal: the visibility graph algorithm (VGA), which is able to provide the required level of information in a fast and simple way.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - VGA is a technique to map a time series into a network. The method and its implementation are relatively simple and straightforward. The mapping allows examining the system's properties by using network analytic methods. An example is worked out using data from two destinations: Italy as a country and the island of Elba, one of its most popular areas.</p>
<p>Findings - The complexity properties of the two destinations are examined and found in agreement with those obtained by using more complicated approaches, thus strengthening the reliability of the method.</p>
<p>Originality/value - This paper provides a new method to examine a tourism destination using a readily available set of data and a simple algorithm. The contribution of this work is mainly methodological. The technique provides insights into the complex structure and dynamics of a tourism destination. This has important implications for those interested in enriching the toolsets used to study a destination from a complex system perspective.</p>"

<p>Family firms represent a globally dominant form of organization, yet they confront a steep challenge of finding and managing competent leaders. Sometimes, these leaders cannot be found within the owning family. To date we know little about the governance contexts under which non-family leaders thrive or founder. Guided by concepts from agency theory and behavioural agency theory, we examine the conditions of ownership and leadership that promote superior performance among non-family CEOs of family firms. Our analysis of 893 Italian family firms demonstrates that these leaders outperform when they are monitored by multiple major family owners as opposed to a single owner; they also outperform when they are not required to share power with co-CEOs who are family members, and who may be motivated by parochial family socioemotional priorities.</p>"

<p>When modelling multivariate binomial data, it often occurs that it is necessary to take into consideration both clustering and overdispersion, the former arising from the dependence between data, and the latter due to the additional variability in the data not prescribed by the distribution. If interest lies in accommodating both phenomena at the same time, we can use separate sets of random effects that capture the within-cluster association and the extra variability. In particular, the random effects for overdispersion can be included in the model either additively or multiplicatively. For this purpose, we propose a series of Bayesian hierarchical models that deal simultaneously with both phenomena. The proposed models are applied to bivariate repeated prevalence data for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in injecting drug users in Italy from 1998 to 2007.</p>"

<p>Background: Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a hereditary genetic disease causing bilateral retinal degeneration. RP is a leading cause of blindness resulting in incurable visual impairment and drastic reduction in the Quality of life of the patients. Second Sight Medical Products Inc. developed Argus II, a retinal prosthesis system for treating RP. Argus II is the world's first ever-commercial implant intended to restore some vision in the blind patients. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of the Argus (R) II Retinal Prosthesis System (Argus II) in Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) patients.</p>
<p>Method: A multi -state transition Markov model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of Argus II versus usual care in RP from the perspective of healthcare payer. A hypothetical cohort of 1000 RP patients aged 46 years followed up over a (lifetime) 25-year time horizon. Health outcomes were expressed as quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct healthcare costs expressed in 2012 (sic). Results are reported as incremental cost per ratios (ICERs) with outcomes and costs discounted at an annual rate of 3.5%.</p>
<p>Results: The ICER for Argus II was (sic)14,603/QALY. Taking into account the uncertainty in model inputs the ICER was (sic)14,482/QALY in the probabilistic analysis. In the scenarios of an assumption of no reduction on cost across model visual acuity states or a model time horizon as short as 10 years the ICER increased to (sic) 31,890/QALY and (sic)49,769/QALY respectively.</p>
<p>Conclusion: This economic evaluation shows that Argus II is a cost-effective intervention compared to usual care of the RP patients. The lifetime analysis ICER for Argus II falls below the published societal willingness to pay of EuroZone countries.</p>"

<p>The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it presents the results of a ""history-friendly"" simulation model of evolution of the pharmaceutical industry. Second, it aims at contributing to a more general methodological discussion about agent-based models by proposing an econometric analysis of the results of the simulations. The case of the pharmaceutical industry has been studied extensively by scholars because, despite the high level of R&D intensity, the industry has been characterized by a relatively low levels of concentration. The model is able to reproduce the main stylized facts of the industry in an evolutionary perspective. In this paper we extend the analysis conducted in two previous works (Garavaglia et al. 2012, 2013) by further qualifying the findings with an extensive econometric investigation of the model outputs. The paper focuses the attention on the determinants of market structure, the innovative performance of the industry, the diversification in multiple submarkets and the level of prices. We find that the properties of the technological and demand regimes are key determinants of the patterns of industry evolution and that the main mechanisms driving the model are the random processes of search, the discovery of new submarkets as well as the interactions between patent protection, imitation and price competition. In addition, this paper emphasizes how the emerging leaders in the industry are those innovative early entrants which entered in large submarkets, showing the importance of the first mover advantage and of the size of the ""prize"" accruing to innovators when they discover a new rich submarket.</p>"

<p>Following Arthur Andersen's conviction for obstructing justice, auditors faced a one-time significant change in their regulatory environment because it was clear that (i) major audit partnerships could be closed and (ii) post Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), regulators would take a far more attentive (aggressive) role. In response auditors considered whether the pricing of audits should be revised to take account of the increased risk of regulatory intervention and litigation. Obviously such re-pricing would need to be targeted at those firms for which the risks were greatest. One early warning signal of such events occurring is the issuance by the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) of a Comment Letter (CL). We investigate whether there is any evidence that if a client receives a CL this is used to re-price audit services. Specifically, we investigate whether issuance resulted in upward pressure on audit fees, and whether this effect was simply transient around the issuance period or alternatively persisted some years into the future. This research finds that after a client receives a CL, auditors adjust audit fees upwards in the period in which the CL is received. In addition it is shown that for subsequent periods in which the auditor does not spend time assisting the client respond to a specific CL, an initial rise in audit fee persists. This is consistent with the hypothesis that auditors reassess the reputation and litigation risk of the client on the basis of the SEC issuance of a Comment Letter.</p>"

As in many parts of the West, one can observe a trend towards the deterioration of real wages in Spanish America at the end of the period. Our findings suggest that the 'Great Divergence' in living standards between Spanish America and the developed Western countries might have taken place mainly after independence and that currently available GDP per capita estimates might be too low.</p>"

<p>This paper reviews Italian Development Assistance for Health and overall contribution to Global Health from 2001 to 2012. It analyses strategies and roles of central and decentralized authorities as well as those of private non-profit and corporate actors. The research illustrates a very low and unstable official contribution that lags far behind internationally agreed upon objectives, a highly fragmented institutional scenario, and controversial political choices favouring ""vertical"" global initiatives undermining national health systems, and in contrast with Italian deep-rooted principles, traditional approaches and official guidelines.</p>
<p>Italy's contribution to global health goes beyond official development aid, however. The raising movement toward Universal Health Coverage may offer an extraordinary opportunity for a leading role to a country whose National Health System is founded on the principles of universal and equitable access to care. At the same time, the distinctive experience of Italian decentralized cooperation, with the involvement of a multiplicity actors in a coordinated effort for cooperation in health with homologous partners in developing countries, may offer - if adequately harnessed - new opportunities for an Italian ""system"" of development cooperation. Nevertheless, the indispensable prerequisite of a substantial increase in public funding is challenged by the current economic crisis and domestic political situation. For a renewed Italian role in development and global health, a paradigm shift is needed, requiring both conceptual revision and deep institutional and managerial reforms to ensure an appropriate strategic direction and an efficient and effective use of resources.</p>"

<p>Background: In a previous study we described the translation, cultural adaptation, and validation of the Italian version of the PTPSQ [PTPSQ-I(15)] in outpatients. To the authors' knowledge, the PTPSQ was never studied in a hospital setting.</p>
<p>The aims of this study were: (1) to establish the psychometric properties of the Physical Therapy Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire [PTPSQ-I(15)] in a sample of Italian inpatients, and (2) to investigate the relationships between the characteristics of patients and physical therapists and the indicators of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Methods: The PTPSQ-I(15) was administered to inpatients in a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Unit. Reliability of the PTPSQ-I(15) was measured by internal consistency (Cronbach's a) and test-retest stability (ICC 3,1). The internal structure was investigated by factor analysis. Divergent validity was measured by comparing the PTPSQ-I (15) with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain and with a 5-point Likert-type scale evaluating the Global Perceived Effect (GPE) of the physical therapy treatment.</p>
<p>Results: The PTPSQ-I(15) was administered to 148 inpatients, and 73 completed a second administration. The PTPSQ-I(15) showed high internal consistency (a = 0.949) and test-retest stability (ICC = 0.996). Divergent validity was moderate for the GPE (r = - 0.502, P < 0.001) and strong for the VAS (r = -0.17, P = 0.07). Factor analysis showed a one-factor structure.</p>
<p>Conclusions: The administration of PTPSQ-I(15) to inpatients demonstrated strong psychometric properties and its use can be recommended with Italian-speaking population. Further studies are suggested on the concurrent validity and on the psychometric properties of the PTPSQ-I(15) in different hospital settings or with other pathological conditions.</p>"

<p>We study the effects of the tax burden on tax evasion both theoretically and experimentally. We develop a theoretical framework of tax evasion decisions that is based on two behavioral assumptions: (1) taxpayers are endowed with reference dependent preferences that are subject to hedonic adaptation and (2) in making their choices, taxpayers are affected by ethical concerns. The model generates new predictions on how a change in the tax rate affects the decision to evade taxes. Contrary to the classical expected utility theory, but in line with previous applications of reference dependent preferences to taxpayers' decisions, an increase in the tax rate increases tax evasion. Moreover, as taxpayers adapt to the new legal tax rate, the decision to evade taxes becomes independent of the tax rate. We present results from a laboratory experiment that support the main predictions of the model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

An appealing aspect of this approach is that computations are relatively easy. In this paper, we examine the predictive performance of these models with an increasing number of covariates. Even for a moderate number of covariates, we find that the likelihood for x tends to dominate the posterior of the latent random partition, degrading the predictive performance of the model. To overcome this, we suggest using a different nonparametric prior, namely an enriched Dirichlet process. Our proposal maintains a simple allocation rule, so that computations remain relatively simple. Advantages are shown through both predictive equations and examples, including an application to diagnosis Alzheimer's disease.</p>"

Our results reaffirm the significance of gender ideology, though with important differences across countries. Time availability and relative resources matter in the most egalitarian countries, whereas economic dependency matters in countries where partners contribute more unevenly to the household income.</p>"

<p>This paper examines the competence development of subsidiaries in multinational enterprises. We analyze how local subsidiary environments affect the development of technological and business competencies among other units in the multinational enterprise. We test our predictions using data from 2,107 foreign-owned subsidiaries located in seven European countries, by means of structural equation modeling - namely, LISREL. By bringing the local environment to the fore, we contribute to the literature on the emergence and determinants of firm-specific advantages. We link local subsidiary environments to the development of the competencies of other units in the multinational enterprise. The role of the multinational enterprise is characterized as integrative, as it may bridge local competencies and environments that are conducive to competence creation, and as it facilitates the use of resources residing locally throughout the organization. Thus, we contribute to an enhanced understanding of location as a determinant of the creation of units of competence and centers of excellence within multinational enterprises. In other words, we demonstrate that country-specific advantages are beneficial for competence creation in units other than the local subsidiary. We thereby link country-specific advantages to the creation of firm-specific advantages in the multinational enterprise - i.e., the multinational enterprise can build and augment firm-specific advantages by making the most of country-specific advantages.

The optimal control problem is embedded in a suitable Hilbert space, and the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is considered in this space. It is proved that the value function is continuous with respect to a weak norm and that it solves in the viscosity sense the associated HJB equation. The main results are the proof of a directional C-1-regularity for the value function and the feedback characterization of optimal controls.</p>"

<p>The article aims at analysing the reasons why Italy failed to reform Long Term Care (LTC) policies, focusing on an aspect which has been overlooked: the interplay between LTC policies and the intergovernmental multilevel relationships. In the Italian LTC system, the main central intervention has been the regularisation of migrant care work, while the automatic growth of the cash benefits has accompanied the care needs evolution. Therefore the only institutional change has been a ""gradual transformation"". The causes of the failure to reform LTC have been mainly related to a strong fragmentation of the policy field, the existence of a universalistic cash benefit, the fiscal constraint. We argue that a further obstacle to reform LTC policies has been the weak and uncertain legislative framework of federalism. The uncertainty on the allocation and distribution of resources and the delay to apply the equalisation mechanism based on needs engendered a lame federalism that contributed to hindering welfare innovations and to increasing the institutional fragmentation.</p>
<p>The analysis is partly consistent with previous literature, although it places less emphasis on the role of the constituencies and the scarcity of resources in influencing decisions, focusing more on the implications of the failure to fully realise the federalist reform. This focus shows that to implement institutional change in the welfare system, it is important to take into account the features of the federal governance, the intergovernmental relations, and to address the challenges that are connected to them.

<p>Service innovation is a primary source of competitive advantage and a research priority. However, empirical evidence about the impact of innovativeness on new service adoption is inconclusive. A plausible explanation is that service innovation has thus far been studied using new product frameworks that do not fully capture the complexity of new service assessments by customers. We propose a different, holistic framework, which posits that new service adoption does not depend on individual service attributes, but on specific configurations of such attributes. We investigate this framework in a luxury hotel service context, using qualitative comparative analysis, a set-membership technique that is new to service research and suitable for configuration analyses. Results confirm that individual service attributes have complex trade-off effects and that only specific combinations of attributes act as sufficient conditions for new service adoption. Moreover, the composition of such combinations differs according to the different coproduction requirements. Our findings contribute to managerial practice by providing new insights for improving the service-development process and the launch strategy for new services. They also augment extant service knowledge by demonstrating why interdependencies among various innovation attributes are important to consider for gaining an accurate understanding of new service adoption.</p>"

<p>The control and eventual elimination of neglected tropical disease (NTD) requires the expansion of interventions such as mass drug administration (MDA), vector control, diagnostic testing, and effective treatment. The purpose of this paper is to present the evidence base for decision-makers on the cost and cost-effectiveness of lymphatic filariasis (LF) and onchocerciasis prevention, treatment, and control. A systematic review of the published literature was conducted. All studies that contained primary or secondary data on costs or cost-effectiveness of prevention and control were considered. A total of 52 papers were included for LF and 24 papers were included for onchocerciasis. Large research gaps exist on the synergies and cost of integrating NTD prevention and control programs, as well as research on the role of health information systems, human resource systems, service delivery, and essential medicines and technology for elimination. The literature available on costs and cost-effectiveness of interventions is also generally older, extremely focal geographically and of limited usefulness for developing estimates of the global economic burden of these diseases and prioritizing among various intervention options. Up to date information on the costs and cost-effectiveness of interventions for LF and onchocerciasis prevention are needed given the vastly expanded funding base for the control and elimination of these diseases.

<p>A recent literature has shown that REIT returns contain strong evidence of bull and bear dynamic regimes that may be best captured using nonlinear econometric models of the Markov switching type. In fact, REIT returns would display regime shifts that are more abrupt and persistent than in the case of other asset classes. In this paper we ask whether and how simple linear predictability models of the vector autoregressive (VAR) type may be extended to capture the bull and bear patterns typical of many asset classes, including REITs. We find that nonlinearities are so deep that it is impossibile for a large family of VAR models to either produce similar portfolio weights or to yield realized, ex-post out-of-sample long-horizon portfolio performances that may compete with those typical of bull and bear models. A typical investor with intermediate risk aversion and a 5-year horizon ought to be ready to pay an annual fee of up to 5.7 % to have access to forecasts of REIT returns that take their bull and bear dynamics into account instead of simpler, linear forecast.</p>"

<p>Complex planning procedures often amplify the difference in investment time between generation and transmission. In this work we consider a transmission project in Italy and, relying on a recently proposed methodology, we compare costs and benefits of anticipating the planning process before the connection of new power plants becomes certain. Whereas the system faces lower congestion costs if the network is reinforced immediately, anticipation constitutes a sunk cost in case generation is not built. For realistic load and generation scenarios, anticipation costs, as well as differences in investment times, our results indicate that anticipation is the most efficient choice for a relatively low connection probability. Analyses of this sort are particularly relevant in light of the increasing complexity of public engagement processes and of the remarkable growth in renewable generation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>In an open innovation relationship, the party that owns a key asset enjoys bargaining power that discourages the investments of the other party in the collaboration. We show that these incentives can be restored by conferring on the weak party the power to take decisions during the research process - e.g., a pharmaceutical firm with manufacturing and commercialization assets offers the direction of a joint research project to a biotech partner. However, on many occasions, the strong party still captures more value from the collaboration by retaining the power to take decisions during research even if it produces less innovation value and fewer aggregate profits. We conclude that the potential of open innovation is underexploited. In particular, owners may not release enough power to take decisions on the use of their assets. (C) 2013 Elsevier BM.

<p>Background: Palm oil (PO) may be an unhealthy fat because of its high saturated fatty acid content.</p>
<p>Objective: The objective was to assess the effect of substituting PO for other primary dietary fats on blood lipid related markers of coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p>
<p>Design: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of dietary intervention trials. Studies were eligible if they included original data comparing PO-rich diets with other fat-rich diets and analyzed at least one of the following CHD/CVD biomarkers: total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, TC/HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol, triacylglycerols, apolipoprotein A-I and B, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lipoprotein(a).</p>
<p>Results: Fifty-one studies were included. Intervention times ranged from 2 to 16 wk, and different fat substitutions ranged from 4% to 43%. Comparison of PO diets with diets rich in stearic acid, mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) showed significantly higher TC, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein A-I, whereas most of the same biomarkers were significantly lower when compared with diets rich in myristic/lauric acid. Comparison of PO-rich diets with diets rich in trans fatty acids showed significantly higher concentrations of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I and significantly lower apolipoprotein B, triacylglycerols, and TC/HDL cholesterol. Stratified and meta-regression analyses showed that the higher concentrations of TC and LDL cholesterol, when PO was substituted for MUFAs and PUFAs, were not significant in young people and in subjects with diets with a lower percentage of energy from fat.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Both favorable and unfavorable changes in CHD/ CVD risk markers occurred when PO was substituted for the primary dietary fats, whereas only favorable changes occurred when PO was substituted for trans fatty acids. Additional studies are needed to provide guidance for policymaldng.</p>"

<p>This paper examines the role of legal investor protection for the efficiency of the market for corporate control when bidders are financially constrained. In the model, stronger legal investor protection increases bidders' outside funding capacity. However, absent effective bidding competition, this does not improve efficiency, as the bid price, and thus bidders' need for funds, increases one-for-one with the pledgeable income. In contrast, under effective competition for the target, the increased outside funding capacity improves efficiency by making it less likely that more efficient but less wealthy bidders are outbid by less efficient but wealthier rivals.</p>"

The hypothesis that the price of works of art can be explained exclusively by a number of pre-established variables is rejected. A positive correlation is observed between estimated and final prices, but the latter is usually underestimated. Financial models are not always fully effective in assessing prices, since products are often represented by ""unique pieces"" and their markets work differently than the standard markets represented in the financial model. The research suggests that non-financial factors such as aesthetics can prevail over economic factors in forecasting the prices of artworks.</p>"

<p>Emotion influences most aspects of cognition and behavior, but emotional factors are conspicuously absent from current models of word recognition. The influence of emotion on word recognition has mostly been reported in prior studies on the automatic vigilance for negative stimuli, but the precise nature of this relationship is unclear. Various models of automatic vigilance have claimed that the effect of valence on response times is categorical, an inverted U, or interactive with arousal. In the present study, we used a sample of 12,658 words and included many lexical and semantic control factors to determine the precise nature of the effects of arousal and valence on word recognition. Converging empirical patterns observed in word-level and trial-level data from lexical decision and naming indicate that valence and arousal exert independent monotonic effects: Negative words are recognized more slowly than positive words, and arousing words are recognized more slowly than calming words. Valence explained about 2% of the variance in word recognition latencies, whereas the effect of arousal was smaller. Valence and arousal do not interact, but both interact with word frequency, such that valence and arousal exert larger effects among low-frequency words than among high-frequency words. These results necessitate a new model of affective word processing whereby the degree of negativity monotonically and independently predicts the speed of responding. This research also demonstrates that incorporating emotional factors, especially valence, improves the performance of models of word recognition.</p>"

<p>This study examines whether inventors' past stock of inventions affects the rate at which they produce technological breakthroughs, as well as the role of organizational contingencies in moderating this effect. The breakthrough rate depends on the rate at which an inventor generates inventions and the probability that each of these inventions is a breakthrough. We argue that inventors with larger patent records generate a higher rate of inventions, but the single inventions that they generate each have a lower probability of being a breakthrough. Longitudinal data of 5,144 European inventors and fixed-effects estimation confirm these predictions and reveal that the net effect of the inventors' stock of past inventions on the breakthrough rate is positive-that is, more established inventors display a higher rate of breakthroughs than brand-new inventors. We also confirm the role of organizational contexts in shaping inventors' productivity. In particular, firms' control over research and development targets lessens the advantage of established inventors with regard to the rate of breakthrough generation.</p>"

<p>Objective. To identify the main strengths, weaknesses, and challenges of the Ecuador-Peru ""peri-border"" health care program and to analyze the legislative, managerial, and organizational arrangements adopted to integrate the two country's national health systems in the border area.</p>
<p>Methods. A descriptive, qualitative case study was carried out using three complementary methods: literature review and analysis of official Peruvian and Ecuadoran national and binational documents, 18 semi-structured interviews of key informants, and a survey of the entire health worker population of the Suyo-Macara binational micro-network.</p>
<p>Results. The key program challenge was the absence of reciprocity; Peruvian citizens were entitled to free health care services in Ecuador but Ecuadoran citizens did not receive the same benefit in Peru. The need for improvements in the binational system's human resources was also identified. The program's main strength was its organizational structure, which is designed mainly for the implementation of 1) the binational network and 2) a patient referral / counter-referral system that includes the transfer of patient clinical information.</p>
<p>Conclusions. Notwithstanding considerable challenges, peri-border programs are feasible and replicable. Program success seems to be highly dependent on the completion of a number of steps, including 1) consolidation of the original binational memorandum into a binding binational agreement between the two countries; 2) achievement of similar standards in both countries for the provision and quality of health care services, focusing on complementarities; and 3) development of an integrated binational information system.</p>"

<p>Bayesian inference is attractive due to its internal coherence and for often having good frequentist properties. However, eliciting an honest prior may be difficult, and common practice is to take an empirical Bayes approach using an estimate of the prior hyperparameters. Although not rigorous, the underlying idea is that, for a sufficiently large sample size, empirical Bayes methods should lead to similar inferential answers as a proper Bayesian inference. However, precise mathematical results on this asymptotic agreement seem to be missing. In this paper, we give results in terms of merging Bayesian and empirical Bayes posterior distributions. We study two notions of merging: Bayesian weak merging and frequentist merging in total variation. We also show that, under regularity conditions, the empirical Bayes approach asymptotically gives an oracle selection of the prior hyperparameters. Examples include empirical Bayes density estimation with Dirichlet process mixtures.</p>"

<p>Assessing impacts related to the adoption of an innovation represents a particular challenge. However, the use of innovation in government organizations does have some effects: some intended, others unintended; some desirable, others undesirable. Findings in literature now suggest that the use of innovation in government organizations produces beneficial results for the most part. The purpose of this article is to provide a multidimensional framework for assessing the impacts of innovation on an organization's performance as perceived by individual stakeholders and at organizational level. In particular, this framework is designed to evaluate the impacts resulting from the introduction of electronic medical records, namely an organizational, cultural, and technological innovation that many health care providers are currently undertaking. It provides the results of a comparative analysis carried out in Spain and Italy and discusses the need for a more systematic evaluation assessment of the innovation processes.</p>"

<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is currently undergoing fundamental reform that is intended to impact its programmes and priority setting and its financial and governing structures. Within the reform debates, new relations of powers are emerging among traditional donors and emerging economies such as the 'BRICS': Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. These five emerging economies have formally committed 'to strengthen and legitimise the WHO as the coordinating authority in global health' through the principle of multilateralism. In this paper, the results of a qualitative study - based on 21 key informant interviews - that seeks to better understand BRICS' engagement in this organisation and the extent to which their action enables these countries to influence the reform process were presented. The results show that individual BRICS countries found natural pairings with each other on both particular elements of the reform, notably governance and WHO financing, and specific health issues. While numerous examples of individual BRICS countries seeking to raise the profile of specific health issues were found, some evidence of a coordinated effort to influence reform as a bloc was also found. Although this was largely limited to rhetorical announcements of support in formal Declarations and Communiques, it nevertheless articulates a vision of the WHO as an organisation with a broad mandate delivered with sufficient, predictable funding.</p>"

<p>This paper challenges the conventional wisdom that objective distance between team members (e.g., measured in miles) translates directly and fully into subjective distance (i.e., a team's perception of distance between its members). Drawing on social information processing theory, we argue that the level of subjective distance is likely to predict important team outcomes better than the level of objective distance. Using responses from 678 team leaders and team members pertaining to 161 new product development projects in the software industry, our results show that the subjective perception of distance is affected rather by team members' national diversity than their physical distance. We also find that subjective distance has a significant impact on team collaboration, while objective distance measures, however, have no impact on team collaboration.

<p>In this paper we investigate the role of expected returns to schooling and of perceived risks (of unemployment and earnings) as determinants of schooling decisions. Moreover, our data also allow us to analyze whether youths' and/or mothers' expectations predict schooling decisions, and whether this depends on the age and gender of the youth. In particular, we use Mexican data that contain labor market expectations of mothers and youths. We find that expected returns and risk perceptions are important determinants of schooling decisions, the latter in particular from the perspective of the mother. Boys' expectations predict the decision to enter college, but not to enter high school. While girls' own expectations do not predict either of the two educational decisions, mothers' expectations are particularly strong predictors of their daughters' decisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The bank-level analysis reinforces these results and shows that the latter factors are also key determinants across banks, thus explaining the probability of bank crisis.

It maps the co-evolution between KIBS and manufacturing in European regions, identifying emergent typologies of regional innovation systems. Results show that KIBS are a defining element of innovation-oriented regions, whereas their scarcity and slow growth distinctively characterize poor performing innovation systems. However, the analysis also identifies a set of core manufacturing regions in Europe, which are evolving along a different trajectory into knowledge-oriented service-manufacturing complexes.</p>"

<p>Objective: The goal of the present study is to assess the awarded prices and thus the real level of competition the regional tenders referring to biosimilars in Italy achieved. Methods: We conducted a web-based analysis to collect detailed information on regional biosimilar tenders, up to December 2012. We identified 191 lots referring to the three off-patent biologicals (somatropin, epoetin and filgrastim) mentioned in the 24 tenders that took place during the study period (2008-2012).</p>
<p>A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between prices awarded (dependent variable) and potentially explanatory variables (base quantities, bioagent, number of competitors, purchasing region and time). Results: While the price of somatropin stayed steady, those of filgrastim and epoetin dropped steeply. The mean number of competitors was lowest for somatropin and highest for filgrastim. One additional competitor was associated with about a 10% reduction in the price on average. The benefits of having many competitors did not fade with increasing numbers of companies.</p>
<p>Discussion: Our analysis confirms the theory that worthwhile savings can be generated in tenders, once the bid is designed in such a way that competition can produce its effects, i.e. allowing more than one manufacturer to tender. However, most of the Italian regional tenders on off-patent bioagents do not seem to exploit potential competition to the full. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

We show that, if lobbying is not costly, both sectors will lobby in equilibrium and the education policy will induce the same skill composition that would be chosen by the social planner. However, if lobbying is costly and there is sufficient asymmetry between the sectors, only one sector will exert pressure on the policy-maker in the attempt to direct resources toward the type of education required by its production. Which sector will engage in lobbying depends on relative size, productivity, and price.

<p>The recent availability of survey data on social contact patterns has made possible important advances in the understanding of the social determinants of the spread of close-contact infections, and of the importance of long-lasting contacts for effective transmission to occur. Still, little is known about the relationship between two of the most critical identified factors (frequency of contacts and duration of exposure) and how this relationship applies to different types of infections. By integrating data from two independently collected social surveys (Polymod and time use), we propose a model that combines these two transmission determinants into a new epidemiologically relevant measure of contacts: the number of ""suitable"" contacts, which is the number of contacts that involve a sufficiently long exposure time to allow for transmission. The validity of this new epidemiological measure is tested against Italian serological data for varicella and parvovirus-B19, with uncertainty evaluated using the Bayesian melding technique. The model performs quite well, indicating that the interplay between time of exposure and contacts is critical for varicella transmission, while for B19 it is the duration of exposure that matters for transmission.</p>"

<p>Hippocampal volume is one of the best established biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. However, for appropriate use in clinical trials research, the evolution of hippocampal volume needs to be well understood. Recent theoretical models propose a sigmoidal pattern for its evolution. To support this theory, the use of Bayesian nonparametric regression mixture models seems particularly suitable due to the flexibility that models of this type can achieve and the unsatisfactory predictive properties of semiparametric methods. In this article, our aim is to develop an interpretable Bayesian nonparametric regression model which allows inference with combinations of both continuous and discrete covariates, as required for a full analysis of the dataset. Simple arguments regarding the interpretation of Bayesian nonparametric regression mixtures lead naturally to regression weights based on normalized sums. Difficulty in working with the intractable normalizing constant is overcome thanks to recent advances in MCMC methods and the development of a novel auxiliary variable scheme. We apply the new model and MCMC method to study the dynamics of hippocampal volume, and our results provide statistical evidence in support of the theoretical hypothesis.</p>"

<p>This paper systematically examines conditions associated with continuation of e-learning initiatives in universities. Conditions associated with institutional, developer, instructor, student and technology issues were identified from a review of the literature. Authors of 64 empirical papers describing e-learning initiatives (20 of which had not continued) published in the peer-reviewed literature rated and explained the role of each condition in continuation of their initiative to the time of the study, which was at least three years after all the papers were published. Initiatives reported on at three different times in the development of e-learning between 2000 and 2008 were represented among continued and non-continued initiatives. Conditions associated with learning and student response were well met in both cases. On the other hand, neither continued nor non-continued initiatives were seen to offer much financial advantage to the university. The conditions that distinguished between continued and non-continued initiatives were dominated by characteristics of the technology and institutional support for the initiative, especially financial support. Technology needed to be up to date, but also sufficiently mature or stable, to support continuation. Continued initiatives were also more likely to have involved other people in development and diffusion following the initial implementation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Background. In Italy, the project on the social burden and quality of life (QoL) of patients with haemophilia investigates costs from a society perspective and provides an overview of their quality of life. Moreover, as life expectancy increased in recent years along with new treatment strategies implemented in the last decades, it analyses trends of costs other than drugs simulating impacts during patient whole life.</p>
<p>Material and methods. We ran a web-based cross-sectional survey supported by the Italian Federation of Haemophilia Societies in recruiting patients with haemophilia and their caregivers. We developed a questionnaire to collect information on demographic characteristics, healthcare and social services consumption, formal and informal care utilisation, productivity loss and quality of life. In particular, quality of life was assessed through the EuroQoL tool. Last, we applied the illness cost method from a society perspective.</p>
<p>Results. On average, quality of life is worse in adult patients compared to child and caregivers: more than 75% of adult patients declare physical problems, 43% of adult patients and 54% of their parents have anxiety problems. Assuming a society perspective, the estimated mean annual total cost per patient in 2012 is 117,732 e. Drugs represent 92% of total costs. Focusing on costs other than drugs, each additional point of EuroQoL tool implies a costs' reduction of 279. The impact of age varies across age groups: each added year implies a total decrease of costs up to 46.6 years old. Afterwards, every additional year increases costs.</p>
<p>Discussion. Quality of life of patients with haemophilia and their caregivers improved and it influences positively on consumed resources and on their contribution to the social-economic system. Costs other than drugs for patients with haemophilia follow the same trends of general population.</p>"

<p>The engineering processes are made up of a number of the phenomenons working together that may lead to defects with multiple causes. In order to model such types of multiple cause defect systems we may not rely on simple probability models and hence, the need arises for mixture models. The commonly used control charts are based on simple models with the assumption that the process is working under the single cause defect system. This study proposes a control chart for the two component mixture of inverse Rayleigh distribution. The proposed chart namely IRMQC chart is based on mixture cumulative quantity using the quantity of product inspected until specified numbers of defects are observed. The single cause chart is also discussed as a special case of the proposed mixture cumulative quantity chart. The control structure of the proposed chart is designed, and its performance is evaluated in terms of some useful measures, including average run length (ARL), expected quality loss (EQL) and relative ARL (RARL). An illustrative example along a case study, is also given to highlight the practical aspects of the proposal. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>M any scholars have argued that systems for treating waste impede organizations from preventing waste in the first place. They theorize that end-of-pipe (EOP) treatment diminishes the incentive to avoid creating waste in the production process and obscures the information necessary to devise prevention techniques. This prediction has been widely accepted, influencing both policy and practice, despite both a lack of supporting empirical evidence and the existence of a counterprediction. In this paper, we use data describing U.S. manufacturing establishments from 1991 to 2005 to test the connection between EOP treatment and waste reduction. Our findings show that EOP treatment is associated with an initial jump in reported waste, followed by ongoing reduction. We analyze these results by exploring mechanisms that may drive this relationship. For practitioners, our paper provides critical guidance about strategies for reducing waste. For scholars of environmental management, our paper provides new insight on when facilities accomplish ""source reduction"" of process waste. For broader management theories of operations and organizational design, our analysis provides new insight on boundary conditions for extrapolation from existing theories. Finally, our paper provides new guidance for the formulation of effective regulatory policy.</p>"

We find that extensive margin (Melitz-type selection) effects are robust to relaxing the CES assumption. Intensive margin effects (market share reallocations across inframarginal firms) and competitive (markup) effects are instead fragile. An important implication is that measured productivity gains from trade opening are no longer ensured with non-CES preferences. We discuss our results in the light of alternative setups featuring non-additive preferences, strategic interaction and consumers' preference for an ideal variety. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate the behaviors of single indicator models, forecast combinations and factor models, in a pseudo real-time framework. MIDAS with an AR component performs quite well, and outperforms MF-VAR at most horizons. Bridge equations perform well overall. Forecast pooling is superior to most of the single indicator models overall. Pooling information using factor models gives even better results. The best results are obtained for the components for which more economically related monthly indicators are available. Nowcasts of GDP components can then be combined to obtain nowcasts for the total GDP growth. (C) 2013 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>As a generalization of the factor-augmented VAR (FAVAR) and of the Error Correction Model (ECM), Banerjee and Marcellino (2009) introduced the Factor-augmented Error Correction Model (FECM). The FECM combines error-correction, cointegration and dynamic factor models, and has several conceptual advantages over the standard ECM and FAVAR models. In particular, it uses a larger dataset than the ECM and incorporates the long-run information which the FAVAR is missing because of its specification in differences. In this paper, we examine the forecasting performance of the FECM by means of an analytical example, Monte Carlo simulations and several empirical applications. We show that FECM generally offers a higher forecasting precision relative to the FAVAR, and marks a useful step forward for forecasting with large datasets.

<p>We perform a comprehensive examination of the recursive, comparative predictive performance of linear and nonlinear models for UK stock and bond returns. We estimate Markov switching, threshold autoregressive (TAR) and smooth transition autoregressive (STR) regime switching models and a range of linear specifications including models with GARCH type specifications. Results demonstrate UK asset returns require nonlinear dynamics to be modelled with strong evidence in favour of Markov switching frameworks. Our results appear robust to the choice of sample period, changes in loss functions and to the methodology employed to test for equal predictive accuracy. The key findings extend to a similar sample of US data.</p>"

<p>When firms tap external knowledge sources, they risk spillovers of their own internal knowledge. If the value of this potential loss and the imitation capabilities of neighboring organizations are high, fear of imitation might overshadow the benefits of openness. In such situations, firms might voluntarily reduce their use of external sources, relative to knowledge available internally. Data pertaining to 4,623 European inventions and direct information about the use of knowledge sources confirm that firms reduce their use of external, relative to internal, knowledge when they conduct costly research projects in locations characterized by high levels of absorptive capacity in a specific technology. This study also reveals fear of imitation as a mediating factor of this behavior. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>This study examines the impact of ambient scent on the perception and memory of art, in terms of perceived valence, arousal, and remembering of artworks. Because art perception evokes emotions and embodiment, the experiential marketing literature suggests using sensorial stimuli to enhance the experience of visiting art exhibitions. Although a fragrance in the environment can make visiting enjoyable, we examine more specifically the effects of scent on perception and memory of art, including potential interactions between different scents and artworks. In a between-participant experiment, this study shows some counterintuitive effects of scent on both evaluation and memory of art: a pleasant ambient scent can decrease evaluations of artworks and hinder memory of those artworks. Furthermore, scent and art have an interactive effect on arousal, such that incongruent scents and artworks increase arousal relative to congruent scents and artworks. In conclusion, enhancing experiences through sensorial cues can counterintuitively hinder the evaluation and memory of art. To the extent that art institutions aim to spread knowledge and appreciation of art, managers should be aware that ambient scents can actually interfere with this mission.

<p>Being typically hedonic, arts and culture by definition provide pleasurable experiences that are consumed for their own sake. If pleasure acts as the key emotion in these experiences, at the same time other emotions might be elicited by the rich and holistic environment and the interaction that takes place between the cultural product and the consumer. By adopting the common theoretical framework of the PAD model (Mehrabian & Russell, 1974), but innovating in the structural links among the three main affective dimensions-pleasure, arousal, and dominance (PAD)-this study empirically tests whether arousal, dominance, and their interaction generate pleasure. Findings show that arousal and dominance affect pleasure positively and significantly, whereas their interaction affects it negatively. Pleasure leads to a direct and positive effect on satisfaction that mediates a positive effect on behavioral intention. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"

<p>Consumer repurchase behavior is a major concern for performing arts organizations because of its impact on their financial sustainability and competitive strength. Consequently, prior research has devoted a huge effort to the investigation of customer loyalty to individual performing arts organizations within a conceptual framework of within-category competition. However, arts consumption research has highlighted that performing arts organizations also face fierce competition from other categories of artistic and entertainment products, since consumers believe that different product categories are able to provide similar hedonic and entertainment value. Our paper investigates the antecedents of repurchase behavior at the product category level. Specifically, we focus on the interplay between positive emotions and product involvement as predictors of repurchase behavior in the performing arts at the product category level. In this context, we modeled four different types of relationships among positive emotions, product involvement, and repurchase behavior. We then conducted a survey among theatergoers and used structural equation modeling to test the rival models. Our findings indicate that product involvement fully mediates the relation between positive emotions and repurchase behavior in the performing arts. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p>"

<p>We present an empirical model of wealth transfer taxation in the revenue systems of the G7 countries-Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US-over the period from 1965 to 2009. Our model emphasizes the influences of population aging and of the stock of household wealth in an explanation of the past and likely future of this tax source. Simulations with the model using U.N. demographic projections and projections of household wealth suggest that even in France and Germany where reliance on wealth transfer taxation has been increasing for part of the period studied, wealth transfer taxes can be expected to wither away as population aging deepens over the next two decades. Our results indicate that recent tax designs that rely upon the taxation of wealth transfers to preserve equity in the face of declining taxation of capital incomes may be, in this respect, politically infeasible for the foreseeable future. We conclude by using the case of wealth transfer taxation to raise the general question of the extent to which the consistency of a proposed reform with expected political equilibria ought to play a role in the design of a normative policy blueprint.</p>"

<p>Patient flows across the regions of the Italian National Health Service can shed light on patient mobility, including cross-border flows within the European Union. We used 2009 data on 11,531 NHS admissions for aortic valve replacement operations to measure the extent of inter-regional patient mobility and to determine whether resident and nonresident patients differ. We also investigated whether public and private hospitals behave differently in terms of attracting patients. For this major cardio-surgical intervention, patient mobility in Italy is substantial (13.6% of total admissions). Such mobility mainly involves patients moving from southern to northern regions, which often requires several hundred kilometers of travel and a transfer of financial resources from poorer to richer regions. Patients admitted in the regions where they reside are older than those admitted outside their regions (69.2 versus 65.6, p < 0.0001), and stay in hospital approximately 0.7 days longer (14.7 versus 14.0, p = 0.017). Compared to public hospitals, private hospitals are more likely to admit non-resident patients (OR between 2.1 and 4.4). The extent and direction of patients' mobility raise equity concerns, as receiving care in locations that are distant from home requires substantial financial and relational resources.

Based on a sample of sales managers in a major European Union country, we present new evidence that (a) formal and informal sales controls exert differential impact on salespeople's AS and COS behaviors; (b) AS directly and positively influences sales unit effectiveness; (c) COS affects sales unit effectiveness only indirectly, i.e. by fostering AS; and (d) outcome and cultural controls directly improve sales unit effectiveness.

<p>Multiprofessional primary care models promise to deliver better care and reduce waste. This study evaluates the impact of such a model, the primary care unit (PCU), on three outcomes. A multilevel analysis within a ""pre- and post-PCU"" study design and a cross-sectional analysis were conducted on 215 PCUs located in the Emilia-Romagna region in Italy. Seven dimensions captured a set of processes and services characterizing a well-functioning PCU, or its degree of vitality. The impact of each dimension on outcomes was evaluated. The analyses show that certain dimensions of PCU vitality (i.e., the possibility for general practitioners to meet and share patients) can lead to better outcomes. However, dimensions related to the interaction and the joint works of general practitioners with other professionals tend not to have a significant or positive impact. This suggests that more effort needs to be invested to realize all the potential benefits of the PCU's multiprofessional approach to care.</p>"

<p>The development of flexible parametric classes of probability models in Bayesian analysis is a very popular approach. This study is designed for heterogeneous population for a two-component mixture of the Laplace probability distribution. When a process initially starts, the researcher expects that the failure components will be very high but after some improvement/inspection it is assumed that the failure components will decrease sufficiently. That is why in such situation the Laplace model is more suitable as compared to the normal distribution due to its fatter tails behaviour. We considered the derivation of the posterior distribution for censored data assuming different conjugate informative priors. Various kinds of loss functions are used to derive these Bayes estimators and their posterior risks. A method of elicitation of hyperparameter is discussed based on a prior predictive approach. The results are also compared with the non-informative priors. To examine the performance of these estimators we have evaluated their properties for different sample sizes, censoring rates and proportions of the component of the mixture through the simulation study. To highlight the practical significance we have included an illustrative application example based on real-life mixture data.</p>"

<p>The practice of Revenue Management has received widespread acceptance in the international hospitality industry yet a lack of best practice in terms of organizational integration persists. This paper follows the notion that revenue management is first and foremost a human activity, dependent on knowledge exchange and concerted decision within revenue management teams. One critical attribute of effective teams is group cohesion. The authors contrasted communication networks of 38 revenue management teams by means of social network analysis to identify the antecedents and consequences of group cohesion. It was found that industry employment, age and revenue management experience define the structure of communication networks and that awareness of other's expertise is central in explaining differences team performance across the sample. The findings highlight the issue of knowledge asymmetry in teams and suggest that the Revenue Manager occupies a more active role as an information broker in order to enhance group decision making.

<p>In this paper we lay out a two-region dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of an open economy within the European Monetary Union. The model, which is built in the New Keynesian tradition, contains real and nominal rigidities such as habit formation in consumption, price and wage stickiness as well as rich stochastic structure. The framework also incorporates the theory of unemployment, small open economy aspects and a nominal interest rate that is set exogenously by the area-wide monetary authority. As an illustration, the model is estimated on Luxembourgish data. We evaluate the properties of the estimated model and assess its forecasting performance relative to reduced-form model such as vector autoregression (VAR).

We use a series of discrete-time event history models with random effects at the dyadic level. Results show that, net of confounding effects, a friend's childbearing increases an individual's risk of becoming a parent.

<p>About 60% of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) may be cured by primary chemotherapy with an R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) regimen. Most of the rest will die of the disease, mainly due to the occurrence of tumor drug resistance. Many efforts have been made to explain the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance in patients with cancer, including those with DLBCL. This exploratory study was designed to correlate the mRNA expression levels of candidate genes mainly involved in the doxorubicin pathway (ABCB1, GSTP1, TOPO2 alpha, BCL2, PKC beta II) with the outcome of 54 patients with DLBCL undergoing a dose-dense R-CHOP regimen. After multivariate analysis, high GSTP1 (p = 0.003) and TOPO2 alpha (p = 0.02) gene expressions were associated with shorter overall survival and progression-free survival, respectively, suggesting that these genes may represent an unfavorable prognostic factor in the case of R-CHOP treatment. These biomarkers may be useful for selecting patients eligible for personalized chemotherapy after validation in an independent set.</p>"

<p>This paper examines the use of Dirichlet process mixtures for curve fitting. An important modelling aspect in this setting is the choice between constant and covariate-dependent weights. By examining the problem of curve fitting from a predictive perspective, we show the advantages of using covariate-dependent weights. These advantages are a result of the incorporation of covariate proximity in the latent partition. However, closer examination of the partition yields further complications, which arise from the vast number of total partitions. To overcome this, we propose to modify the probability law of the random partition to strictly enforce the notion of covariate proximity, while still maintaining certain properties of the Dirichlet process. This allows the distribution of the partition to depend on the covariate in a simple manner and greatly reduces the total number of possible partitions, resulting in improved curve fitting and faster computations. Numerical illustrations are presented.</p>"

<p>This research shows in a series of studies that exposing consumers to functional products evokes the naive theory of popularity, whereas exposing them to self-expressive products induces belief in the naive theory of exclusivity. The research further demonstrates that when the naive theory elicited by product type is matched by the appropriate contextual purchasing cues regarding the interest of others, it results in greater purchase intentions than when those cues are mismatched. The research specifies that the matching effect for functional products is mediated by consumers' perceptions of product quality, whereas mediation for self-expressive products occurs through consumers' self-perceptions regarding the extent to which the product conveys uniqueness. Finally, the research illustrates that an explicit signal of product quality (e.g., a favorable rating in Consumer Reports) attenuates the effect associated with the contextual cues regarding the interest of others.

<p>This paper investigates the effects of financial constraints on the outcome of different types of creative tasks such as product ideation and product repair. Four experimental studies examine the effect of financial constraints on creativity of the outcome of a product ideation task, and compare the effect of financial constraints with the effect of another type of constraint (i.e., input restrictions) on creativity of products ideated and on the amount of resources invested in the development of the creative solution. Furthermore, these studies explore the type of creative process ignited by financial constraints and analyze the effect of financial constraints in interaction with an individual difference such as novelty seeking, which embraces more remote determinants of creative performance, on the creativity of the outcomes to a product ideation task, as well as on the creativity of the outcomes to a more constrained task such as repairing an existing product. The results suggest that constrained financial resources may be beneficial to creativity. Financial constraints lead to the ideation of more creative products. Yet these products are generated using fewer inputs and a lower budget than products generated in an unconstrained condition. Furthermore, while yielding outcomes as creative as the ones generated under input constraints, financial constraints induce a parsimonious mindset reflected in the use of less costly resources. More interestingly, financial constraints activate a top-down rather than a bottom-up processing strategy in approaching the creative task. Finally, the results show that the effect of financial constraints is stronger for individuals with inherent tendencies toward novelty seeking, because their stock of experiences and perspectives puts them under stress when facing an unconstrained problem space. This interaction effect holds not only for product ideation tasks, but also when the problem space is already constrained in nature, as in the case of repairing a product. These findings, which are quite counterintuitive from the perspective of classic new product development literature, suggest that, at least under certain conditions, the use of financial constraints might constitute a promising approach to foster new ideas' generation, one that leads to more creative outcomes despite using less costly inputs. In addition, our results suggest that, when dealing with a creative task, companies should modulate the adoption of this kind of constraint on the individual characteristics of their employees, specifically on their innate tendency to seek novelty.</p>"

<p>Although design and technological innovations are conceptually distinct and require significantly different resource investments by the firm, little is known about how differing strategies employed in relation to these new products influence changes in market share across national cultures. In this study, the authors provide insights into how technological and design product innovations and product portfolio breadth strategies influence changes in market share within 26 technological and 12 design innovations across 17 firms operating in eight European countries. The results indicate that the positive effect of design innovation on changes in market share strengthens as individualism and indulgence increase, whereas the positive relationship between technological innovations and market share is weakened as uncertainty avoidance and indulgence increase. In addition, the positive relationship between design product portfolio breadth strategies and changes in market share is strengthened as individualism and indulgence increase but is weakened as uncertainty avoidance increases, whereas the positive relationship between technological product portfolio breadth and changes in market share is strengthened as individualism increases.

<p>Design/methodology/approach - The paper reflexively examines the evolution of a research process through which a team of researchers and a company tried to understand how the online consumer experience unfolds. The paper discusses the research process, the problems addressed and the way results were shared and acted upon within the company.</p>
<p>Findings - The findings show how the search for and implementation of the combination of observation and introspection is rooted in the kinds of organizational change processes that allow companies to appropriate new methodological approaches and modify the conduct of their service innovation processes.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - The paper is based on a single research project, analysed only retrospectively and reflexively. As to its implications, the proposed qualitative methods help mediate the collaborative interaction between researchers and the company during a research project.</p>
<p>Practical implications - The research findings already have been appropriated and used by a multidisciplinary working group, operating within a corporate environment. Similarly, other companies can manage this type of research process following three major guidelines: prepare the cultural background, be iterative and maintain a conversation.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The paper offers a unique account of the process of using combined qualitative methods within a company to understand consumer experiences.</p>"

The experimental results confirm the theoretical prediction of a positive correlation between the voter's risk aversion and the corresponding preferred majority threshold. Furthermore, the experimental results show that a voter's preferred majority threshold negatively relates to the voter's confidence about how others will vote. Moreover, in a treatment in which individuals receive a private signal about others' voting behaviour, the confidence-related motivation of behaviour loses ground to the signal's strength.</p>"

<p>This paper contrasts measures of teacher effectiveness with the students' evaluations for the same teachers using administrative data from Bocconi University. The effectiveness measures are estimated by comparing the performance in follow-on coursework of students who are randomly assigned to teachers. We find that teacher quality matters substantially and that our measure of effectiveness is negatively correlated with the students' evaluations of professors. A simple theory rationalizes this result under the assumption that students evaluate professors based on their realized utility, an assumption that is supported by additional evidence that the evaluations respond to meteorological conditions.

<p>We examine whether the dynamics of the implied volatility surface of individual equity options contains exploitable predictability patterns. Predictability in implied volatilities is expected due to the learning behavior of agents in option markets. In particular, we explore the possibility that the dynamics of the implied volatility surface of individual stocks may be associated with movements in the volatility surface of S&P 500 index options. We present evidence of strong predictable features in the cross-section of equity options and of dynamic linkages between the volatility surfaces of equity and S&P 500 index options. Moreover, time-variation in stock option volatility surfaces is best predicted by incorporating information from the dynamics in the surface of S&P 500 options. We analyze the economic value of such dynamic patterns using strategies that trade straddle and delta-hedged portfolios, and find that before transaction costs such strategies produce abnormal risk-adjusted returns.

<p>We study a mean-risk model derived from a behavioral theory of Disappointment with multiple reference points. One distinguishing feature of the risk measure is that it is based on mutual deviations of outcomes, not deviations from a specific target. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for strict first and second order stochastic dominance, and show that the model is, in addition, a Convex Risk Measure. The model allows for richer, and behaviorally more plausible, risk preference patterns than competing models with equal degrees of freedom, including Expected Utility (EU), Mean-Variance (M-V), Mean-Gini (M-G), and models based on non-additive probability weighting, such as Dual Theory (DT). In asset allocation, the model allows a decision-maker to abstain from diversifying in a positive expected value risky asset if its performance does not meet a certain threshold, and gradually invest beyond this threshold, which appears more acceptable than the extreme solutions provided by either EU and M-V (always diversify) or DT and M-G (always plunge). In asset trading, the model provides no-trade intervals, like DT and M-G, in some, but not all, situations. An illustrative application to portfolio selection is presented. The model can provide an improved criterion for mean-risk analysis by injecting a new level of behavioral realism and flexibility, while maintaining key normative properties. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<p>Purpose - This paper aims to present and discuss some quantitative results obtained in assessing the economic impact of variations in tourism flows, induced by climate change, for some Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - Estimates by a regional climate model are used to build a tourism climate index, which indicates the suitability of climate, in certain locations, for general outdoor activities. As climate change is expected to affect a number of variables like temperature, wind and precipitation, it will have consequences on the degree of attractiveness of touristic destinations. The authors estimate the macroeconomic consequences of changing tourism flows by means of a computable general equilibrium model.</p>
<p>Findings - The authors found that more incoming tourists will increase income and welfare, but this phenomenon will also induce a change in the productive structure, with a decline in agriculture and manufacturing, partially compensated by an expansion of service industries. The authors found that, in most countries, the decline in agriculture entails a lower demand for water, counteracting the additional demand for water coming from tourists and bringing about a lower water consumption overall.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - A great deal of uncertainty affects, in particular: estimates of future climate conditions, especially for variables different from temperature, the relationship between climate and tourist demand, and its interaction with socio-economic variables. This also depends on the reliability of the TCI index as an indicator of climate suitability for tourism, on its application to spatially and temporally aggregated data, on the degree of responsiveness of tourism demand to variations in the TCI. Furthermore, as the authors followed here a single region approach, the authors were not able to consider in the estimates the impact of climate change on the global tourism industry. Nonetheless, the authors believe that a quantitative analysis like the one presented here is not without scope. First, it provides an order of magnitude for the impact of climate change on tourism and the national economy. Second, it allows to assess systemic and second-order effects, which are especially relevant in this context and, moreover, appear to be sufficiently robust to alternative model specifications. In other words, the value added of this study does not lie in the specific figures obtained by numerical computations, but on the broader picture emerging from the overall exercise.</p>
<p>Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study in which, by assessing higher tourism attractiveness into a general equilibrium framework, the effect described above is detected and highlighted.</p>"

<p>Family firms play a significant role in the global economy. Consistently, over the last two decades academia has turned its attention to the family dimension as a determinant of business phenomena, and this interest has increased over time. While family business research has reached an age of 'adolescence' as a field of study, accounting research to date seems to have been rather slow to pick up on the distinctive characteristics of family firms, and their implications for accounting and reporting practices. In an attempt to accelerate and support research in the field, in this article we highlight theoretical and empirical challenges that accounting scholars need to consider when addressing issues related to accounting and reporting in family firms. These challenges include the selection and potential mixing of appropriate theoretical frameworks, and complications in defining operationally what family firms are. We also provide a 'state of the art' of studies in financial accounting, management accounting and auditing, identifying which issues in relation to family firms have been addressed in the research, and which theories, research methods and types of data have been used in these studies. We conclude by providing directions for future research that can advance our understanding of accounting and reporting in family firms.</p>"

Using socioemotional wealth as a theoretical framework and considering the different implications of REM and ABEM on family firms' transgenerational sustainability, we hypothesise and find for a sample of 402 German listed family firms during 1998-2008 that family firms engage less in REM and exhibit more earnings-decreasing ABEM policies as compared to a sample of 436 non-family firms. We further provide evidence that family firms as compared to non-family firms treat REM and ABEM as substitute rather than complementary tools for earnings management. Overall, our findings suggest that family firms use earnings management activities strategically, avoiding those that inhibit the firm's long-term value (i.e. REM) and engaging in those that help families retain transgenerational control (i.e. ABEM).</p>"

<p>We investigate the effect that exchange rate regimes have on the degree of central bank involvement in banking supervision. Using both de jure and de facto exchange rate regimes, we find that, conditional on several other factors affecting supervisory power allocation, policymakers are more willing to delegate this task to central banks when the latter are pegging their currency to some kind of parity. This evidence is confirmed when instrumental variables are added, in order to account for possible endogeneity. Results suggest that exchange rate regime features can mitigate the trade offs that political authorities face in evaluating the possibility of assigning supervision to monetary authorities.</p>"

We show that the transmission is asymmetric depending on the extention of the deviation of the actual policy rate from the one required by the Taylor rule. When the policy stance is tight-actual rate is higher than the one implied by the Taylor rule contractionary shocks have stronger negative effects on output and prices.</p>"

Following Raffo and Lhuillery (Res Policy 38:1617-1627, 2009) we describe disambiguation as a three step process: cleaning&parsing, matching, and filtering. By means of sensitivity analysis, based on MonteCarlo simulations, we show how various filtering criteria can be manipulated in order to obtain optimal combinations of precision and recall (type I and type II errors). We also show how these different combinations generate different results for applications to studies on inventors' productivity, mobility, and networking; and discuss quality issues related to linguistic issues. The filtering criteria based upon information on inventors' addresses are sensitive to data quality, while those based upon information on co-inventorship networks are always effective. Details on data access and data quality improvement via feedback collection are also discussed.</p>"

Savers rely on trusted intermediaries to manage their wealth (claims on capital stock), who can charge fees above costs to trusting investors. In this model, the ratio of financial income to GDP increases with the ratio of aggregate wealth to GDP. Both rise along the convergence path to steady state growth. We examine several further implications of the model for management fees, unit costs of finance, and the consequences of shocks to trust and to the capital stock.</p>"

<p>Although foundational organization theory recognized the role of both formal and informal elements, for the past two decades scholarship appears to have primarily attended to the role of informal social structures (i.e. social networks) in explaining organizational functioning. This trend, however, has left a disconnect between the literatures on formal organization and informal social structure such that crucial questions and problems at the intersection of the two streams of research have been neglected. In this essay, we make the case for rediscovering the inherent interplay between formal organization and informal social structure given their common basis of interactions in organizations. We argue that by bridging the gap between formal organization and informal social structure scholarship we can advance our understanding of both the origins and evolution of social networks and the design and effective functioning of organizations. As a first step towards achieving greater integration of research on formal organization and informal social structure we: consolidate existing scholarly understanding in this area, profile the few studies that have begun to bridge the disconnect between formal and informal elements, identify conceptual logics for linking formal and informal elements, and propose an agenda for future research.</p>"

<p>Regional Studies. This paper studies the link between regional disparities and migration flows, focusing on the skill content of migration. Disparities may lead to migration, which should reduce them; but at the same time if migration is skill-selective, it may have an opposite effect and reinforce the richest regions. The object of this empirical analysis is Italy, a country where unskilled interregional migration flows were a large and very well-known phenomenon during the 1950s and 1970s, whilst in recent years, after three decades of very low labour mobility, thousands of Southern graduates have been moving to Northern regions. What is the economic impact of those flows of selective migration? Using data covering the period 1980-2001, it is found that although a slight process of convergence occurred between Italian regions, the loss of human capital in the South was detrimental to regional growth.</p>"

<p>This paper uses a multi-factor pricing model with time-varying risk exposures and premia to examine whether the 2003-2006 period has been characterized, as often claimed by a number of commentators and policymakers, by a substantial mispricing of publicly traded real estate assets (REITs). The estimation approach relies on Bayesian methods to model the latent process followed by risk exposures and idiosynchratic volatility. Our application to monthly, 1979-2009 U.S. data for stock, bond, and REIT returns shows that both market and real consumption growth risks are priced throughout the sample by the cross-section of asset returns. There is weak evidence at best of structural mispricing of REIT valuations during the 2003-2006 sample.</p>"

<p>We analyze the effects of the introduction of gender quotas in candidate lists on the quality of elected politicians, as measured by the average number of years of education. We consider an Italian law which introduced gender quotas in local elections in 1993, and was abolished in 1995. As not all municipalities went through elections during this period, we identify two groups of municipalities and use a Difference in differences estimation. We find that gender quotas are associated with an increase in the quality of elected politicians, with the effect ranging from 0.12 to 0.24 years of education. This effect is due not only to the higher number of elected women, who are on average more educated than men, but also to the lower number of low-educated elected men. The positive effect on quality is confirmed when we measure the latter with alternative indicators, it persists in the long run and it is robust to controlling for political ideology and political competition.

Additionally, it provides (i) disease-specific information to better understand the rational of investments in NDs, (ii) yearly data, to understand the investment trends. The search identified 650 clinical studies. Leishmaniasis, Arbovirus infection, and Dengue are the top three diseases by number of clinical studies. Disease diffusion risk seems to be the most important driver of the clinical trials target choice, whereas the role played by disease prevalence and unmet need is controversial. Number of trials is stable between 2005 and 2010, with an increase in the last two years. Patient recruitment was completed for most studies (57.6%), and Phases II and III account for 35% and 28% of trials, respectively. The primary purpose of clinical investigations is prevention (49.3%), especially for infectious diseases with mosquitoes and sand flies as the vector, and treatment (43.2%), which is the primary target for parasitic diseases Research centres and public organisations are the most important clinical studies sponsors (58.9%), followed by the pharmaceutical industry (24.1%), foundations and non-governmental organisations (9.3%). Many coordinator centres are located in less affluent countries (43.7%), whereas OECD countries and BRICS account for 34.7% and 17.5% of trials, respectively. Information was partially missing for some parameters. Notwithstanding, and despite its descriptive nature, this research has enhanced the evidence of the literature on pipelines for NDs. Future contributions may further investigate whether trials metrics are consistent with the characteristics of the interested countries and the explicative variables of trials location, target (disease) choice, and the object of the trials.</p>"

<p>Objective Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa have implemented policies to remove or reduce user fees. Our aim was to identify criteria guiding such decisions among national policy entrepreneurs, those who link up problem definition, solution development and political processes.</p>
<p>Methods We administered a best-worst scaling (BWS) experiment to 89 policy entrepreneurs, asking them to identify the most and the least important criteria on a series of predefined sets. Sets were compiled using a Balance Incomplete Block Design which generated random combinations of all 11 criteria included in the experiment. In turn, those had emerged from a prior set of focus group discussions organized among policy entrepreneurs. Ordered logit models were used to investigate the value of single criteria as well as heterogeneity of preferences.</p>
<p>Results Political commitment was identified as the most important criterion guiding policy decisions on user fee abolition or reduction to the overall sample, but particularly so for more experienced respondents aged over 50 years. International pressure and donor money were identified as least important while equity and institutional capacity were deemed of relatively little importance. Respondents more involved in advising on policy than on formulating policy rated economic issues such as financial sustainability and cost-effectiveness as less important.</p>
<p>Conclusions It is feasible to apply BWS experiments in low-income countries, although whether the technique can be adjusted to elicit preferences among non-literate respondents in these settings is unclear.</p>"

<p>Interest in issues associated with environmental sustainability is continuously growing and sustainable consumption is now a mainstream topic at the top of the international public administration agenda. However, the many studies about the general inconsistency between green consumer attitudes and green consumption have not considered two individual differences that seem to be interesting in order to explain the ethical consumer attitude-intention gap: regulatory focus and time horizon. Regulatory focus, being the strategic orientation individuals use to pursue their goals, might enhance consumers' sense of duty towards environmental issues. Time horizon represents the consumers' perceived time lag between their decision and its outcome, and can induce them to immediately engage in a specific behaviour. With this goal in mind, the present work illustrates the results of three experimental studies that focus on individual differences (regulatory focus and time horizon) that might influence consumers to comply with green consumption. Results show that prevention-focused individuals demonstrate a higher compliance with green behaviour, both in the short-term and in the long-term outcome horizons.</p>"

<p>Over the past two decades, activation has become a rather fashionable European trend for policies in the area of welfare and work, facilitating the job inclusion especially of the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups. The activation paradigm implies important challenges for related policy fields and the organisational provision of individualised, client-centred training, skills development and counselling services. The main aim of this Supplement is to shed new light on the ways through which activation strategies have been translated in policies and new governance arrangements. More specifically, the five articles in this Supplement deal with two essential challenges of current activation policies: (i) the tightrope walk between cost-effectiveness and comprehensive support; and (ii) the different facets and combinations of systemic coordination, collaboration, marketisation, decentralisation and individualisation.</p>"

<p>In the current economic crisis, social movements are simultaneously facing two types of challenges: first, they are confronting institutions which are less able (or willing) to mediate new demands for social justice and equity emerging from various sectors of society, and second, given the highly individualised structure of contemporary society, they are also experiencing difficulties in building bonds of solidarity and cooperation among people, bonds which are a fundamental resource for collective action. It is in this context that protests waves, which may be very relevant, are in fact often short-lived, and it is in this context that we detect the rise and consolidation of new mutualistic and cooperative experiences within which (similarly to the past) new ties and frames for collective action are created. This article discusses and analyses social movement organisations which focus on both the intensification of economic problems and the difficulties of rebuilding social bonds and solidarity within society, emphasising solidarity and the use of 'alternative' forms of consumption as means to re-embed the economic system within social relations, starting from the local level. While discussing what is new and/or what has been renewed in new Sustainable Community Movement Organisations, the article will develop an analytical framework which will combine social movements and political consumerism theories by focusing on two basic dimensions: consumer culture and identity and organisational resources and repertoire of action.</p>"

<p>A burgeoning literature in psychology and economics examines how personality characteristics predict indicators of attained status. We build on this research by suggesting that connections between personality and attained status are also socially contingent: Valued personality characteristics are stronger predictors of attainments at lower levels of parent education (the resource substitution hypothesis), but such characteristics are less likely among the children of less educated parents (the structural amplification hypothesis). We examine these possibilities by drawing on the Mini-IPIP (a standardized instrument assessing personality), the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, and a statistical framework to test for moderated mediation. Results reveal that (1) personality characteristics have notable associations with educational attainment, hourly wages, and self-direction at work; (2) personality often has stronger associations with status attainments at lower levels of parent education; and (3) personality is a weak mediator of associations between parent education and attained status. That is, the children of less educated parents may benefit more from valued personality characteristics, but they are slightly less likely to possess such characteristics. These results are discussed in terms of new avenues for research into diverse forms of capital and status attainment.</p>"

<p>The recent analysis developed by William Page on the U. S. notion of concerted actions raised the idea to develop an article that parses in depth the EU meaning of concerted practices and that skein of U. S. doctrines that focuses on phenomena from invitations to collude to multilateral facilitating practices. According to Page, the current definition of concerted actions in the U. S. legal system misses the opportunity to use inter-firm communications to differentiate cases of collusive pricing practices and cases of interdependent parallel behavior that results in the same market price. On the contrary, the current EU definition of concerted practices accomplishes this purpose. By characterizing strategic inter-firm contacts as one of its building blocks, the EU definition supplies antitrust enforcers with a theoretical tool that distinguishes unlawful collusive conduct from oligopolistic non-coordinated behavior. Yet the current EU definition of concerted practices does something more. By encompassing a very strong presumption-that firms exchanging strategic information cannot do anything else but accordingly shape their internal pricing decisions-this notion catches cartels that emerge only from these strategic inter-firm contacts, regardless of firms' actual pricing conduct. The current EU notion of concerted practices is thus a powerful prosecuting tool that deserves to be compared with the U. S. case law about interdependence, parallelism, and exchanges of information.</p>"

<p>The evidence-based paradigm is increasingly permeating the spheres of policymaking and management in health care, as it has in most other public domains. An emerging stream of research has investigated how different institutional arrangements are more (or less) conducive to an effective evidence-based policy. We contribute to this stream through a multiple-case design on governing technological innovation. In particular, the study examines the dynamics through which policymakers have governed the adoption of the Da Vinci robot within the Italian health care system. The analysis leads to the elaboration of four archetypes for governing through evidence, the common mechanisms of which are systematized in an emerging theory. The framework developed here suggests that governing through evidence entails selecting or combining a variety of evidentiary bases, structuring a new relational arrangement among the actors involved, and standardizing decisional criteria and procedures. Combining these elements with the specific governing output sought by policymakers explains the different steering capabilities of institutional arrangements in practice.</p>"

<p>Resilience - a firm's ability to adapt, endure, quickly bounce back, and then thrive despite a catastrophic event - addresses diverse managerial constructs including performance (Carmeli & Markman, 2011). Our exploratory study expands this line of research by making two contributions: first, we develop and test a new revelatory measure for resilience - VOLARE - combining financial performance measures with volatility data. Then, applying this new measure to the financial industry, from 2002 to 2011, we identify highly resilient international financial services firms (IFSFs; e.g., banks) and compare them with less resilient IFSFs. Second, we assess three factors - bank size, home-market solidity, and product and market complexity - that the literature has traditionally shown to be highly predictive of banks' performance. Consistent with our expectations, the results corroborate that VOLARE is complementary to, but distinct from, traditional financial measures of firm performance. We explain these deviations from traditional studies and suggest further research topics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>We study type spaces where a player's type at a state is a conditional probability on the space. We axiomatize these spaces using conditional belief operators, examining three additional axioms of increasing strength. First, introspection, which requires the agent to be unconditionally certain of her beliefs. Second, echo, according to which the unconditional beliefs implied by the condition must be held given the condition. Third, determination, which says that the conditional beliefs are the unconditional beliefs that are conditionally certain. Echo implies that conditioning on an event is the same as conditioning on the event being certain, which formalizes the standard informal interpretation of conditional probability. The game-theoretic application of our model, discussed within an example, sheds light on a number of issues in the analysis of extensive form games. Type spaces are closely related to the sphere models of counterfactual conditionals and to models of hypothetical knowledge. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Incentive regulation in electricity distribution is expected to enlarge its scope, from an input-oriented instrument to one that includes additional, output-based incentives. This creates a potential conflict with more traditional concerns for productive efficiency. In the case of Italy, together with input-oriented instruments, output-based incentives have been applied to indicators of quality for over a decade. Using micro-data from the largest Italian distribution company, we conduct an assessment of the effects of this regulatory framework. The aim of this work is threefold. First, we measure performance in terms of cost-efficiency and find that similar cost-reducing efforts were exercised in all distribution units. Second, we measure performance with respect to the overall regulatory framework. Using quality-related rewards and penalties, we find that more cost-efficient areas were also more successful in earning rewards/avoiding penalties: favorable external conditions have similar, positive effects on both cost and quality performance. Using the cost of the energy not supplied, we find no evidence of a conflict between cost efficiency and social cost efficiency. Results indicate, however, that itis preferable to use social costs when measuring a single unit's performance. From these results we derive specific policy indications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We construct rating- and maturity-based weekly bond portfolios using TRACE and simulate monetary policies as shocks to the Treasury yield curve. We find that none of the policies can persistently lower corporate spreads, and that operation twist is the only policy capable of lowering corporate yields. This latter finding can be accounted for by the operation twist's ability to keep the monetary base constant and, therefore, to flatten the riskless yield curve without generating inflationary expectations.

More recently, scholars have hypothesized that norms of knowledge use may indirectly promote it. In this article, we synthesize a theoretical framework of the effect of norms of knowledge use and test its predictions by means of a field experiment involving more than 500 Italian chefs. For the literature on knowledge transfer, we confirm the importance of norms, but we also show that they are not complete substitutes for other means of protecting private knowledge. For the literature on social norms, we provide evidence of how actors assess others' propensity to conform and how this influences the intention to participate in the norm-regulated exchange.

<p>Monotonic transformations are widely employed in statistics and data analysis. In computer experiments they are often used to gain accuracy in the estimation of global sensitivity statistics. However, one faces the question of interpreting results that are obtained on the transformed data back on the original data. The situation is even more complex in computer experiments, because transformations alter the model input-output mapping and distort the estimators. This work demonstrates that the problem can be solved by utilizing statistics which are monotonic transformation invariant. To do so, we offer an investigation into the families of metrics either based on densities or on cumulative distribution functions that are monotonic transformation invariant and we introduce a new generalized family of metrics. Numerical experiments show that transformations allow numerical convergence in the estimates of global sensitivity statistics, both invariant and not, in cases in which it would otherwise be impossible to obtain convergence. However, one fully exploits the increased numerical accuracy if the global sensitivity statistic is monotonic transformation invariant. Conversely, estimators of measures that do not have this invariance property might lead to misleading deductions.</p>"

<p>AimsThis multi-centre prospective field study evaluated whether peripheral venous catheter site of insertion influences the risk of catheter-related phlebitis. Potential predictors of phlebitis were also investigated.</p>
<p>BackgroundMillions of patients worldwide use peripheral venous catheters, which frequently cause local complications including phlebitis, infection and obstruction. Although phlebitis predictors have been broadly investigated, uncertainties remain on the potential effect of cannulation anatomical site, duration and the appropriate time for catheter removal.</p>
<p>DesignA prospective cohort design was carried out from January-June 2012.</p>
<p>MethodsThe clinical course of each patient who received a new peripheral venous catheter for any cause in five Italian hospitals was followed by trained nurses until catheter removal. The presence of phlebitis was assessed every 24hours using the Visual Infusion Phlebitis score. Analyses were based upon multilevel mixed-effects regression.</p>
<p>ResultsThe final sample consisted of 1498 patients. The average time for catheters in situ was 656hours and 236% of the catheters were in place beyond 96hours. Overall phlebitis incidence was 154%, 944% of which were grade 1. The likelihood of phlebitis independently increased with increasing catheter duration, being highest after 96hours. Compared with patients with catheter placed in the dorsum of the hand (228% of the sample), those with the catheter located in the antecubital fossa (341%) or forearm were less likely to have a phlebitis of any grade.</p>
<p>ConclusionsAntecubital fossa and forearm veins may be preferential sites for peripheral venous cannulation. Our results support Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations to replace catheters in adults no later than 96hours. A relevant proportion of healthcare personnel did not adhere to such guidelines - more attention to this issue is required.</p>"

<p>Objectives: Licensing of, and coverage decisions on, new therapies should rely on evidence from patient-relevant endpoints such as overall survival (OS). Nevertheless, evidence from surrogate endpoints may also be useful, as it may not only expedite the regulatory approval of new therapies but also inform coverage decisions. It is, therefore, essential that candidate surrogate endpoints be properly validated. However, there is no consensus on statistical methods for such validation and on how the evidence thus derived should be applied by policy makers.</p>
<p>Methods: We review current statistical approaches to surrogate-endpoint validation based on meta-analysis in various advanced-tumor settings. We assessed the suitability of two surrogates (progression-free survival [PFS] and time-to-progression [TTP]) using three current validation frameworks: Elston and Taylor's framework, the German Institute of Quality and Efficiency in Health Care's (IQWiG) framework and the Biomarker-Surrogacy Evaluation Schema (BSES3).</p>
<p>Results: A wide variety of statistical methods have been used to assess surrogacy. The strength of the association between the two surrogates and OS was generally low. The level of evidence (observation-level versus treatment-level) available varied considerably by cancer type, by evaluation tools and was not always consistent even within one specific cancer type.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Not in all solid tumors the treatment-level association between PFS or TTP and OS has been investigated. According to IQWiG's framework, only PFS achieved acceptable evidence of surrogacy in metastatic colorectal and ovarian cancer treated with cytotoxic agents. Our study emphasizes the challenges of surrogate-endpoint validation and the importance of building consensus on the development of evaluation frameworks.</p>"

<p>This article extends the literature on CEO succession and financial performance by addressing corporate owners' mixed motives and desires to protect their interest in being in business. We draw on a Socio-Emotional Wealth (SEW) perspective to investigate how the choice of one of three succession mechanisms - relay succession, horse races' among internal CEO candidates, and hiring from outside - may effectively balance trade-offs between corporate owners' non-financial SEW motives and the firm's financial performance. We find that implementing one of these succession mechanisms reduces the negative impact that typically characterizes CEO transitions in family firms. We also show that family presence on the board of directors offsets the benefits of having selected these balancing succession mechanisms, in either placing too much emphasis on SEW, or creating negative dynamics that make the chosen succession mechanisms less effective.</p>"

<p>Childcare arrangements are key in women's ability to juggle motherhood and work outside the home. As such, the study of access to childcare and its use is of great policy relevance. We focus on a particular kind of informal childcare, the one provided by grandparents. Empirically, assessing the effect of grandparental childcare is not an easy task due to unobserved preferences. In light of the potential outcome framework, we interpret the biases resulting from unobserved preferences as arising from the non-compliance of mothers to the availability of grandparents and from preferences of grandparents for activities other than childcare. Using an instrumental variable approach on Italian data, we find that the effect of grandparental childcare on mothers' labour supply is positive, statistically significant and economically relevant. The effect is stronger for less educated mothers, with young children and living in northern and central Italy.</p>"

<p>Different models have tried to improve the Capital Asset Pricing Model findings, on the basis that different factors can affect asset return. This paper examines a series of explanatory factors, broader than those explained by traditional theory, to see whether they are able to more accurately explain the returns. Should the previous point be confirmed, we must consider that the risk of an asset depends on multiple factors, rather than the few that are usually identified in the literature. Even though more than 300,000 factors are examined in this paper, the results show that in recent years just 87 factors are able to fully explain the returns of 4,500 companies in the 15 European countries examined. Our analysis also shows that business and macroeconomic, rather than financial factors, are those that heavily bear on asset returns; and that factors that affect asset return, either only positively or only negatively, do not exist. However, the same factor can affect some companies positively and others negatively. Thus, since not all firms are always sensitive to the same factors, there is the possibility to further decrease risk in proportion to return, through a factor-based risk optimisation process.</p>"

<p>This article suggests a procedure to derive stochastic population forecasts adopting an expert-based approach. As in previous work by Billari et al. (2012), experts are required to provide evaluations, in the form of conditional and unconditional scenarios, on summary indicators of the demographic components determining the population evolution: that is, fertility, mortality, and migration. Here, two main purposes are pursued. First, the demographic components are allowed to have some kind of dependence. Second, as a result of the existence of a body of shared information, possible correlations among experts are taken into account. In both cases, the dependence structure is not imposed by the researcher but rather is indirectly derived through the scenarios elicited from the experts. To address these issues, the method is based on a mixture model, within the so-called Supra-Bayesian approach, according to which expert evaluations are treated as data. The derived posterior distribution for the demographic indicators of interest is used as forecasting distribution, and a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is designed to approximate this posterior. This article provides the questionnaire designed by the authors to collect expert opinions. Finally, an application to the forecast of the Italian population from 2010 to 2065 is proposed.</p>"

The authors study 145 spinoffs and 121 buyouts that occurred in the United States between 1996 and 2005. Analysis provides three critical findings. First, spinoffs have higher profits in the two years after divestiture; afterwards, buyouts have higher profits. Second, strategic emphasis (investment in R&D versus marketing) is the mechanism that explains the diverging profitability of spinoffs and buyouts over time. Third, this occurs through two routes: a one-step mediated effect via strategic emphasis; a two-step mediated effect via strategic emphasis and radicalness.

The analysis reveals that licensing introduces a selection mechanism which is effective in preventing entry of inefficient players in markets with large ex ante heterogeneity. Furthermore, because in the second case excessive entry is reduced as the degree of heterogeneity increases, our analysis lends support to a policy that simultaneously relaxes entry and price restrictions.</p>"

<p>Scientific breakthroughs coming from universities can contribute to the emergence of new industries, such as in the case of biotechnology. Obviously, not all research conducted in universities leads to a radical change from existing technological trajectories. Patents and patent dynamics have long been recognized as critical in understanding the emergence of new technologies and industries. Specifically, patent citations provide insight into the originality of a discovery that has received patent protection. Yet while a large body of literature addresses the impact of patent originality on various firm performance measures, we address the question of what conditions drive patent originality in the process of knowledge creation within the university. Using data on patented cancer research, we examine how research context - as reflected by the funding source for each scientist is associated with patent originality. We find that when university scientists are partly funded by their own university, they have a higher propensity to generate more original patents. By contrast, university scientists funded either by industry or other non-university organizations have a lower propensity to generate more original patents. The significance of our findings in the cancer research setting call for further research on this question in other research fields. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Many eco-innovations have been linked to technical change in the ICT domain. Leveraging the distinctive features of general purpose technologies, ICT have the potential to steer green growth and to help decouple this growth from ecological damage. The paper aims to shed light on innovation dynamics in this emerging sector by investigating the patterns of innovation in the green IT domains using granted EPO patent data from 1986 to 2006. By means of a network analysis, it identifies existing green ICT domains and examines the characteristics of innovative activity in these domains, focusing in particular on growth and technological pervasiveness, as well as on the variety of innovators. Results indicate that the innovative activity in green ICT domains is characterised by high growth and high levels of technological pervasiveness, considerable entry of new innovators and a variety of actors with a prevalence of large ICT firms and universities. However, the analysis highlights the existence of three different clusters emerging fields, established fields and mature fields that are defined by different structures of innovative activities and by different technological opportunities.

In the first regime characterized by low ex-post returns and high volatility, the risk-return relation is reversed, whereas the intuitive positive risk-return trade-off holds in the second regime.

We find evidence that, for almost half of the fifty-five pairs under investigation, the crisis has left spreads much more correlated than they were previously. This evidence is particularly strong for liquidity- and default-risk-related spreads, long-term spreads, and the spreads that were most likely directly affected by policy interventions.

<p>Most papers in the portfolio choice literature have examined linear predictability frameworks based on the idea that simple but flexible Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models can be expanded to produce portfolio allocations that hedge against the bull and bear dynamics typical of financial markets through careful selection of predictor variables that capture business cycles and market sentiment. Yet, a distinct literature exists that shows that non-linear econometric frameworks, such as Markov switching, are also natural tools to compute optimal portfolios arising from the existence of good and bad market states. This paper examines whether and how simple VARs can produce portfolio rules similar to those obtained under a simple Markov switching, by studying the effects of expanding both the order of the VAR and the number/selection of predictor variables included. In a typical stock-bond strategic asset allocation problem for UK data, we compute the out-of-sample certainty equivalent returns for a wide range of VARs and compare these measures of performance with those of non-linear models. We conclude that most VARs cannot produce portfolio rules, hedging demands or (net of transaction costs) out-of-sample performances that approximate those obtained from simple non-linear frameworks.</p>"

<p>In the face of the current crisis, there is growing demand for regulation, often invoked in terms of a 'return to Bretton Woods'. The Bretton Woods Conference of 1944 was indeed the last explicit attempt to define a rule for international settlements. In fact, post-World War II currency negotiations gave place to a confrontation between two alternative visions of the international monetary system. The two plans set forth by the U.S. and by the U.K. embody two alternative principles: the first aims at producing international liquidity on the basis of a reserve currency (White's plan for an International Stabilization Fund); the second aims at providing a pure means and measure for the multilateral clearing of current accounts in the form of a currency unit (Keynes's plan for an International Clearing Union). The former has undoubtedly prevailed. However, it is questionable whether it is the most appropriate way to manage global imbalances. Indeed, the principle eventually embodied in the Bretton Woods system, and persisting even after its demise, tends to identify money with a reserve asset, making possible, and even necessary, the accumulation of global imbalances, despite original intentions to reabsorb them. On the contrary, the principle that inspired the alternative plan was intended to deprive money of the character of a reserve asset, thus making it the rule for international exchanges, rather than an object of regulation among others. This paper outlines the two principles both in historical perspective and in the perspective of future reforms, particularly in relation to the recent proposal by the governor of the People's Bank of China to go back to the principles of the Keynes plan.</p>"

<p>Various national and local policies encouraging healthy eating have recently been proposed. The present review aims to summarize and critically assess nutrition-economic evaluation studies of direct (e. g., diet counseling) and indirect (e. g., food labeling) interventions aimed at improving dietary habits. A systematic literature review was performed by searching 5 databases (PubMed, Ovid Medline, EconLit, Agricola, and Embase) using a combination of diet-related (fat, diet, intake, nutrition) and economics-related (cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit, cost-utility, health economics, economic evaluation) key words. The search yielded 36 studies that varied in target population, study design, economic evaluation method, and health/economic outcome. In general, all provide limited experimental evidence and adopt the framework of economic evaluations in healthcare. Certain important aspects were not well considered: 1) the non-health-related effects of nutrition interventions on well-being; 2) the private nature of food expenditures; 3) the distributional effects on food expenditures across socioeconomic groups; and 4) the general economic implications (e. g., agrofoods, import/export) of such interventions. Overall, the methodology for the economic evaluation of nutrition interventions requires substantial improvement. (C) 2014 International Life Sciences Institute</p>"

<p>The use of health technology assessment (HTA) to inform policy-making is established in most developed countries. Compared to licensing agencies, HTA agencies have different interests and, therefore, different evidence requirements. Criteria for coverage or reimbursement decisions on pharmaceutical compounds vary; however, it is common to include, as part of the HTA, a comparative effectiveness evaluation. This type of clinical data might go beyond that required for market authorization, thus creating an additional evidence gap between the regulatory and the reimbursement submission. The relevance of submissions to HTA agencies is consistently increasing in a pharmaceutical company's perspective, as market prospects are strongly influenced by third-party payers' coverage. In this study, we aim to describe current HTA activities with a potential impact throughout the drug development process of pharmaceuticals, with a comparative emphasis on the systems in place in Italy and in the UK. Based on an extensive literature and website review, we identified three major classes of HTA activities, beyond mainstream HTA, with the potential to influence the drug development program: 1) horizon scanning and early HTA; 2) bipartite and tripartite early dialogue between manufacturers, regulators, and HTA assessors; and 3) managed market entry agreements. From early stages of clinical research up to postauthorization studies, there is a trend toward increased collaboration between parties, anticipation of market access evidence collection, and postmarketing risk-sharing. Heterogeneity of HTA practices increases the complexity of the market access environment. Overall, there are signals that market access departments are gaining importance in the pharmaceutical companies, but there is still a lack of evidence and reporting on how the increasing relevance of HTA has reshaped the way clinical development is designed and managed.</p>"

<p>This article focuses on corporate spinouts as a strategy that can rejuvenate the inventive efforts of inventors with a long tenure in the same company. We rely on an unbalanced panel of 5,604 inventor-year observations to study a matched sample of 431 inventors employed by the Xerox Corporation and find evidence in support of three predictions. First, inventors who join a spinout increase the extent of exploration in their inventive activities. Second, they decrease the extent to which they rely on the parent organization's knowledge. Third, because long-tenured employees, through socialization, tend to progressively adopt more exploitative behavior than short-tenured members, they benefit relatively more from the spinout experience. These results are robust to several econometric specifications that try to account for the endogeneity of the inventors' decision to join the spinout, for the fact that spinouts' inventive activity may be intrinsically different from that of the parent company, and for the possible presence of novel external stimuli for those who join spinouts. The data provide large-sample evidence consistent with the idea that socialization reduces opportunities for organizational learning; we discuss the implications for theory and practice.</p>"

Information was collected through secondary data and semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with family members and the company's top management. The case explores from a theoretical and empirical point of view the entrepreneurial decision-making process and how it affects the evolution of the company strategy.</p>
<p>Findings - The case illustrates the role of founders' (organizational) identity and of social relationships in influencing the diversification of the company and its partnership strategy.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - The research strategy does not allow generalizations.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The case integrates strategic alliances literature highlighting the importance of the nature of the tie existing between companies before the alliance is set and of the decision makers' identity in shaping partnerships' choice. The case is useful in entrepreneurship and managing small or family business courses but also for students attending management of foods and beverage or cultural management courses.</p>"

<p>The way a song sounds depends on, among other things, what instruments are audible to the listener. We document the systematic relationship between instrumentation, or the particular combination of instruments audible in a hit song, and its relative market appeal vis-a-vis its place on the charts. This is accomplished using mixed analytical methods under ecologically valid conditions. The data come from Billboard's Hot 100 weekly popularity rankings from the past 55 years. We compare number 1 singles with songs that never climbed above number 90. First, using Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), we identify two configurations of core instruments that result in a song being more popular such that these configurations are present far more consistently among the set of number 1 hit songs. We also identify three configurations of core instruments that result in a song being less popular such that these configurations are present far more consistently among songs that stagnate at the bottom of the charts. What stands out is popular (less popular) configurations always include (exclude) background vocals. Further, our qualitative results reveal number 1 songs tend to include a greater number of instruments. Second, we utilize logit regression to document how the absolute number of distinct instrument types perceptible in a song affects the chances it will be a number 1 hit as opposed to stay at or below number 90. Our results suggest songs that do not follow conventional instrumentation and instead include an atypically low or high number of instruments are more likely to stand out, becoming number 1 hits. Looking across time, a greater number of instruments increased the chances of being a number1 song during mid-1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s, while fewer instruments increased the chances during the 1960s and in the late 2000s.</p>"

<p>There is a limited understanding of preferences for micro health insurance (MHI) as a strategy for moving towards universal health coverage. Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE), we explored community preferences for the attributes and attribute-levels of a prospective MHI scheme, aimed at filling health coverage gaps in Malawi. Through a qualitative study informed by a literature review, we identified six MHI attributes (and attribute-levels): unit of enrollment, management structure, health service benefit package, copayment levels, transportation coverage, and monthly premium per person. Qualitative data was collected from 12 focus group discussions and 8 interviews in August September, 2012. We constructed a D-efficient design of eighteen choice-sets, each comprising two MHI choice alternatives and an opt-out. Using pictorial images, trained interviewers administered the DCE in March May, 2013, to 814 household heads and/or their spouse(s) in two rural districts. We estimated preferences for attribute-levels and relative importance of attributes using conditional and nested logit models. The results showed that all attribute-levels except management by external NGO significantly influenced respondents' choice behavior (P < 0.05). These included: enrollment as core nuclear family (odds ratio (OR) = 1.1574), extended family (OR = 1.1132), compared to individual; management by community committee (OR = 0.9494) compared to local micro finance institution; comprehensive health service package (OR = 1.4621), medium service package (OR = 1.2761), compared to basic service package; no copayment (OR = 1.1347), 25% copayment (OR = 1.1090), compared to 50% copayment; coverage of all transport (OR = 1.5841), referral and emergency transport (OR = 1.2610), compared to no transport; and premium (OR = 0.9994). The relative importance of attributes is ordered as: transport, health services benefits, enrollment unit, premium, copayment, and management. To maximize consumer utility and encourage community acceptance of MHI, potential MHI schemes should cover transport costs, offer a comprehensive benefit package, define the core family as the unit of enrollment, avoid high copayments, and be managed by a competent financial institution.

<p>We study the effect of corporate culture on the relationship between firm performance and CEO turnover. Utilising a measure of cultural dimension developed in organisation behaviour research, we quantify corporate culture by assessing official documents using a text analysis approach. We employ this quantification to examine the impact of culture on CEO turnover, especially in the case of poor firm-specific performance. First, we find strong evidence of a negative relationship between firm-specific performance and CEO turnover. Second, we demonstrate that the probability of a CEO change, on average, is positively influenced by the competition- and creation-oriented cultures. The negative relationship between firm-specific performance and CEO turnover is reinforced by the control-oriented culture and reduced by the creation-oriented culture. Finally, we study the CEO insider or outsider succession and observe that the creation-oriented culture has a negative relationship with the probability of hiring an outsider. Moreover, the creation-oriented culture weakens the negative relationship existing between the firm-specific performance under the incumbent CEO and the probability of hiring an outsider.

The resulting hierarchical Bayesian procedure, with a fixed prior, is adaptive to the unknown smoothness of the sampling density.</p>"

<p>The global financial crisis had a major impact on the cost and availability of finance for infrastructure-based public-private partnerships (PPPs). In response, policy-makers have introduced models of 'credit-enhancement' that aim to reduce the risk faced by private investors and attract additional capital into the market. Other policies involve hybrid structures in which public capital substitutes for private finance. The emergence of capital constraints in recent years has resulted from increased sensitivity among investors to liquidity risks and capital adequacy regulations, rather than credit risks. Models of credit-enhancement therefore fail to target the source of the problem directly and distort incentive structures. Given liquid and efficient markets for government debt, the authors conclude that a policy in which the provision of public finance is combined with enhanced risk-bearing by private financiers is likely to be optimal.</p>"

<p>Coherent-ambiguity aversion is defined within the (Klibanoff et al., Econometrica 73: 1849-1892, 2005) smooth-ambiguity model (henceforth KMM) as the combination of choice-ambiguity and value-ambiguity aversion. Five ambiguous decision tasks are analyzed theoretically, where an individual faces two-stage lotteries with binomial, uniform, or unknown second-order probabilities. Theoretical predictions are then tested through a 10-task experiment. In (unambiguous) tasks 1-5, risk aversion is elicited through both a portfolio choice method and a BDM mechanism. In (ambiguous) tasks 6-10, choice-ambiguity aversion is elicited through the portfolio choice method, while value-ambiguity aversion comes about through the BDM mechanism. The behavior of over 75% of classified subjects is in line with the KMM model in all tasks 6-10, independent of their degree of risk aversion. Furthermore, the percentage of coherent-ambiguity-averse subjects is lower in the binomial than in the uniform and in the unknown treatments, with only the latter difference being significant.

<p>Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) offer an important tool for rapid organizational growth, acquisition of new knowledge and capabilities, and entry into new markets at home or abroad. Although the importance of the involvement of the human resource management function has been widely extolled, evidence for the level of involvement remains limited. A significant gap in our understanding is created by the observation that not all M&As are motivated by the same objectives. We explore the significance of different forms of M&A for the scope and intensity of involvement of the human resource management function by examining a set of three cases of different M&As conducted by a single firm in Italy. The cases provide evidence that we should expect HR functional involvement to vary across the type of M&A.

In this setting deterrence on actions interacts with deterrence on research. When the practice increases expected welfare the enforcer commits not to intervene by choosing a more rigid per-se legality rule to boost investment, moving to a more flexible discriminating rule combined with type-I accuracy for higher probabilities of social harm. Patent and antitrust policies act as substitutes in our setting; additional room for per-se (illegality) rules emerges when fines are bounded. Our results on optimal legal standards extend from the case of (uncertain) investment in research to the case of (deterministic) investment in physical assets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

<p>Objective: The aims of this study were (1) to investigate the relationship between the main clinical tests to detect spinal instability, the perceived pain and disability, and symptomatic spondylolisthesis (SPL) characteristics, (2) to investigate the relationship between endurance and instability tests, and (3) to measure the diagnostic accuracy of these tests in unstable SPL diagnosed against dynamic radiographs.</p>
<p>Methods: Four instability tests were evaluated on 119 subjects: aberrant movements, active straight leg raising (ASLR), prone instability test, and passive lumbar extension test (PLE); and 2 endurance tests, prone bridge test and supine bridge test (SBT). The results were compared with the numeric rating scale for pain and the Oswestry Disability Index for disability. These tests were used as index tests and compared with dynamic radiographs as reference standard on 64 subjects.</p>
<p>Results: A significant relationship between disability and all the clinical tests but ASLR was observed. The relation between tests and pain was weaker, not significant for prone instability test and aberrant movement and critical for ASLR (P = .05). There was a low relationship between endurance tests and instability tests. Only PLE showed a significant association with dynamic radiographs (P = .017).</p>
<p>Conclusion: Endurance and instability tests appear to be weakly related to the amount of pain but significantly related to the disability in symptomatic SPL. Of the tests evaluated, PLE exhibited the best ability to predict positive dynamic radiographs.</p>"

By using spatial econometrics techniques we demonstrate that the own country effect exists. However, while the within effect is always positive, the between one may be either positive or negative.

<p>This paper determines the optimal ordering policy for a two-product, periodic-review inventory problem in which the probability of supply availability is unknown. Moreover, there are two different fixed costs assigned to each product. Demand rates are random variables with known probability density functions, and the supply availability for each product is updated at the beginning of each time period. We prove the optimality of (s,S) policy with a monotone switching curve that indicates the priority of production, where the order-up-to levels and the reorder points are functions of supply availability information. A simple computation is proposed to calculate the two threshold levels. Bayesian updating helps to manage the optimal ordering policy by updating supply disruption information. Numerical results show that improving the accuracy of the forecast leads to making a better ordering decision and eliminating the negative effect of supply disruption on the total cost.

<p>CLImate-induced changes on WAter and SECurity (CLIWASEC) was a cluster of three complementary EC-FP7 projects assessing climate-change impacts throughout the Mediterranean on: hydrological cycles (CLIMB CLimate-Induced changes on the hydrology of Mediterranean Basins); water security (WASSERMed - Water Availability and Security in Southern EuRope and the Mediterranean) and human security connected with possible hydro-climatic conflicts (CLICO - CLImate change hydro-COnflicts and human security). The Nile delta case study was common between the projects. CLIWASEC created an integrated forum for modelling and monitoring to understand potential impacts across sectors. This paper summarises key results from an integrated assessment of potential challenges to water-related security issues, focusing on expected sea-level rise impacts by the middle of the century. We use this common focus to illustrate the added value of project clustering. CLIWASEC pursued multidisciplinary research by adopting a single research objective: sea-level rise related water security threats, resulting in a more holistic view of problems and potential solutions. In fragmenting research, policy-makers can fail to understand how multiple issues can materialize from one driver. By combining efforts, an integrated assessment of water security threats in the lower Nile is formulated, offering policy-makers a clearer picture of inter-related issues to society and environment. The main issues identified by each project (land subsidence, saline intrusion - CLIMB; water supply overexploitation, land loss - WASSERMed; employment and housing security - CLICO), are in fact related. Water overexploitation is exacerbating land subsidence and saline intrusion, impacting on employment and placing additional pressure on remaining agricultural land and the underdeveloped housing market. All these have wider implications for regional development. This richer understanding could be critical in making better policy decisions when attempting to mitigate climate and social change impacts. The CLIWASEC clustering offers an encouraging path for the new European Commission Horizon 2020 programme to follow. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Differences in college enrollment between poor and rich are striking in Latin America. Explanations such as differences in college preparedness and credit constraints have been advanced. An alternative explanation could be differences in information sets between poor and rich, for example, about career opportunities, translating into different expected returns to college. Poor people might expect low returns and thus decide not to attend or they might face high (unobserved) costs that prevent them from attending despite high expected returns. I use data on people's subjective expectations of returns to address this identification problem. I find that poor individuals require higher expected returns to be induced to attend college than individuals from rich families. Testing predictions of a model of college attendance shows that poor individuals are particularly responsive to changes in direct costs, which is consistent with them being credit constrained. Performing counterfactual policy experiments, I find that a sizeable fraction of poor individuals would change their decision in response to a reduction in direct costs and that these individuals at the margin have expected returns that are as high or higher than the individuals already attending college.</p>"

<p>Evaluating the relative importance of different social contexts in which infection transmission occurs is critical for identifying optimal intervention strategies. Nonetheless, an overall picture of influenza transmission in different social contexts has yet to emerge. Here we provide estimates of the fraction of infections generated in different social contexts during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Italy by making use of a highly detailed individual-based model accounting for time use data and parametrized on the basis of observed age-specific seroprevalence. We found that 41.6% (95% CI: 39-43.7%) of infections occurred in households, 26.7% (95% CI: 21-33.2) in schools, 3.3% (95% CI: 1.7-5%) in workplaces, and 28.4% (95% CI: 24.6-31.9%) in the general community. The above estimates strongly depend on the lower susceptibility to infection of individuals 19 + years old compared to younger ones, estimated to be 0.2 (95% CI 0.12-0.28). We also found that school closure over the weekends contributed to decrease the effective reproduction number of about 8% and significantly affected the pattern of transmission. These results highlight the pivotal role played by schools in the transmission of the 2009 H1N1 influenza. They may be relevant in the evaluation of intervention options and, hence, for informing policy decisions.</p>"

<p>Methods Using data from the repeated Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys in pre-crisis (2005-2007) and post-crisis (2009-2010) periods on a total of 1 981 607 US adults, we separated the expected (after allowance for the demographic growth of the US population, secular smoking prevalence trends and changes in sociodemographic characteristics) from the unexpected (assumed attributable to the economic crisis) changes in the number of smokers across different employment statuses.</p>
<p>Results Joinpoint regression analysis revealed no significant changes in smoking prevalence trends over the period 2005-2010. The crisis resulted in an increase in the number of smokers in the US by 0.6 million. This is largely due to an unexpected decrease of 1.7 million smokers among employed and an increase of 2.4 million smokers among unemployed individuals, whose smoking prevalence also remains extremely high in the post-crisis period (32.6%).</p>
<p>Conclusions The 2008 financial crisis had a weak effect on smoking prevalence. The pro-cyclical relationship (ie, the crisis results in a lower number of smokers) found among the employed is offset by the counter-cyclical relationship (ie, the crisis results in a higher number of smokers) found among unemployed individuals. Public health interventions should specifically target those in unemployment, particularly in hard times.</p>"

<p>While in Hicks's analysis there is the idea of a yield curve normally upward sloping, Keynes does not appear to envisage a systematic positive spread between long-term and short-term interest rates.

<p>Mixed data sampling (MIDAS) regressions allow us to estimate dynamic equations that explain a low frequency variable by high frequency variables and their lags. When the difference in sampling frequencies between the regressand and the regressors is large, distributed lag functions are typically employed to model dynamics avoiding parameter proliferation. In macroeconomic applications, however, differences in sampling frequencies are often small. In such a case, it might not be necessary to employ distributed lag functions. We discuss the pros and cons of unrestricted lag polynomials in MIDAS regressions. We derive unrestricted-MIDAS (U-MIDAS) regressions from linear high frequency models, discuss identification issues and show that their parameters can be estimated by ordinary least squares. In Monte Carlo experiments, we compare U-MIDAS with MIDAS with functional distributed lags estimated by non-linear least squares. We show that U-MIDAS performs better than MIDAS for small differences in sampling frequencies. However, with large differing sampling frequencies, distributed lag functions outperform unrestricted polynomials. The good performance of U-MIDAS for small differences in frequency is confirmed in empirical applications on nowcasting and short-term forecasting euro area and US gross domestic product growth by using monthly indicators.</p>"

The authors employ hierarchical linear modeling and, from an examination of 259 unique movies gathered from 16 countries, corresponding to 2,523 total entries between 2006 and 2007, find significant interaction effects between a country's economic wealth and national culture and time lag and target country position on the new experience product's country-level performance.

<p>Motivating human capital in knowledge-intensive activities is a serious managerial challenge because it is difficult to link rewards to actions or performance. Firms instead might motivate knowledge workers by offering them opportunities to increase personal benefits (e.g., learning, satisfaction) through autonomy in the decision-making process. Our model shows that firms can offer less autonomy in projects closer to their core business: Because firm specialization raises the value of the project's outcomes, it also increases the benefits for knowledge workers, who derive motivation even though they make fewer decisions to support their realization of personal goals. Projects farther from the core offer weaker firm contributions, so firms can motivate knowledge workers by allowing them to benefit from greater autonomy. We discuss several implications of our analysis. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>This paper examines differences in the rate and potential of firms' capability development trajectories. Capability development trajectories are the paths over which firms' capabilities change with experience and other activities. While prior research focused on factors affecting capability development rate (the fraction of the gap between a firm's current and potential capability eliminated with each unit of activity), we argue that capability development trajectories also differ in potential (the maximum capability level a firm could achieve through repeating a given set of activities over time). We develop and estimate a formal model of capability development, showing that larger underwriting projects lead to a lower rate of improvement toward higher potential capabilities, and derive implications for research on industry dynamics and the nature of competitive advantage.

<p>Introduction. Kidney transplantation represents the best therapeutic option for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), providing the best outcomes for survival, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. To increase kidney donations, in 2007, the Italian IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation in Pavia designed and conducted Programma Alba, a protocol for organ donation after cardiac death (DCD). This study evaluated the costs and health outcomes of DCD transplantation and in all types of transplants compared with current clinical practice.</p>
<p>Patients and Methods. A Markov-based model was used to assess costs and health outcomes for new ESRD patients for 2008 to 2013. A health care founder perspective was used. Data sources were the Italian National Institute of Statistics and the Lombardy Registry of Dialysis and Transplantation. A microcosting analysis was performed to calculate costs related to clinical pathways for DCD. We assessed costs, survival, quality-adjusted survival, and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>Findings. Changing the actual practice pattern for new patients with ESRD and increasing the availability of kidneys from DCD to 10 extra transplants per year will induce an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year of (sic)4255. Increases in transplantation to reach an extra 10% by transplant type would result in reduced costs and increased patient survival and quality of life compared with the current scenario.</p>
<p>Interpretation. Our data show that increasing DCD transplants would result in a cost-effective policy to expand the kidney donor pool compared with current ESRD treatment patterns. Italian policies should make an effort to increase transplant rates to optimize cost-effectiveness in ESRD service supply.</p>"

<p>In recent decades, owing to a series of public debt crises and constraints on government expenditure, infrastructure investment has dropped significantly in both developed and developing countries. To counterbalance this trend, Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) schemes have been increasingly adopted. In this paper, we explore the determinants of the degree of private participation in transport infrastructure projects in a large sample of developing countries. By using a large sample of transport projects included in the World Bank Private Participation in Infrastructure Projects database, we document that greater participation by private parties in PPP contracts is associated with better institutions in terms of lower corruption, civil freedom, and a better regulatory framework.

<p>Objective: To evaluate accuracy and cost of non-invasive diagnostic strategies including magnetic resonance imaging, intestinal ultrasonography, ileocolonoscopy and video-capsule endoscopy in suspected Crohn's disease.</p>
<p>Methods: A decision-analytic model was used to assess the costs in low (25%), intermediate (50%) or high (75%) pre-test probability of Crohn's disease. Based on the published accuracy of diagnostic modalities and Bayes rule, we calculated post-test probability of Crohn's disease using different strategies, starting from ileocolonoscopy, ultrasonography or magnetic resonance. Each strategy was considered successful when post-test probability was >95% or <5%.</p>
<p>Results: With low pre-test probability, only ileocolonoscopy as the first investigation could exclude or confirm Crohn's disease while a normal ultrasonography may exclude Crohn's disease. With high pre-test probability, ileocolonoscopy or ultrasonography as the first test may confirm Crohn's disease, but at least 3 negative tests are required to exclude Crohn's disease.</p>
<p>The cost to diagnose one patient was cheapest utilising an ultrasonography-based strategy both in low (ultrasonography (sic)1076; ileocolonoscopy (sic)2005; magnetic resonance (sic)4515) and high pre-test probability of Crohn's disease (ultrasonography (sic)321; ileocolonoscopy (sic)712; magnetic resonance (sic)1412).</p>
<p>Conclusion: The accuracy and cost of these strategies depend on pre-test probability of Crohn's disease and vary according to the first test used. Reocolonoscopy plus ultrasonography is the most accurate and less expensive initial diagnostic strategy. (C) 2014 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation. Published by Elsevier B.V.

<p>Although the research domain of dynamic capabilities has become one of the most active in strategic management, critics have charged that it is plagued by confusion around the construct itself. In this paper, we uncover a potential reason for this confusion embedded in the unique nature of the construct's development path-a peculiarity that has led to split understandings of what constitutes a dynamic capability. We suggest a solution to this problem in the form of an illustrative metaphor-what we call the ""organizational drivetrain."" Our drivetrain represents a theoretical model aimed at combining different views of the definition of dynamic capabilities by explaining how routines and simple rules interact. This shows that it is possible to advance the development of the framework by combining divergent understandings into a coherent whole. We conclude by offering specific recommendations for how to achieve a greater unity of understanding and move the field even further forward.</p>"

<p>Background Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) have been used since the 1980s as a standard health outcome measure for conducting cost-utility analyses, which are often inadequately labeled as 'cost-effectiveness analyses'. This synthetic outcome, which combines the quantity of life lived with its quality expressed as a preference score, is currently recommended as reference case by some health technology assessment (HTA) agencies. While critics of the QALY approach have expressed concerns about equity and ethical issues, surprisingly, very few have tested the basic methodological assumptions supporting the QALY equation so as to establish its scientific validity.</p>
<p>Objectives The main objective of the ECHOUTCOME European project was to test the validity of the underlying assumptions of the QALY outcome and its relevance in health decision making.</p>
<p>Methods An experiment has been conducted with 1,361 subjects from Belgium, France, Italy, and the UK. The subjects were asked to express their preferences regarding various hypothetical health states derived from combining different health states with time durations in order to compare observed utility values of the couples (health state, time) and calculated utility values using the QALY formula.</p>
<p>Results Observed and calculated utility values of the couples (health state, time) were significantly different, confirming that preferences expressed by the respondents were not consistent with the QALY theoretical assumptions.</p>
<p>Conclusions This European study contributes to establishing that the QALY multiplicative model is an invalid measure. This explains why costs/QALY estimates may vary greatly, leading to inconsistent recommendations relevant to providing access to innovative medicines and health technologies. HTA agencies should consider other more robust methodological approaches to guide reimbursement decisions.</p>"

<p>Background: Universal health coverage is high on national health agendas of many countries at the moment. Absence of financial hardship is a key component of universal health coverage and should be monitored regularly. However, relevant household survey data, which is traditionally needed for this analysis is not frequently collected in most countries and in some countries, has not been collected at all. As such, proxy indicators for financial hardship would be very useful.</p>
<p>Methods: We use data from the World Health Survey and use multi-level modeling with national and household level characteristics to see which indicators have a consistent and robust relationship with financial hardship. To strengthen the validity of our findings, we also use different measures of financial hardship.</p>
<p>Results: There are several household level characteristics that seem to have a consistent relationship with financial hardship. However there is only one strong candidate for a proxy indicator at the national level-the share of out-of-pocket payments in total health expenditure. Additionally, the Gini coefficient of total household expenditure was also correlated to financial hardship in most of our models.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The national level indicators related only weakly to the risk of financial hardship. Hence, there should not be an over-reliance on them and collecting good quality household survey data is still a superior option for monitoring financial hardship.</p>"

<p>This study examines how board ownership shapes board processes in family firms. The extant family firm research has extensively adopted an input-output approach to the study of boards, but results have been inconclusive, calling for further research on intervening processes. By examining board ownership, this study shows that board processes are shaped by the life cycles of family firms across generations, as reflected in ownership dispersion among family directors: Cognitive conflict is the highest and the use of knowledge and skills is the lowest when the levels of balance in a board's voting power are moderate, which occurs when the board mostly mirrors a sibling partnership. A discussion of this study's findings contributes to the literature on family firm boards, work groups, and corporate governance.</p>"

<p>The origin and growth of industry clusters have attracted the attention of scholars and policy makers since the early era of industrialisation. The seminal work by Alfred Marshall has represented the foundation for a rich strand of literature, whose late expansion and refinement were inspired by the experiences of localised development in emerging regions. This is the case of Italian industrial districts, which have emerged as a territorial model of industrial agglomeration, decentralised production and flexible specialisation. Recently, the traditional explananda of the emergence of clusters have been reconsidered. The evidence about the growth of clusters in areas that did not have obvious natural advantages, or the first comers' benefits of early agglomeration economies, has inspired a different conceptualisation, which draws consistently from the evolutionary perspective on industrial dynamics. Klepper shows that more successful firms have higher spin-off rates and their spin-offs tend to outperform competitors. Organisational reproduction and heredity are thus identified as the primary forces underlying clustering. The present paper investigates the emergence and evolution of an Italian industrial district, the Sassuolo tile district, one of the largest and most successful ceramic districts in the world and a paradigmatic example of an Italian Marshallian district. Overall, our findings confirm that organisational reproduction and heredity represent primary mechanisms of clustering. However our results also show that spin-offs do not perform better than non-spin-offs. It appears that, in dense industrial environments and social networks, competitive advantages can also be acquired or built through other channels.</p>"

<p>This paper analyzes how asset prices in a binary market react to information when traders have heterogeneous prior beliefs. We show that the competitive equilibrium price underreacts to information when there is a bound to the amount of money traders are allowed to invest. Underreaction is more pronounced when prior beliefs are more heterogeneous. Even in the absence of exogenous bounds on the amount that traders can invest, prices underreact to information provided that traders become less risk averse as their wealth increases. In a dynamic setting, underreaction results in initial momentum and then reversal in the long run.</p>"

<p>An engineering process is an output from a set of combined processes which may be homogeneous or heterogeneous. To study the lifetime of such processes, we need a model which can accommodate the nature of such processes. Single probability models are not capable of capturing the heterogeneity of nature. However, mixture models of some suitable lifetime distributions, have the potential to highlight such interesting feature. Due to time and cost constraint, in the most lifetime testing experiments, censoring is an unavoidable feature of most lifetime data sets. This article deals with the modeling of the heterogeneity existing in the lifetime processes using the mixture of the inverse Rayleigh distribution, and the spotlight is the Bayesian inference of the mixture model using non-informative (the Jeffreys and the uniform) and informative (gamma) priors. We are considering this particular distribution due to two reasons; the first one is due to its skewed behavior, i.e. in engineering processes, an engineer suspects that high failure rate in the beginning, but after continuous inspection, the failure goes down and the second reason is due to its vast application in many applied fields. A Gibbs sampling algorithm based on adaptive rejection sampling is designed for the posterior computation. A detailed simulation study is carried out to investigate the performance of the estimators based on different prior distributions. The posterior risks are evaluated under the squared error, the weighted, the quadratic, the entropy, the modified squared error and the precautionary loss functions. Posterior risks of the Bayes estimates are compared to explore the effect of prior information and loss functions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>In this paper, we discuss a number of ways to define and measure the affordability of energy consumption, and we examine the emergence of energy poverty in Italy in the period from 1998 to 2011. The paper examines the eligibility criteria for claiming the benefits available to support energy consumption for vulnerable families and it identifies the potential beneficiaries. The study assesses the appropriateness of the eligibility criteria by comparing the population targeted by the policy with the population actually facing affordability problems. A simulation exercise, using the hypothetical scenario most likely to result in energy benefits being made available, shows that, regardless of the affordability index adopted, the provision of state energy benefits has little impact on fuel poverty.

<p>This paper provides an overview of the AMPERE modeling comparison project with focus on the implications of near-term policies for the costs and attainability of long-term climate objectives. Nine modeling teams participated in the project to explore the consequences of global emissions following the proposed policy stringency of the national pledges from the Copenhagen Accord and Cancun Agreements to 2030. Specific features compared to earlier assessments are the explicit consideration of near-term 2030 emission targets as well as the systematic sensitivity analysis for the availability and potential of mitigation technologies. Our estimates show that a 2030 mitigation effort comparable to the pledges would result in a further ""lock-in"" of the energy system into fossil fuels and thus impede the required energy transformation to reach low greenhouse-gas stabilization levels (450 ppm CO(2)e). Major implications include significant increases in mitigation costs, increased risk that low stabilization targets become unattainable, and reduced chances of staying below the proposed temperature change target of 2 degrees C in case of overshoot. With respect to technologies, we find that following the pledge pathways to 2030 would narrow policy choices, and increases the risks that some currently optional technologies, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) or the large-scale deployment of bioenergy, will become ""a must"" by 2030.

In an empirical application, we show that the two competing models produce accurate current-quarter forecasts of Italian GDP and of its main demand components, outperforming naive forecasts and comparing favorably with factor models based on all available information.

<p>In 1957, Silvio Rivetti (1921-61), heir to a long-standing Italian entrepreneurial dynasty and owner and manager of Gruppo Finanziario Tessile (GFT), asked Biki (Elvira Leonardi Bouyere, 1906-99) to design sketches for a womenswear collection to be produced by GFT. Conventionally considered by fashion historians as the first example of a collaboration between the fickle world of fashion and rationally planned industrial production, the partnership between the couturiere and the biggest Italian clothing company never really succeeded and eventually resulted in failure, in 1972. The origins and development of the collaboration, its relevance for the evolution of commercial law, the economic value of the GFT collections designed by Biki, and the market response to them are the main topics dealt with in this paper. Based on historical sources unknown until now, it aims to show that the GFT-Biki partnership can be considered a milestone when studying the relationship between fashion and industry.</p>"

<p>Background and purposeThe incidence of hospitalizations, treatment and case fatality of ischaemic stroke were assessed utilizing a comprehensive multinational database to attempt to compare the healthcare systems in six European countries, aiming also to identify the limitations and make suggestions for future improvements in the between-country comparisons.</p>
<p>MethodsNational registers of hospital discharges for ischaemic stroke identified by International Classification of Diseases codes 433-434 (ICD-9) and code I63 (ICD-10), medication purchases and mortality were linked at the patient level in each of the participating countries and regions: Finland, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Scotland and Sweden. Patients with an index admission in 2007 were followed for 1year.</p>
<p>ResultsIn all, 64170 patients with a disease code for ischaemic stroke were identified. The number of patients registered per 100000 European standard population ranged from 77 in Scotland to 407 in Hungary. Large differences were observed in medication use. The age- and sex-adjusted all-cause case fatality amongst hospitalized patients at 1year from stroke was highest in Hungary at 31.0% (95% confidence interval 30.5-31.5). Regional differences in age- and sex-adjusted 1-year case fatality within countries were largest in Hungary (range 23.6%-37.6%) and smallest in the Netherlands (20.5%-27.3%).</p>
<p>ConclusionsIt is feasible to link population-wide register data amongst European countries to describe incidence of hospitalizations, treatment patterns and case fatality of ischaemic stroke on a national level. However, the coverage and validity of administrative register data for ischaemic stroke should be developed further, and population-based and clinical stroke registers should be created to allow better control of case mix.</p>"

<p>This study draws from the knowledge theory of the firm to introduce the release capacity concept to the vendor selection process. The study proposes that suppliers' release capacity - a form of knowledge diffusion that describes the transmission of a sense of a supplier's tacit knowledge to manufacturers - influences their performance during vendor selection. The authors identify two release capacity dimensions: visualization, during which knowledge is embedded and diffused through a visual encoding process, and socialization, during which a sense of the supplier's knowledge is released through a social construction process. The authors use data from the equipment supply industry to empirically test their predictions. The findings show that the release capacity dimensions affect the market's aggregate responses during the formation of consideration sets and preferences. These findings contribute to integrating developments on the source side of the knowledge diffusion process with the vendor selection research tradition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

<p>Autonomy is known for its positive effects and its use in management practice. Recently an urgent debate has emerged on its drawbacks on individual outcomes. In this study, we investigate and test a model on the effect on individual learning of an autonomy-supportive teaching style and its interplay with the learner's previous experience and perceived management support. Specifically, while research has emphasized the positive effect of similar contexts, this study focuses on its differential effect on short-term and long-term learning outcomes, challenging the traditional view of autonomy. We also explore how job experience and management support can improve the effects of autonomy on individual learning. We test our model by collecting longitudinal data on a sample of 200 individuals participating in a training programme on managerial skills. Our results show that (1) the extent to which teachers were perceived as autonomy-supportive presents a linear relationship with short-term learning outcomes (utility reactions) and a positive curvilinear relationship with training transfer in the long term; (2) learner job experience and perceived management support for learning have a positive moderating effect on the linear relationship between autonomy and learning outcomes.</p>"

<p>According to the Rockets and Feathers Hypothesis (RFH), the transmission mechanism of positive and negative changes in the price of crude oil to the price of gasoline is asymmetric. Although there have been many contributions documenting that downstream prices are more reactive to increases than to decreases in upstream prices, little is known about the forecasting performance of econometric models incorporating asymmetric price transmission from crude oil to gasoline. In this paper we fill this gap by comparing point, sign and probability forecasts from a variety of Asymmetric-ECM (A-ECM) and Threshold Autoregressive ECM (TAR-ECM) specifications against a standard ECM. Forecasts from A-ECM and TAR-ECM subsume the RFH, while the ECM implies symmetric price transmission from crude oil to gasoline. We quantify the forecast accuracy gains due to incorporating the RFH in predictive models for the prices of gasoline and diesel. We show that, as far as point forecasts are involved, the RFH does not lead to significant improvements, while it can be exploited to produce more accurate sign and probability forecasts. Finally, we highlight that the forecasting performance of the estimated models is time-varying. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Understanding the interplay between informal care and formal healthcare is important because it sheds light on the financial implications of such interactions and may result in different policies. On the basis of a major database on 532 Italian stroke patients.enrolled in the period 2007-2008, we investigate whether the presence of a potential caregiver and the amount of informal care provided influences the use and the costs of healthcare services, and in particular rehabilitation, in the post-acute phase. Primary caregivers of stroke patients were interviewed at 3, 6 and 12 months after the acute event and use of healthcare and informal care were documented. The panel dataset included socio-demographic, clinical and economic data on patients and caregivers. A longitudinal log-linear model was applied to test the impact of informal care on total healthcare costs in the observation period. A double hurdle model was used to investigate the impact of informal care on rehabilitation costs. A total of 476 of stroke survivors in 44 hospitals were enrolled in the study and presence of informal caregiver was reported in approximately 50% of the sample (range 48.2-52.5% across the three periods). Healthcare costs at 12 months after the acute event are (sic)5825 per patient, with rehabilitation costs amounting to (sic)3985 (68.4%). Healthcare costs are significantly different between the patients with and without caregiver in all three periods. The presence of the caregiver is associated with 54.7% increase in direct healthcare costs (p < 0.01). Instead, the amount of informal care provided does not influence significantly direct healthcare costs. The presence of caregiver significantly increases the probability of access to rehabilitation services (beta = 0.648, p = 0.039) while, once the decision on access is made, it doesn't influence the amount of services used. Our results suggest that informal caregivers facilitate or even promote the access to healthcare services. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This paper studies the cognitive processes that enable decision makers to switch between exploitation and exploration. We use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a sample of expert decision makers to make two main contributions. First, we identify and contrast the specific brain regions and cognitive processes associated with exploitation and exploration decisions. Exploitation activates regions associated with reward seeking, which track and evaluate the value of current choices, while exploration relies on regions associated with attentional control, tracking the value of alternative choices. Second, we propose and test the idea that stronger activation of the brain circuits related to attentional control allows individuals to achieve better decision-making performance as a result. We discuss the implications of these results for strategic management research and practice. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd</p>"

<p>Firms are increasing their investments in collaboration technologies in order to leverage the intellectual resources embedded in their employees. Research on post-adoption use of technology suggests that the true gains from such investments are realized when users explore various system features and attempt to incorporate them into their work practices. However, the literature has been silent about how to promote such behavior when individuals are embedded in team settings, where members' actions are interdependent. This research develops a multilevel model that theorizes the cross-level influence of team empowerment on individual exploration of collaboration technology. Further, it identifies two cognitions-intention to continue exploring and expectation to continue exploring-that are oriented toward exploring ways to incorporate implemented technology into daily work routines over time. A 12-month field study of 212 employees in 48 organizational work teams was conducted to test the multilevel research model. The results provide support for the hypotheses, with team empowerment having a positive cross-level influence on intention to continue exploring and expectation to continue exploring and these, in turn, mediating the cross-level influence of team empowerment on individual exploration of collaboration technology.</p>"

We also expect to observe this sensitivity primarily when the organization has a low level of the intangible asset in question. Based on this framework, we derive specific hypotheses using the differential relationships between reputation and status, as two types of intangible assets, and product quality and revenues, as two types of goals.

<p>We further examine the 'learning-by-exporting' phenomenon, suggesting that firms gain from the learning opportunity of foreign markets, as they make choices that better fit the specific needs of their innovation strategies. We contend that firm size affects these needs, with large firms being more inclined to pursue process innovations, while SMEs focus on product innovations. Using a panel of Spanish firms (1990-2002), we find evidence consistent with our hypotheses. Large firms engage in more process innovation once they enter export markets, with the effect being most pronounced two years after the entry. SMEs, conversely, start pursuing more product innovation before they enter the export markets. This last pattern seems to indicate an 'innovating-for-export-markets' relationship.

However, few studies have considered the intrinsic quality of codes of ethics. This study aims to investigate the impact that specific factors-firm size, degree of internationalization and industry effect-can have on the quality of codes of ethics. Based on a sample of 248 listed Italian companies, the results of the empirical analysis show that the quality standard is particularly high in larger companies and in those firms operating in industries in which relationships established with critical stakeholders-and disclosure to those stakeholders-play a crucial role. These results have interesting implications for both researchers and practitioners.</p>"

<p>In this paper we discuss how the point and density forecasting performance of Bayesian vector autoregressions (BVARs) is affected by a number of specification choices. We adopt as a benchmark a common specification in the literature, a BVAR with variables entering in levels and a prior modeled along the lines of Sims and Zha (International Economic Review 1998; 39: 949-968). We then consider optimal choice of the tightness, of the lag length and of both; evaluate the relative merits of modeling in levels or growth rates; compare alternative approaches to h-step-ahead forecasting (direct, iterated and pseudo-iterated); discuss the treatment of the error variance and of cross-variable shrinkage; and assess rolling versus recursive estimation. Finally, we analyze the robustness of the results to the VAR size and composition (using also data for France, Canada and the UK, while the main analysis is for the USA). We obtain a large set of empirical results, but the overall message is that we find very small losses (and sometimes even gains) from the adoption of specification choices that make BVAR modeling quick and easy, in particular for point forecasting. This finding could therefore further enhance the diffusion of the BVAR as an econometric tool for a vast range of applications. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>We analyze a notion of self-confirming equilibrium with non-neutral ambiguity attitudes that generalizes the traditional concept. We show that the set of equilibria expands as ambiguity aversion increases. The intuition is quite simple: by playing the same strategy in a stationary environment, an agent learns the implied distribution of payoffs, but alternative strategies yield payoffs with unknown distributions; increased aversion to ambiguity makes such strategies less appealing. In sum, a kind of ""status quo bias"" emerges; in the long run, the uncertainty related to tested strategies disappears, but the uncertainty implied by the untested ones does not.</p>"

<p>A model of harassment bribes, paid for services one is entitled to, is developed to analyze the proposal to legalize paying these bribes while increasing fines on accepting them. We explore performance as regards corruption deterrence and public service provision. Costs of verifying reports make the scheme more effective against larger bribes and where institutions' quality is higher. A modified scheme, where immunity is conditional on reporting, addresses some key objections. The mechanism works better against more distortionary forms of corruption than harassment bribes, provided monetary rewards can compensate bribers for losing the object of the corrupt exchange. Results highlight strong complementarities with policies aimed at improving independence and accountability of law enforcers. (JEL D73, K42, O17)</p>"

<p>We examine the roles of the outcome and process dimensions of environmental performance in determining financial performance as measured by Tobin's q. Outcomes refer to the impacts of the firm on the natural environment, while processes are the firm's actions to reduce these outcomes. We focus on a specific outcome - carbon emissions - and suggest that it affects Tobin's q non-linearly. We find that firms achieve the highest financial performance when their carbon performance is neither low nor high, but intermediate. We also find that environmental processes moderate this relationship as they reinforce firms' financial performance through improved stakeholder management. This mixed picture suggests that firms do not generally internalize the costs of poor carbon performance, but those that stand out in both environmental outcomes and processes achieve net financial benefits. These findings are based on a sample of carbon-intensive firms that disclosed their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the Carbon Disclosure Project from 2007 through 2013. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<p>Edoxaban, an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, has been found non-inferior to warfarin for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), with a lower rate of intracranial bleeding. The aim of our investigation was to assess the cost-effectiveness of edoxaban versus warfarin from the perspective of the Italian health-care system. A Markov decision model was used to evaluate lifetime cost and quality-adjusted life expectancy of NVAF patients treated with warfarin or edoxaban. Transition probabilities were obtained from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, cost estimates were based on Italian prices and tariffs, utilities were obtained from the literature. One-way and second-order sensitivity analyses were performed. In the base case, lifetime costs were a,not sign18,658 for edoxaban and a,not sign14,060 for warfarin. Discounted quality-adjusted survival was 9.022 years for edoxaban and 8.425 years for warfarin, leading to an incremental cost-utility ratio of a,not sign7,713 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results were sensitive to time horizon, time in therapeutic range of warfarin and to the relative impact of warfarin versus edoxaban therapy onto quality of life. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed edoxaban to be cost-effective versus warfarin in 92.3 % of the simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of a,not sign25,000 per QALY. In conclusion, edoxaban proved to be a cost-effective alternative to warfarin in patients with moderate-to-high-risk NVAF.</p>"

<p>Drawing on the attention-based view of the firm and the experiential learning literature, this paper develops and tests a theory on how firms learn to cope with the strains of activity load. We first empirically test the impact of activity load on the performance of a focal activity. We then study how this relationship is moderated by four dimensions of experiential learning: stock, homogeneity, pacing, and past success. We test our hypotheses on a proprietary database of 6,913 investments by 248 private equity firms in 77 countries between 1973 and 2008. We find that heavier activity loads exact a smaller toll on performance when firms have larger and more homogeneous stocks of prior experience. However, when firms' prior experience is more rapidly paced or successful, the toll of heavier activity loads on performance grows. Taken together, these four dimensions of experiential learning provide an initial theoretical basis for the development of a capability that we term attention modulation capability.</p>"

<p>This paper is the first attempt to estimate the hydroelectricity rent in Italy, as several concessions are about to expire, and the first to analyze the implications of different redistribution mechanisms. Due to budgetary constraints, local authorities want to capture a higher part of the rent, thought to be considerable. At the same time, the renewal procedure entails the implementation of environmental mitigation measures, as set forth in the water framework directive. Hence, rent-seizing and environmental protection generate a major trade-off. We focus our analysis on the County of Sondrio, home to 18% of the overall hydropower capacity, where the first renewals will take place. We obtain the highest rent ever estimated for hydropower production, averaging from 30.3 (sic)/MWh to 82.4 (sic)/MWh. These high values explain why local authorities are pushing for the introduction of a 30% revenue sharing fee, as they would earn almost 90% of the rent, much more than the 50% currently seized. Albeit satisfying the rent-seizing objective, the proposed fee hinders the implementation of costly mitigation measures. In this paper, we advocate the adoption of a resource rent tax, as we show that it would reduce the trade-off between rent-seizing and environmental protection. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>Mandatory auditor rotation was recently proposed for the European Union and is also under consideration in the United States. There has been little research into either the benefits or costs of rotation in a true mandatory setting that could inform intelligent policy making. Our paper helps fill this gap by examining Italy, where mandatory rotation of auditors has been required since 1975. We find that outgoing auditors do not shirk on effort (or quality), but final-year fees are 7 percent higher than normal, which may indicate opportunistic pricing. The fees of incoming auditors are discounted by 16 percent even though they have abnormally higher engagement hours in the first year (17 percent), which is suggestive of lowballing. However, subsequent fees are abnormally higher and exceed the initial fee discount. Thus, the costs of mandatory rotation are nontrivial. Higher costs could be acceptable if rotation improves audit quality, but we find evidence of the opposite. Namely, the quality of audited earnings is lower in the first three years following rotation, relative to later years of auditor tenure. Since rotation is costly and earnings quality improves with longer auditor tenure, the evidence from Italy does not support the case for mandatory rotation.</p>"

A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods allowed us to link organization-level processes associated with the adoption and implementation of the innovation to its diffusion at the population level. Our findings advance the understanding of how early experiences with the implementation of an innovation influence later adoptions, and they draw attention to how the search for social gains drives some peripheral actors to pioneer an innovation and engage in practices of discursive persuasion and skill reproduction that, in turn, constitute them to be ""exemplary users."" These practices eventually trigger and support the isomorphic diffusion of the innovation, even in the presence of persistent uncertainty about its technical or economic benefits.</p>"

<p>The emergence of innovative and revolutionary Integration Technologies (IntTech) has highly influenced the local government authorities (LGAs) in their decision-making process. LGAs that plan to adopt such IntTech may consider this as a serious investment. Advocates, however, claim that such IntTech have emerged to overcome the integration problems at all levels (e.g. data, object and process). With the emergence of electronic government (e-Government), LGAs have turned to IntTech to fully automate and offer their services on-line and integrate their IT infrastructures. While earlier research on the adoption of IntTech has considered several factors (e.g. pressure, technological, support, and financial), inadequate attention and resources have been applied in systematically investigating the individual, decision and organisational context factors, influencing top management's decisions for adopting IntTech in LGAs. It is a highly considered phenomenon that the success of an organisation's operations relies heavily on understanding an individual's attitudes and behaviours, the surrounding context and the type of decisions taken. Based on empirical evidence gathered through two intensive case studies, this paper attempts to investigate the factors that influence decision makers while adopting IntTech. The findings illustrate two different doctrines one inclined and receptive towards taking risky decisions, the other disinclined. Several underlying rationales can be attributed to such mind-sets in LGAs. The authors aim to contribute to the body of knowledge by exploring the factors influencing top management's decision-making process while adopting IntTech vital for facilitating LGAs' operational reforms.

<p>Background: Health policy makers often have to face decisions on whether and how to incorporate new vaccines into immunisation plans. This study aims to review and catalogue the relevant current frameworks and taxonomies on vaccines and connect these to the DECIDE Evidence to Decision framework (EtD), a general framework based on evidence-based criteria to guide decision-making on intervention adoption.</p>
<p>Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and funding agency websites from 1990 to 2013. We included systematic reviews and primary studies presenting decision-making tools for community vaccine adoption. We qualitatively summarised the reports by purpose, targeted country, principal results, and decisional models. We then extracted and compared the dimensions adopted by vaccine frameworks across studies.</p>
<p>Results: Fourteen studies (five systematic reviews and nine primary studies)were included. Several factors frequently influenced decision-makers' views on vaccines: the most frequent political-context factors considered were Importance of illness or problem, Vaccine characteristics, Resource use, and Feasibility. Others such as Values and preferences and Acceptability were less consistently reported. We did not find evidence on the reasons why a framework for vaccine adoption differs from that for decisions on the adoption of an intervention in general, such as the EtD. There are limited data on how dimensions are explained in practical factors and directly linked to coverage decisions.</p>
<p>Conclusions: This review summarises conceptual models and taxonomy of a heterogeneous and evolving area in health policy decisions. A shared and comprehensive framework on vaccine coverage remains to be achieved with its single dimensions (epidemiologic, effectiveness, economic, and social) valued differently across studies. A generic tool such as the EtD conceptualises all relevant dimensions, and might reduce inconsistencies. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

<p>This article investigates the impact of import competition on firm exit from the manufacturing industries of eight European Union countries. A distinction is made between imports originating from low-cost countries and other imports. While the exit of small firms is high and small firms react strongly to import competition originating from other advanced countries, their exit is not found to be directly affected by imports from low-cost countries. Conversely, the exit rate of larger firms is much smaller in magnitude, but their exit is systematically and positively related to growing imports from low-cost countries. Such empirical evidence is consistent with small and larger firms making up different strategic groups within the same industries, where they face foreign competition of a different nature.</p>"

<p>This article advances our understanding of the effects of monetary rewards on public employee performance and of the contingencies that may moderate these effects. In a randomized control-group experiment with nurses working at a local health authority in Italy, performance-related pay (PRP) had a larger effect on task performance when the rewards were kept secret than when they were disclosed. The negative interaction between PRP and visibility was stronger among participants who were exposed to direct contact with a beneficiary of their efforts, which heightened their perception of making a positive difference in other people's lives. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions that monetary incentives for activities with a prosocial impact may crowd out employee image motivation. There were no crowding-out effects when a symbolic reward was substituted for the monetary incentive.</p>"

We show that goodness of fit, forecasting performance and parameter estimates vary substantially with the frequency bands over which the model is estimated. Estimates obtained using subsets of frequencies are characterized by significantly different parameters, an indication that the model cannot match all frequencies with one set of parameters. In particular, we find that: (i) the low-frequency properties of the data strongly affect parameter estimates obtained in the time domain; (ii) the importance of economic frictions in the model changes when different subsets of frequencies are used in estimation. This is particularly true for the investment adjustment cost and habit persistence: when low frequencies are present in the estimation, the investment adjustment cost and habit persistence are estimated to be higher than when low frequencies are absent.

<p>Subordinates are often seen as impotent, able to react to but not affect how powerholders treat them. Instead, we conceptualize subordinate feedback as an important trigger of powerholders' behavioral self-regulation and explore subordinates' reciprocal influence on how powerholders allocate resources to them over time. In 2 experiments using a multiparty, multiround dictator game paradigm, we found that when subordinates provided candid feedback about whether they found prior allocations to be fair or unfair, powerholders regulated how self-interested their allocations were over time. However, when subordinates provided compliant feedback about powerholders' prior allocation decisions (offered consistently positive feedback, regardless of the powerholders' prior allocation), those powerholders made increasingly self-interested allocations over time. In addition, we showed that guilt partially mediates this relationship: powerholders feel more guilty after receiving negative feedback about an allocation, subsequently leading to a less self-interested allocation, whereas they feel less guilty after receiving positive feedback about an allocation, subsequently taking more for themselves. Our findings integrate the literature on upward feedback with theory about moral self-regulation to support the idea that subordinates are an important source of influence over those who hold power over them.</p>"

To fill this gap, we draw on contracting-out and inter-organizational control literatures to explore the adoption of control mechanisms for public service provision at the municipal level and the variables that can explain their choice. Our results, based on a survey of Italian municipalities, show that in the presence of contracting-out, market-, hierarchy-, and trust-based controls display different intensities, can coexist, and are explained by different variables. Service characteristics are more effective in explaining market-and hierarchy-based controls than relationship characteristics. Trust-based controls are the most widespread, but cannot be explained by the variables traditionally identified in contracting-out and inter-organizational control studies.</p>"

<p>Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella upon first exposure and may reactivate later in life into herpes zoster (HZ), with a risk that is thought to be reduced by re-exposures to VZV. Given the decades-long time scales of reactivation and its dependence on the accumulation of re-exposure episodes, adopting a long-term perspective may be useful to correctly interpret current epidemiological trends of VZV. In this study, we investigate the possible impact of demographic changes on varicella and HZ in Spain, using an age-structured mathematical model informed with historical demographic data and calibrated against age-specific profiles of varicella seroprevalence and HZ incidence data. The model qualitatively reproduces the remarkable growth of HZ incidence observed in Spain between 1997 and 2004, before the introduction of varicella vaccination programmes. We demonstrate that this growth may be partially ascribed to the reduction of varicella circulation that followed the overall decline of the birth rate in the twentieth century. Model predictions further suggest that, even under the most optimistic projections, HZ incidence will continue its rise until at least 2040. Considering the effect of demographic changes can help interpreting variations in epidemiological trends of HZ, contributing to a more accurate evaluation of vaccination programmes against VZV.</p>"

<p>This paper provides new empirical evidence about the impact of various technological policies upon firms' innovative behaviour. We take into consideration the role of policies for innovative activities and we focus on their interaction. While supply-side policies such as R&D subsidies and tax credits have been both extensively discussed in the literature and empirically investigated, the analysis of innovative public procurement is a growing trend in the literature, which still lacks robust empirical evidence. In this paper, we replicate the existing results on supply-side policies, surmise fresh empirical evidence on the outcome of innovative public procurement, and address the issue of possible interaction among the various tools. When controlling for the interaction with other policies, supply-side subsidies cease to be as effective as reported in previous studies and innovative public procurement seems to be more effective than other tools. The preliminary evidence suggests that technology policies exert the highest impact when different policies interact. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Where do innovative products come from? Why do some firms address new market niches and others do not? The literature has rarely blended the concept of innovativeness of a product at the market level with the coherence of the product portfolio at the firm level. In this paper, we examine whether the introduction of products that are highly innovative occurs in firms that are very differentiated, both in terms of target niches and in terms of technological competencies, or rather in firms that focus on specific market segments and that have a limited technological capability. The results show that the introduction of products that are new to the market generally occurs in firms that introduce many products in few market segments and are characterized by a set of specialized technological and market competencies. At least in this industry, the myth of the small specialized niche player does not hold. Implications have a positive relevance to assess firms' behaviour in a given market. From the welfare point of view, this paper helps disentangle monopolistic power generated by truly new products and simple versioning of the product.</p>"

<p>This study examined the role of prospective payment systems in the adoption of newmedical technologies across different countries. A literature review was conducted to provide background for the study and guide development of a survey instrument. The survey was disseminated to hospital payment systems experts in 15 jurisdictions. Fifty-one surveys were disseminated, with 34 returned. The surveys returned covered 14 of the 15 jurisdictions invited to participate. The majority (71%) of countries update the patient classification system and/or payment tariffs on an annual basis to try to account for new technologies. Use of short-term separate or supplementary payments for new technologies occurs in 79% of countries to ensure adequate funding and facilitate adoption. Aminority (43%) of countries use evidence of therapeutic benefit and/or costs to determine or update payment tariffs, although it is somewhat more common in establishing short-term payments. The main barrier to using evidence is uncertain or unavailable clinical evidence. Almost three-fourths of respondents believed diagnosis-related group systems incentivize or deter technology adoption, depending on the particular circumstances. Improvements are needed, such as enhanced strategies for evidence generation and linking evidence of value to payments, national and international collaboration and training to improve existing practice, and flexible timelines for short-term payments. Importantly, additional research is needed to understand how different payment policies impact technology uptake as well as quality of care and costs.</p>"

<p>Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a disease caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense or T. b. rhodesiense. It is transmitted to humans via the tsetse fly. Approximately 70 million people worldwide were at risk of infection in 1995, and approximately 20,000 people across Africa are infected with HAT. The objective of this review was to identify existing economic evaluations in order to summarise cost-effective interventions to reduce, control, or eliminate the burden of HAT. The studies included in the review were compared and critically appraised in order to determine if there were existing standardised methods that could be used for economic evaluation of HAT interventions or if innovative methodological approaches are warranted. A search strategy was developed using keywords and was implemented in January 2014 in several databases. The search returned a total of 2,283 articles. After two levels of screening, a total of seven economic evaluations were included and underwent critical appraisal using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Methodology Checklist 6: Economic Evaluations. Results from the existing studies focused on the cost-effectiveness of interventions for the control and reduction of disease transmission. Modelling was a common method to forecast long-term results, and publications focused on interventions by category, such as case detection, diagnostics, drug treatments, and vector control. Most interventions were considered cost-effective based on the thresholds described; however, the current treatment, nifurto-mix-eflornithine combination therapy (NECT), has not been evaluated for cost-effectiveness, and considerations for cost-effective strategies for elimination have yet to be completed. Overall, the current evidence highlights the main components that play a role in control; however, economic evaluations of HAT elimination strategies are needed to assist national decision makers, stakeholders, and key funders. These analyses would be of use, as HAT is currently being prioritized as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) to reach elimination by 2020.</p>"

<p>There is evidence that age matters in politics. In this article we study whether implementation of affirmative action policies on gender can generate additional effects on an alternative dimension of representation, namely, the age of politicians. We consider an Italian law which introduced gender quotas in candidate lists for local elections in 1993, and was abolished in 1995. As not all municipalities went through elections during this period, we can identify two groups of municipalities and use a difference in differences estimation to analyze the effect of gender quotas on the age of elected politicians. We find that gender quotas are associated with election of politicians that are younger by more than 1 year. The effect occurs mainly due to the reduction in age of elected male politicians and is consistent with the optimizing behavior of parties or of voters. (JEL codes: D72, J45).</p>"

<p>This special issue aims at advancing the debate about the interpretative power of evolutionary perspectives on economic development and institutional change. In the introduction, we argue that the interpretative power of the current evolutionary approach can be improved by elaborating an augmented' perspective to economic development, which explicitly integrates the role of institutions and the dynamics of natural resource sectors (e.g. agro-food) into the analysis. We maintain that such a theoretical and empirical advancement can help to define a conceptual framework that is more suitable to analyse innovation-driven change, differentiated development patterns, opportunities and constraints for developing countries in the globalised knowledge economy. A collection of papers that adopt this perspective are discussed in order to prove the interpretative power of this approach in a variety of development contexts.</p>"

In the case of tacit knowledge flows it shows that intellectual property rights (IPRs) reinforcement has no effect and that sharing a common legal origin and technological proximity are more important than geographical distance.

We test a gravity model that accounts for geographical, cultural, commercial, technological, structural and institutional differences among a group of old world (OW) and new world (NW) producers and consumers. Our findings confirm the problems imposed by geographical and technological distance on international research collaboration. Furthermore, they show that similarity in trade patterns has a positive impact on international scientific collaboration.

<p>We build on the existing literature in public-private partnerships (PPP) to analyze the main incentive issues in PPPs and the shape of optimal contracts in those contexts. We present a basic model of procurement in a multitask environment in which a risk-averse firm chooses noncontractible efforts in cost reduction and quality improvement. We first consider the effect on incentives and risk transfer of bundling building and management stages into a single contract, allowing for different assumptions on feasible contracts and information available to the government. Then we extend the model in novel directions. We study the relationship between the operator and its financiers and the impact of private finance. We discuss the trade-off between incentive and flexibility in PPP agreements and the dynamics of PPPs, including cost overruns. We also consider how institutions, and specifically the risk of regulatory opportunism, affect contract design and incentives. The conclusion summarizes policy implications on the desirability of PPPs.</p>"

<p>We establish a theoretical and empirical framework to assess the role of resource endowments and their geographic location in interstate conflict. The main predictions of the theory are that conflict is more likely when at least one country has natural resources, when the resources in the resource-endowed country are closer to the border, and, in the case where both countries have natural resources, when the resources are located asymmetrically vis-A -vis the border. We test these predictions on a novel data set featuring oilfield distances from bilateral borders. The empirical analysis shows that the presence and location of oil are significant and quantitatively important predictors of interstate conflicts after World War II.

In particular, welfare ratios present more economically relevant information on living standards than the commodity wages that Dobado prefers (Dobado Gonzalez and Garcia Montero 2014). We argue that Dobado fails to offer convincing evidence against our findings; hence, we stand by these results, which suggest that the divergence between North and Latin America began early in the colonial period.</p>"

<p>In the last decade, design innovation has gained increasing prominence in the marketplace, with a growing number of firms innovating not only through technology but also through novel product forms (i.e., design). However, while the effect of technological innovation on product sales is a heavily studied topic, a defining theory of how design innovation influences product sales is still missing. This paper provides demand-and supply-side theories to formulate a set of coherent hypotheses about the effect of design innovativeness, i.e., the degree of novelty in a product's design, on sales' evolution over time. The hypotheses are tested in two different samples. In the first, car models introduced in the United States from 1978 to 2006 (for a total of 2,757 model-year data) are analyzed. In the second, motorcycle models introduced in the United States from 1980 to 2008 (for a total of 2,847 model-year observations) are analyzed. I find that design innovativeness diminishes initial sales' status but increases sales' growth rates. Furthermore, design and technological innovativeness have a negative interaction effect on sales' initial status, but a positive effect on sales' growth rates. Finally, brand strength and brand advertising expenditures worsen the negative effect of design innovativeness on initial sales' status, but boost its positive effect on sales' growth rates.</p>"

<p>Background: Authorship and inventorship are the key attribution rights that contribute to a scientist's reputation and professional achievement. This article discusses the concepts of coinventorship and coauthorship in the legal and sociological literature, as well as journals' publication guidelines and technology transfer offices' recommendations. It discusses also the relative importance of social and legal norms in the allocation of scientific credit.</p>
<p>Method: This article revises critically the literature on inventorship and authorship in academic science and derives some policy implications on the institutional mechanisms allocating scientific credit. It reports and assesses the recent empirical evidence on the importance of social norms for the attribution of inventorship and authorship in teams of scientists. Finally, it discusses those norms from a social welfare perspective.</p>
<p>Result: The social norms that regulate the distribution of authorship and inventorship do not reflect exclusively the relative contribution of each team member but also the members' relative seniority or status. In the case of inventorship, such social norms appear to be as important as the legal norms whose respect is often invoked by technology transfer officers.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Authorship and inventorship appear to be obsolete because they do not capture the increasing division of labor and responsibility typical of contemporary scientific research teams. The informative value of both authorship and inventorship attributions may be much more limited than assumed by recent evaluation exercises.</p>"

<p>Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract disease and related hospitalization of young children in least developed countries. Individuals are repeatedly infected, but it is the first exposure, often in early infancy, that results in the vast majority of severe RSV disease. Unfortunately, due to immunological immaturity, infants are a problematic RSV vaccine target. Several trials are ongoing to identify a suitable candidate vaccine and target group, but no immunization program is yet in place.</p>
<p>Methods: In this work, an individual-based model that explicitly accounts for the socio-demographic population structure is developed to investigate RSV transmission patterns in a rural setting of Kenya and to evaluate the potential effectiveness of alternative population targets in reducing RSV infant infection.</p>
<p>Results: We find that household transmission is responsible for 39% of infant infections and that school-age children are the main source of infection within the household, causing around 55% of cases. Moreover, assuming a vaccine-induced protection equivalent to that of natural infection, our results show that annual vaccination of students is the only alternative strategy to routine immunization of infants able to trigger a relevant and persistent reduction of infant infection (on average, of 35.6% versus 41.5% in 10 years of vaccination). Interestingly, if vaccination of pregnant women boosts maternal antibody protection in infants by an additional 4 months, RSV infant infection will be reduced by 31.5%.</p>
<p>Conclusions: These preliminary evaluations support the efforts to develop vaccines and related strategies that go beyond targeting vaccines to those at highest risk of severe disease.</p>"

<p>The theoretical development and empirical testing of the effects of humility in the organizational sciences is surprisingly rare. This is especially pronounced in the study of leadership in Asian contexts. To address this we employ a qualitative approach to examine the conceptualization of leader humility in Singapore and assess whether this conceptualization differs from other emerging conceptualizations of leader humility. In Study I, using semi-structured interviews of 25 Singaporeans, we identified nine major dimensions of humble leader behaviors and explored our participants' beliefs about culturally-based differences in leader humility. In Study 2 (N = 307), we generalized our findings to a broader sample and explored how the nine dimensions fit with existing taxonomies. In addition to replicating all of the Western conceptual dimensions of humility, we identified five unique dimensions of behaviors indicative of leader humility in Singapore. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We identify six different supervisory cultures and observe to what extent the words used in public speeches by the deans of the national supervision authority reflect the national cultural values of the Hofstede framework (Hofstede et al., 2010). By analyzing a panel of banks operating in the EU-15 from 1999 and 2011, our paper provides empirical evidence that supervisory culture influences the stability of banks.

<p>In this paper we standardize, compare, and aggregate results from thirteen surveys of technology experts, performed over a period of five years using a range of different methodologies, but all aiming at eliciting expert judgment on the future cost of five key energy technologies and how future costs might be influenced by public R&D investments. To enable researchers and policy makers to use the wealth of collective knowledge obtained through these expert elicitations we develop and present a set of assumptions to harmonize them. We also aggregate expert estimates within each study and across studies to facilitate the comparison. The analysis showed that, as expected, technology costs are expected to go down by 2030 with increasing levels of R&D investments, but that there is not a high level of agreement between individual experts or between studies regarding the technology areas that would benefit the most from R&D investments. This indicates that further study of prospective cost data may be useful to further inform R&D investments. We also found that the contributions of additional studies to the variance of costs in one technology area differed by technology area, suggesting that (barring new information about the downsides of particular forms of elicitations) there may be value in not only including a diverse and relatively large group of experts, but also in using different methods to collect estimates.

<p>In the present paper we use the output of multiple expert elicitation surveys on the future cost of key low-carbon technologies and use it as input of three Integrated Assessment models, GCAM, MARKAL_US and WITCH. By means of a large set of simulations we aim to assess the implications of these subjective distributions of technological costs over key model outputs. We are able to detect what sources of technology uncertainty are more influential, how this differs across models, and whether and how results are affected by the time horizon, the metric considered or the stringency of the climate policy. In unconstrained emission scenarios, within the range of future technology performances considered in the present analysis, the cost of nuclear energy is shown to dominate all others in affecting future emissions. Climate-constrained scenarios, stress the relevance, in addition to that of nuclear energy, of biofuels, as they represent the main source of decarbonization of the transportation sector and bioenergy, since the latter can be coupled with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to produce negative emissions.

<p>This paper reports a new test of intransitive choice using individual measurements of regret-and similarity-based intransitive models of choice under uncertainty. Our test is tailor-made and uses subject-specific stimuli. Despite these features, we observed only a few intransitivities. A possible explanation for the poor predictive performance of intransitive choice models is that they only allow for interactions between acts. They exclude within-act interactions by retaining the assumption that preferences are separable over states of nature. Prospect theory, which relaxes separability but retains transitivity, predicted choices better.

<p>Private health care expenditure ranges from 15% to 30% of total healthcare spending in OECD countries. The literature suggests that there should be an inverse correlation between quality of public services and private expenditures. The main objective of this study is to explore the association between quality of public healthcare and private expenditures in the Italian Regional Healthcare Systems (RHSs). The institutional framework offered by the Italian NHS allows to investigate on the differences among the regions while controlling for institutional factors. The study uses micro-data from the ISTAT Household Consumption Survey (HCS) and a rich set of regional quality indicators. The results indicate that there is a positive and significant correlation between quality and private spending per capita across regions. The study also points out the strong association between the distribution of private consumption and income. In order to account for the influence of income, the study segmented data in three socio-economic classes and computed cross-regional correlations of RHSs quality and household healthcare expenditure per capita, within each class. No correlation was found between the two variables. These findings are quite surprising and call into question the theory that better quality of public services crowds out private spending, or, at the very least, it undermines the simplistic notions that higher levels of private spending are a direct consequence of poor quality in the public sector. This suggests that policies should avoid to simplistically link private spending with judgements or assessments about the functioning or efficacy of the public system and its organizations.

<p>This article examines the role of technology in the selection of targets in a merger. Held technology should have a notable impact, especially in contexts in which specific know-how resides with experts as well as within organizational routines that are difficult to reproduce. By acquiring a target, firms obtain novel technologies, along with the knowledge and capabilities necessary to implement them. Such acquisitions become more relevant as the complexity of the technologies increases. With a focus on the US hospital market-in which technology is a relevant factor and complexity has been growing-the hypotheses tests use data from 222 mergers and acquisitions that took place between 1985 and 2000. The results confirm that technology is a fundamental driver of the US hospital consolidation process: hospitals prefer targets that hold a different set of technologies from their own, especially when those technologies are complex and involve some know-how that is difficult to replicate.</p>"

All subjects participated in a series of economic tasks administered in the same sequence across treatments. After controlling for both the willingness to pay for an object and the potential misperception of probabilities as elicited in the experiment, we detect no effect of alcohol in depleting subjects' risk tolerance.

<p>The effect of a targeted agent on a cancer patient's clinical outcome putatively is mediated through the agent's effect on one or more early biological events. This is motivated by pre-clinical experiments with cells or animals that identify such events, represented by binary or quantitative biomarkers. When evaluating targeted agents in humans, central questions are whether the distribution of a targeted biomarker changes following treatment, the nature and magnitude of this change, and whether it is associated with clinical outcome. Major difficulties in estimating these effects are that a biomarker's distribution may be complex, vary substantially between patients, and have complicated relationships with clinical outcomes. We present a probabilistically coherent framework for modeling and estimation in this setting, including a hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric mixture model for biomarkers that we use to define a functional profile of pre-versus-post-treatment biomarker distribution change. The functional is similar to the receiver operating characteristic used in diagnostic testing. The hierarchical model yields clusters of individual patient biomarker profile functionals, and we use the profile as a covariate in a regression model for clinical outcome. The methodology is illustrated by analysis of a dataset from a clinical trial in prostate cancer using imatinib to target platelet-derived growth factor, with the clinical aim to improve progression-free survival time.</p>"

<p>Many violations of the independence axiom of expected utility can be traced to subjects' attraction to risk-free prospects. The key axiom in this paper, negative certainty independence ([Dillenberger, 2010]), formalizes this tendency. Our main result is a utility representation of all preferences over monetary lotteries that satisfy negative certainty independence together with basic rationality postulates. Such preferences can be represented as if the agent were unsure of how to evaluate a given lottery p; instead, she has in mind a set of possible utility functions over outcomes and displays a cautious behavior: she computes the certainty equivalent of p with respect to each possible function in the set and picks the smallest one. The set of utilities is unique in a well defined sense. We show that our representation can also be derived from a cautious completion of an incomplete preference relation.</p>"

<p>Research was largely consistent in predicting a negative relationship between family ownership and research and development (R&D) intensity until Chrisman and Patel, using a behavioral agency model (BAM), called this general assumption into question. They argued that publicly owned family firms typically invest less in R&D than nonfamily-owned firms. This behavior may however be reversed if economic performance levels are below family aspirations or if family long-term goals, such as pursuing strong transgenerational family control, are highly valued. While most researchers, like Chrisman and Patel, primarily focused on large listed firms, more research on the relationship between family ownership and R&D intensity in privately held small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is required. This is because firm size can play an important role in understanding the innovation management behavior of firms. Building on the BAM perspective, in the present paper it is argued that Chrisman and Patel's results can be extended to the context of SMEs, albeit with one important specification: the relationship between family ownership and R&D intensity is likely to be contingent on the way the family has invested its wealth. Specifically, it is contended that in the context of SMEs, where goals are more fluid and mixed, when there is a high overlap between family wealth and firm equity (i.e., most of the family's wealth is invested in the firm) the relationship between family ownership and R&D intensity is negative because of the family owners' greater desire to protect their socioemotional wealth (SEW). However, if the overlap between the family's total wealth and single firm equity is low (i.e., firm equity is just a small part of the total family wealth), the relationship between family ownership and R&D intensity is positive as the low overlap between family wealth and firm equity reduces the family's loss aversion propensity. In such a situation, family ownership is likely to foster R&D intensity because of the long-term orientation of family owners that increases the family firm's propensity to bear the risk of investing in R&D activities. The hypothesis is tested and confirmed in a study of 240 small- and medium-sized firms based in Italy. The paper contributes to the literature in several ways. First, adding to the literature on innovation management and R&D intensity, it increases the understanding of what drives or inhibits R&D investments in SMEs when a family is involved in the ownership of the firm. This is particularly important because research on innovation management, as well as research on R&D intensity in family firms, is primarily focused on large firms and much less on SMEs. Second, the study complements arguments from prior research on the correlates of R&D intensity in large listed firms, showing that the BAM and SEW perspective offer a theoretical framework that is also able to illustrate the complex nature of innovation management i"

<p>The article analyzes the diffusion of childbearing within cohabitation in Norway, using municipality data over a 24-year period (1988-2011). Research has found substantial spatial heterogeneity in this phenomenon but also substantial spatial correlation, and the prevalence of childbearing within cohabitation has increased significantly over time. We consider several theoretical perspectives and implement a spatial panel model that allows accounting for autocorrelation not only on the dependent variable but also on key explanatory variables, and hence identifies the key determinants of diffusion of childbearing within cohabitation across space and over time. We find only partial support for the second demographic transition as a theory able to explain the diffusion of childbearing within cohabitation. Our results show that at least in the first phase of the diffusion (1988-1997), economic difficulties as measured by increased unemployment among men contributed to the diffusion of childbearing within cohabitation. However, the most important driver for childbearing within cohabitation is expansion in education for women.</p>"

<p>Background: The mechanisms through which the relationships among public institutions, private providers and families affect care and service provision systems are puzzling. How can we understand the mechanisms in these contexts? Which elements should we explore to capture the complexity of care provision? The aim of our study is to provide a framework that can help read and reframe these puzzling care provision mechanisms in a welfare mix context.</p>
<p>Methods: First, we develop a theoretical framework for understanding how service provision occurs in care systems that are characterised by a variety of relationships between multiple actors, using an evidence-based approach that looks at both public and private expenditures and the number of users relative to the level of needs coverage and compared with declared values and political rhetoric. Second, we test this framework in two case studies built on data from two prominent Italian regions, Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna. We argue that service provision models depend on the interplay among six conceptual elements: policy values, governance rules, resources, nature of the providers, service standards and eligibility criteria.</p>
<p>Results: Our empirical study shows that beneath the relevant differences in values and political rhetoric between the case studies of the two Italian regions, there is a surprising isomorphism in service standards and the levels of covering the population's needs.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The suggested framework appears to be effective and feasible; it fosters interdisciplinary approaches and supports policy-making discussions. This study may contribute to deepening knowledge about public care service provision and institutional arrangements, which can be used to promote more effective reforms and may advance future research. Although the framework was tested on the Italian welfare system, it can be used to assess many different systems.</p>"

<p>Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to more thoroughly investigate the role of organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) in sales force settings and the reason why salespeople should practice OCBs. In fact, in spite of the huge body of literature on OCBs and their impact on performance, some important knowledge gaps still remain to be filled. Inconsistent and unexpected findings are particularly apparent in the relatively few studies investigating OCBs in sales forces. The authors argue that some specific characteristics of the selling job and related tasks make the analysis of the practice of these behaviors in the sales context particularly interesting.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - The authors explore which OCBs salespeople engage in, and analyze the perceived consequences of such behaviors using means-end theory and the laddering technique. They apply means-end theory and the laddering technique to interview a sample of salespersons from three companies operating in different business-to-business settings.</p>
<p>Findings - The end result of the empirical analysis is the hierarchical value map showing a set of linkages among OCBs and their perceived consequences. In the perceptions of salespeople, OCBs play a strong utilitarian role in that they facilitate personal goal attainment. In salespeople's minds, there are no relevant trade-offs between OCBs and task-performance as long as the former can be used to improve the latter. For salespeople, the path from OCBs to performance may vary, depending on whether the performance in question is organizational, individual or customer-focused. Finally, some OCBs apparently contribute to creating customer trust in the salesperson.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - The findings add some interesting insights to the discussion regarding some controversies in OCBs literature, especially the interplay of contextual performance and task performance.</p>
<p>Practical implications - Various types of OCBs can be encouraged through different managerial interventions. As an example, altruism can be fostered by appropriate recruiting criteria (e.g. using ""attitude toward teamwork"" as a key personnel selection factor), and by training initiatives and leadership style. Altruism can also be stimulated by an adequately designed organizational structure (e.g. team-based) as well as by adopting appropriate integration mechanisms that facilitate interpersonal and interfunctional cooperation. Sales managers can foster some OCBs by promoting knowledge sharing and reciprocal learning among members of the sales team, and by emphasizing the positive consequences of OCBs in all communication with salespeople.</p>
<p>Originality/value - Findings from this study challenge some widespread assumptions about OCBs in general. In fact, most of the literature holds that OCBs are an example of prosocial behaviors. Actually, the findings suggest that in the specific case of salespeople, OCBs are ultimately self-"

<p>This paper introduces a novel methodology for analyzing bargaining games on network markets, which are markets where transactions occur by means of distribution networks (e.g., gas, electric energy, water, etc.). The overall economic surplus obtained in the market is distributed among all network agents the on the basis of their bargaining power, which in turn depends on a variety of factors: position of each agent (e.g., a country) in the network, reliability in the cooperation scheme (e.g., geo-political stability), existence of market distortions and availability of outside options (e.g., alternative energy sources). The method we propose, which is illustrated here through an application to a fictitious network structure, is based on a two-stage process: first, a network optimization model is used to generate payoff values under different coalitions and network structures; second, cooperative game solutions are identified. Any change in the network structure entails both a variation in the overall welfare level and in the distribution of surplus among agents, as it affects their relative bargaining power. Therefore, expected costs and benefits, at the aggregate as well as at the individual level, can be compared to assess the economic viability of any investment in network infrastructure. A number of model variants and extensions are also considered: changing demand, exogenous instability factors, market distortions, externalities and outside options.</p>"

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>In January 2013 a novel type of multicomponent protein-based vaccine against group B meningococcal disease was licensed by the European Medicines Agency. With the widespread use of the meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccines, serogroup B remains now the major cause of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia in young children in Europe. The aim of this study is to investigate the health and the economic outcomes of MenB vaccine introduction into the Italian routine mass vaccination programme.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>The present work is structured in two main parts. Firstly, we assess the epidemiological burden of group B meningococcal disease using official hospitalisation and notification data from two of the most populated Italian regions (Lombardia and Piemonte) during a 6-year study period (2007-2012). Secondly, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the immunisation programme in Italy from the public health payer perspective under base case parameters assumptions and performing a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness and the uncertainty of our model results.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>MenB serotype is responsible for 59% of the 341 cases of Invasive Meningococcal Disease in Lombardia and Piemonte. Incidence rate for MenB infection is estimated to be 0.21/100,000/y resulting at the highest level in children <= 4 years of age. Although the new MenB vaccine can potentially prevent about one third of the disease cases in the Italian population, model results show this strategy is unlikely to be cost-effective (ICER value over (sic)350,000/QALY) with a vaccine that prevents disease only. These results are robust under most of the sensitivity scenarios except when allowing for lower discount rates.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>The introduction of the novel vaccine into the routine immunisation schedule needs to be carefully evaluated. The new MenB vaccine has the potential to reduce the disease burden at the population level. However, from the Italian Health Service perspective, the immunisation programme is unlikely to be cost-effective at the current incidence levels and vaccine price.</p>"

<p>This article, by using both a qualitative and quantitative approach, focuses on large business groups (BGs) in Italy. It provides a methodology of analysis which aims at re-constructing the boundaries and the relevance of BGs in a national economy in the long-run, identifying a country-specific taxonomy of both their forms and the rationales (logics) for their existence. By adopting an original methodology, that is the network analysis, and by using a large and comprehensive dataset (Imita.db), this article also provides some proxy measures of the relevance of the largest BGs in the Italian economy, something which has never been done before in Italian business history research. The analysis clearly shows the persistence of large and entangled BGs in the Italian economy. It confirms that this particular form of business organisation is neither limited to the less developed countries, nor is simply a second best functional substitute of the multi-divisional form diffused in the liberal market economies. Finally, this article also suggests a research itinerary which can also be fruitfully applied in business history to other specific cases.</p>"

<p>Most companies struggle in the effort to become more customer-centric. A typical example of customer-centric change initiative is adoption of a key account management (KAM) program. Companies are increasingly adopting such programs, but knowledge of how to successfully manage the organizational change required to implement them is extremely limited. Our goal in this study was to use case study methodology in order to develop a comprehensive understanding of organizational issues that firms need to consider when implementing a KAM program. We accordingly describe, using as our observational lens a well-established framework (the 7S model), how a multinational company adopted a KAM program in a local branch. We argue, on the basis of our review of the literature on RAM adoption and on change management in sales organizations, that the 7S model can be used to meaningfully synthesize both processes. Using the 7S model, we describe and interpret the change management project the company followed in order to implement the RAM program.

<p>The 2014 decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the case Grande Stevens and Others v. Italy raises numerous complex issues concerning the regulation of market abuse in Italy and Europe, as well as in other systems. The broad questions that the Strasbourg Court addresses, specifically concerning the nature of administrative sanctions and civil penalties, due process in administrative sanctioning procedures, and double jeopardy issues when both criminal and civil sanctions can be imposed, not only are extremely practically relevant for the current and future regulation of insider trading and market manipulation, but also open a more theoretical discussion on the relationships between the only apparently unrelated fields of human rights and enforcement in financial markets. This article offers an analysis of the decision, also in the light of future developments due to the recent reform of European law on market abuse, and compares this landmark European decision with corresponding US case law.</p>"

<p>Following calls to capture the consequences of family involvement in the business, this article empirically investigates the mediating role of board processes (i.e., effort norms, use of knowledge and skills, and cognitive conflicts) and board (control and strategy) tasks in the relationship between family involvement and firm performance in small and medium-sized companies. To address this purpose, we developed a theoretical model using family business and corporate governance literature. We collected data from one sample of small and medium-sized enterprises, and we applied structural equation modeling to validate and test constructs and relationships. Our results show that (a) family involvement in the business has a positive impact on effort norms and use of knowledge and skills, and a negative one on cognitive conflicts, (b) board processes have generally a positive influence on board tasks performance, and (c) board strategy task performance positively influences firm financial performance, while board control tasks do not have a significant impact.

Furthermore, such a distribution satisfies the requirements to be considered a confidence distribution. Many examples are provided for models, which, although very simple, are widely used in applications. A characterization of the families for which the fiducial distribution coincides with a Bayesian posterior is given, and the strict connection with Jeffreys prior is shown. Asymptotic expansions of fiducial distributions are obtained without any further assumptions, and again, the relationship with the objective Bayesian analysis is pointed out. Finally, using the Edgeworth expansions, we compare the coverage of the fiducial intervals with that of other common intervals, proving the good behaviour of the former.</p>"

<p>Previous studies in the financial economics literature highlight the value of non-financial information in Internet and telephony stocks (Amir and Lev 1996; Trueman, Wong, and Zhang 2001). Other studies consider the financial and share price performance implications of assurance of non-financial information such as ISO 9000 certification (Corbett, Montes-Sancho, and Kirsch 2005), Total Quality Management awards (Hendricks and Singhal 1997), and non-financial information disclosure (Coram, Monroe, and Woodliff 2009). However, prior studies have occurred in settings where disclosure and assurance of non-financial information is voluntary. We provide evidence on the value of assurance of non-financial information where the assurance of public resource disclosures made under the JORC Code by Australian Mining Development Stage Entities are mandatory. The assurance role undertaken by Competent Persons reporting under the JORC Code bears many close similarities to the financial reporting assurance role undertaken by auditors. Further, the information environment of MDSEs is characterized by high information asymmetry and the reality that the utility of non-financial technical information supersedes financial statement information in firm valuation. We document very weak evidence of greater abnormal returns evident when reserve disclosures are provided by specialist mining consultants. In supplementary analysis, we test for implications of switching mineral consultant and find that clients experience significant positive abnormal returns when the successor is larger. Overall, our findings support the insurance hypothesis, in that mandatory specialist assurance matters little where litigation risk is low.</p>"

It is argued that the relative importance of direct external linkages and external relations mediated by gatekeepers varies according to specific local conditions. It is found that direct external relations, on average, contribute to broadening and rejuvenating the local knowledge base and outperform external links mediated by gatekeepers; the latter, however, are especially important in cities with a localized and specialized knowledge base, as they enable the trans-coding and absorption at the local level of externally sourced knowledge.</p>"

<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>It is increasingly acknowledged that not only gender equality but also gender ideology plays a role in explaining fertility in advanced societies. In a micro perspective, the potential mismatch between gender equality (i.e., the actual sharing taking place in a couple) and gender ideology (i.e., attitudes and beliefs regarding gender roles) may drive childbearing decisions.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>This paper assesses the impact of consistency between gender equality in attitudes and equality in the division of household labour on the likelihood of having another child, for different parities.</p>
<p>METHODS</p>
<p>Relying on two-wave panel data of the Bulgarian, Czech, French, Hungarian, and Lithuanian Generations and Gender Surveys, we build a couple typology defined by gender attitudes and housework-sharing. The typology identifies four types of couple: 1) gender-unequal attitudes and gender-unequal housework-sharing; 2) gender-equal attitudes and gender-unequal housework-sharing; 3) gender-unequal attitudes and gender-equal housework-sharing; 4) gender-equal attitudes and gender-equal housework-sharing. The couple types enter into a logistic regression model on childbirth.</p>
<p>RESULTS</p>
<p>The impact of the typology varies with parity and gender: taking as reference category the case of gender-equal attitudes and gender-equal division of housework, the effect of all the other couple types on a new childbirth is strong and negative for the second child and female respondents.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
<p>The consistency between gender ideology and actual partners' housework-sharing is only favourable for childbearing as long as there is gender equality in both the dimensions.</p>"

<p>In selecting the preferred course of action, decision makers are often uncertain about one or more probabilities of interest. The experimental literature has ascertained that this uncertainty (ambiguity) might affect decision makers' preferences. Then, the decision maker might wish to incorporate ambiguity aversion in the analysis. We investigate the modeling ambiguity attitudes in the solution of decision analysis problems through functionals well-established in the decision theory literature. We obtain the multiple-event problems for subjective expected utility, smooth ambiguity and maximin decision makers. This allows us to establish the conditions under which these alternative decision makers face equivalent problems. Results for certainty equivalents and risk premia in the presence of both risk and ambiguity aversion are obtained. A recent generalization of the classical Arrow-Pratt quadratic approximation allows us to quantify the portions of a premium due to risk- and to ambiguity-aversion. The numerical implementation of the objective functions is addressed, showing that all functionals can be estimated at no additional burden through Monte Carlo simulation. The well known Carter Racing case study is addressed quantitatively to demonstrate the findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

Technical change and new product proliferation have made this industry extremely dynamic, even if market shares are highly concentrated in the hands of very few companies.

In particular, it studies the evolution in hardware components relying upon an original dataset of product characteristics including all smartphones launched in the market between 2004 and 2013. Results show that, despite some convergence in the introduction of vertical innovations, product differentiation still characterizes the competition among manufacturers and a dominant design has not yet emerged.

<p>An emerging topic in environmental management studies is the role of eco-labels in guiding consumers in their purchasing choices. In order to contribute to the current debate on this topic, this research paper aims to assess, through a quantitative analysis, whether the knowledge, awareness and information that consumers gather on the environmental impact of a product through an eco-label can stimulate an eco-friendly behavior. Moreover, we assess whether general attitudes in purchasing behaviors determine a personal attitude toward ecological consumption. The findings from this study, which is based on a large dataset of Italian consumers, highlight a significant role of eco-labels in increasing the consumer's perceived behavioral control, unlike loyalty in brand and in store, which do not exert a significant influence.

<p>Consumers often touch products, and such haptic exploration can improve consumers' evaluations of the product. We tested whether cross-modal priming might contribute to this effect. Under the guise of a weight judgment task, which served as a haptic prime, we had blindfolded participants grasp familiar products (e.g., a Coca Cola bottle). We then had participants visually identify the brand name as quickly as possible (Experiments 1 and 2), list the first beverage brands that come to mind (Experiment 3), or choose between beverage brands as reward for participation (Experiment 4). Haptic exposure facilitated visual recognition of the given brand and increased participants' consideration and choice of that brand. Moreover, this haptic priming was brand specific and occurred even among participants who did not consciously identify the prime brand. These results demonstrate that haptic brand identities can facilitate recognition, consideration, and brand choice, regardless of consumers' conscious awareness of this haptic priming.

Option exercise is optimally postponed not only when moneyness is insufficient, but also when it is excessive. We extend the classical optimal exercise properties for American options. Early exercise of an American call with a negative underlying payout rate can occur if the option is moderately in the money. We fully characterize the existence, the monotonicity, the continuity, the limits, and the asymptotic behavior at maturity of the double free boundary that separates the exercise region from the double continuation region. We find that the finite-maturity nonstandard policy conspicuously differs from the infinite-maturity one.</p>"

<p>The basic reproduction number R-0 and the effective reproduction number R are pivotal parameters in infectious disease epidemiology, quantifying the transmission potential of an infection in a population. We estimate both parameters from 13 pre-vaccination serological data sets on varicella zoster virus (VZV) in 12 European countries and from population-based social contact surveys under the commonly made assumptions of endemic and demographic equilibrium. The fit to the serology is evaluated using the inferred effective reproduction number R as a model eligibility criterion combined with AIC as a model selection criterion. For only 2 out of 12 countries, the common choice of a constant proportionality factor is sufficient to provide a good fit to the seroprevalence data. For the other countries, an age-specific proportionality factor provides a better fit, assuming physical contacts lasting longer than 15 min area good proxy for potential varicella transmission events. In all countries, primary infection with VZV most often occurs in early childhood, but there is substantial variation in transmission potential with R-0 ranging from 2.8 in England and Wales to 7.6 in The Netherlands. Two non-parametric methods, the maximal information coefficient (MIC) and a random forest approach, are used to explain these differences in R-0 in terms of relevant country-specific characteristics. Our results suggest an association with three general factors: inequality in wealth, infant vaccination coverage and child care attendance. This illustrates the need to consider fundamental differences between European countries when formulating and parameterizing infectious disease models. (C) 2015 The Authors.

<p>This paper investigates service modularity and inter-organizational coupling in knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS). While KIBS literature traditionally emphasizes tight client-provider interactions with service customization, modularity literature emphasizes inter-organizational decoupling with service standardization. We disentangle this tension by exploring how KIBS firms utilize service modularity and shape their client-provider relationships in terms of information and knowledge sharing. Conducting two in-depth case studies of third-party logistics (TPLs), we show that TPLs extensively rely on service modularity with standard procedures as their constitutive element. We also demonstrate that service modularity and inter-organizational decoupling are aligned for knowledge sharing but not for information sharing, which remains high regardless of the service architecture. Overall, we suggest that modularity in KIBS differs in many aspects from modularity in products and that these differences significantly impact the organizational design consequences of service modularity. Theoretical and managerial implications are drawn.</p>"

<p>Unified growth theory suggests the fertility decline was crucial for achieving long-term growth, yet the causes behind that decline are still not entirely clear from an empirical point of view. In particular for France, the first country to experience this demographic transition in the European context, the reasons why some areas of the country had lower fertility than others are poorly understood. Using d,partement level data for the last quarter of the nineteenth century, this paper exploits the French regional variation to study the correlates of fertility, estimating various fixed-effects models. The findings confirm the importance of some of the forces suggested by standard fertility choice models. Education in general, female education in particular, for example, seems to be crucial. Results also highlight the relevance of non-economic factors (such as secularisation), for which I provide new measurements. The presence of spatial dependence also suggests that diffusion of fertility played a particular role.</p>"

<p>In addressing integration issues, service-oriented architecture (SOA) has emerged and been adopted by banks, but many of them have failed to achieve significant SOA benefits. An important reason for this failure is attributed to the absence of a methodological framework that explains factors influencing SOA adoption in e-banking. In addition to this, the normative literature reports that differences may exist between organizations from developed and transition economies when they adopt integration technologies. Thus, the aim of this paper is to (a) propose a methodological framework for SOA adoption, (b) test it through case studies conducted in a developed and a transition economy, and (c) investigate differences and similarities among these two types of economies. The findings verify our framework and suggest some additions to it as there are new factors that were observed during the case studies like SOA governance. Our study also reveals similarities and differences, like the level of attention between case organizations from a developed and transition economy. This paper extends the body of knowledge and allows us to better understand the adoption practices of the organizations from developed and transition economies. The paper also provides new insights related to factors affecting SOA adoption in e-banking.</p>"

<p>Conclusion: These findings provide information about biomarker enrichment and outcome measurements that could be employed to reduce MCI patient samples and treatment duration in future clinical trials.</p>"

<p>The concept of virtual water refers to the volume of water used in the production of a commodity or a service. The concept was identified by the geographer Tony Allan in the early 1990s, to draw attention on the global economic processes that ameliorate local water deficits in the MENA region and elsewhere. Since its inception, the virtual water concept has inspired a flourishing literature on how to address global water resource scarcity vis-a-vis commodity production and consumption in a variety of disciplines, but also has been the object of a number of critiques. Against this backdrop, the aim of the study is, first, to conduct a thorough review of the conceptual definition of the concept, its critics and applications. Secondly, to analyze its theoretical underpinnings and, in particular, its relationship with economic theory. The study argues that, despite not being a policy tool itself, the virtual water concept can reveal aspects related to production, consumption and trade in goods which monetary indicators do not capture. Its potential as an indicator for informing decision-making in water management and policy, as well as commodity trade policy, still has to be fully unfolded. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>Prior studies have shown that the acquisition of relevant knowledge by employees in existing firms is associated with the creation of new firms through employee entrepreneurship. Some researchers propose that the transition to entrepreneurship may be explained by established firms undervaluing knowledge created by employees, whereas other scholars maintain that firm strategies may lead to the underutilization of knowledge. We ask the question of which of these drivers is more pronounced as an explanation of employee entrepreneurship and what technological factors matter in this relationship. Analyzing a unique data set, we find that the likelihood of employee entrepreneurship increases with the inventor's assessment of the value of a patent for an invention developed while at the incumbent firm but dramatically decreases when the invention protected by the patent is commercialized by the firm, licensed to third parties, interdependent with other firms' inventions protected by patents, or technologically broad. We also find that conditional on high valuation by the inventor, a matching high valuation by the firm further increases the likelihood of transitioning to entrepreneurship. In combination, we show that a situation when both the inventor and the firm consider the invention valuable but the firm ends up not commercializing the invention is more predictive of employee entrepreneurship than simple differences in assessing the value of the invention. The study refines our understanding of the drivers of entrepreneurship by underscoring the ""strategic"" explanation of employee entrepreneurship.</p>"

<p>We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of stakeholder and shareholder firms in a model of imperfect competition. Stakeholder firms are more concerned with avoiding bankruptcy to protect their employees and suppliers. In equilibrium, they are more valuable than shareholder firms when marginal cost uncertainty exceeds demand uncertainty. With globalization shareholder firms and stakeholder firms often compete. We identify the circumstances where stakeholder firms are more valuable than shareholder firms and compare these mixed equilibria with the pure equilibria with stakeholder and shareholder firms only. Finally, we analyze firm financial constraints and derive implications for the capital structure of stakeholder firms.</p>"

<p>Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts are very widely used for the detection of small shifts. Another similar charting structure is double EWMA (DEWMA) control chart for the improved detection of the shifts. Many interesting features of EWMA and DEWMA have been described in the literature. This study intends to investigate EWMA and DEWMA control charts under Type-I censoring for gamma-distributed lifetimes. The idea of conditional expected values is used to monitor the mean level. The performance evaluations are carried out using average run length as a measure in this study. The optimum sample size comparisons for the specified and unspecified parameter are also part of the study. To assess the overall performance of the control charts, we also used extra quadratic loss and it is found DEWMA is an efficient chart for the detection of shift in scale parameter. Moreover, an illustrative example for practical considerations is included in the study. It is observed that varying censoring rates affect the performance of the chart depending upon the type of chart, the method of estimation, and the amount of shift.</p>"

<p>This paper studies the inventive performance and profitability of small and medium sized firms (SMEs) that are ""technology specialists"" compared to the inventive performance and profitability of SMEs that are instead vertically-integrated. In this paper perspective, ""technology specialists"" are firms that specialize upstream in generating inventions and trade those inventions in disembodied form with other firms, usually through licensing agreements. Instead, vertically-integrated firms are those firms that both generate inventions and commercialize products incorporating those inventions. We argue that technology specialists achieve a higher inventive performance than vertically-integrated firms, since they can accumulate deeper and broader inventive experience, whilst keeping a more flexible organizational structure. These firms display a lower profitability though, due to the imperfections inherent in invention market transactions and the lower bargaining power caused by the lack of commercialization assets. The theoretical framework is tested through a cross-industry investigation on a sample of European SMEs. Implications for the viability of being a technology specialist as a strategy and for the development of markets for technology are discussed. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>The conventional wisdom is that voice leads to desirable outcomes for organizations. However, this is most certainly an oversimplification. Of the over 1,000 studies examining the impact of voice in organizations, the implications of voice vary by the level of the organization (individual, group, organization) as well as the outcome of interest (e.g., group harmony vs. job satisfaction). In this article, we draw from the diverse literatures examining the impact of voice to integrate the theoretical frameworks and empirical results for voice outcomes across organizational levels. To do so, we start with a discussion of the definition and development of voice as a construct, beginning with Hirschman's seminal work on voice/exit/loyalty. We then review the theoretical frameworks within each level that explain the effect of voice on outcomes, highlight the role of mediating or moderating mechanisms, and discuss directions for future research. Finally, we emphasize emerging trends in the study of voice and suggest areas in which the various literatures may benefit from borrowing across fields and levels of interest to produce a more comprehensive, theoretically grounded, and cohesive body of work.</p>"

<p>How do organizations react to stakeholder disapproval of a category to which they belong? In this paper, we draw on the categorization, stigma, and identity literatures in building a theory to predict whether firms that are involved in stigmatized activities will choose to reduce or terminate their involvement in them, as opposed to resorting to less drastic measures such as defensive practice adoption or impression management techniques. Conceptualizing groups of organizations involved in such contentious practices as stigmatized categories in the eyes of an audience, we argue that organizational responses rest on three elements: (1) the intensity of stigma targeting the category, (2) the media exposure of the category, and (3) the extent to which an organization is a member of the category. A quantitative study of proposed new nuclear reactor units in the United States between 1970 and 2000, in the face of mounting opposition to atomic power, provides empirical support for our claims.</p>"

<p>People engage in self-promotional behavior because they want others to hold favorable images of them. Self-promotion, however, entails a trade-off between conveying one's positive attributes and being seen as bragging. We propose that people get this trade-off wrong because they erroneously project their own feelings onto their interaction partners. As a consequence, people overestimate the extent to which recipients of their self-promotion will feel proud of and happy for them, and underestimate the extent to which recipients will feel annoyed (Experiments 1 and 2). Because people tend to promote themselves excessively when trying to make a favorable impression on others, such efforts often backfire, causing targets of self-promotion to view self-promoters as less likeable and as braggarts (Experiment 3).</p>"

<p>We provide evidence on whether providing university students with feedback on their past exam performance affects their future exam performance. Our identification strategy exploits a natural experiment in a leading UK university where different departments have historically different rules on the provision of feedback to their students. We find that the provision of feedback has a positive effect on students' subsequent test scores: the mean impact corresponds to 13% of a standard deviation in test scores. The impact of feedback is stronger for more able students and for students who have less information to start with about the academic environment, while no subset of individuals is found to be discouraged by feedback Our findings suggest that students have imperfect information on how their effort translates into test scores and that the provision of feedback might be a cost-effective means to increase students' exam performance.

<p>Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe and analyse a case of local freight stakeholder involvement to plan and design eco-efficient city logistics innovations in Como, a small city in Italy. While the importance of a well-functioning urban goods distribution system is widely acknowledged, city authorities have become increasingly aware of the need to minimise the negative impacts associated to the system. There are now countless examples of attempts to increase the eco-efficiency of urban freight deliveries; however, very few have made a notable impact. The success of such schemes often depends upon the response of a range of private sector freight stakeholders and their involvement during the planning process of these solutions is crucial.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - To engage local freight stakeholders within the planning process of a city logistics project, the logical framework approach, in the form of the design and monitoring framework (DMF) developed by the Asian Development Bank, has been applied.</p>
<p>Findings - The structured consultation process implied within the DMF approach allowed urban freight stakeholders to share their aspirations from the beginning of the city freight planning process, despite their differences in priorities in adopting eco-efficient logistics innovations. The process ensured that city stakeholders accepted and committed to the city logistics strategies formulated during the consultation process, namely: changes to the Limited Traffic Zone regulation, the use of an urban consolidation centre and hybrid electric truck adoption.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - The evaluation of the DMF application will be definitive after the demonstration/implementation stage of the city logistics project. It will then become clear if freight stakeholders have committed to the project and if it is effective in delivering the expected outputs and outcomes.</p>
<p>Practical implications - Local city authorities may find this method useful in situations where a structured consultation process is needed for addressing urban freight issues. This is especially the case in the context of introducing innovative, eco-efficiency solutions.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The application of DMF in the developed environment can be considered novel; this paper extends this with an application to the promotion of sustainable urban freight.</p>"

<p>High employee turnover rates constitute a major challenge to effective aid provision. This study examines how features of humanitarian work and aid workers' individual characteristics affect retention within one humanitarian organisation, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Holland. The study extends existing research by providing new theoretical explanations of employment opportunities and constraints and by engaging in the first large-scale quantitative analysis of aid worker retention. Using a database of field staff (N=1,955), a logistic regression is performed of the likelihood of reenlistment after a first mission. The findings demonstrate that only 40 per cent of employees reenlist for a second mission with MSF Holland, and that workplace location and security situation, age, and gender have no significant effect. Individuals are less likely to reenlist if they returned early from the first mission for a personal reason, are in a relationship, are medical doctors, or if they come from highly developed countries. The paper reflects on the findings in the light of policy.</p>"

<p>This study examines the relationship between the structure of professional networks and patterns of inter-professional knowledge transfer in the healthcare setting. Collecting survey data and qualitative evidence from 118 professionals in a hospital department, we used theory on the sociology of professions and social networks to investigate patterns of knowledge transfer between doctors and nurses. First we found that members of different professions tend to be embedded in distinctive professional cliques, which in turn inhibit effective inter-professional knowledge transfer. Network structure, however, combines with individual characteristics in predicting knowledge transfer patterns. By occupying central positions in closely knit networks, clinical directors can facilitate knowledge transfer patterns between doctors and nurses. And actors who are legitimated both intra-professionally and inter-professionally to occupy brokerage positions in social networks, namely junior doctors and nurse managers, are more likely to gain access to non-redundant, valuable knowledge. The overall picture is one of network structure interplaying with the characteristics of individual actors in shaping the dynamics of professional interactions.</p>"

<p>The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy to exemestane plus everolimus (EXE/EVE) through a network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized controlled trials. NMA methods extend standard pairwise meta-analysis to allow simultaneous comparison of multiple treatments while maintaining randomization of individual studies. The method enables ""direct"" evidence (i.e., evidence from studies directly comparing two interventions) and ""indirect"" evidence (i.e., evidence from studies that do not compare the two interventions directly) to be pooled under the assumption of evidence consistency. We used NMA to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP) curves in 34 studies, and response rate (RR) and the hazard ratios (HRs) of the PFS/TTP in 36 studies. A number needed to treat (NNT) analysis was also performed as well as descriptive comparison of reported toxicities. The NMA for PFS/TTP curves and for HR shows EXE/EVE is more efficacious than capecitabine plus sunitinib, CMF, megestrol acetate and tamoxifen, with an average of related-PFS/TTP difference ranging from about 10 months for capecitabine plus sunitinib to more than 6 months for tamoxifen. The NMA for overall RR shows that EXE/EVE provides a better RR than bevacizumab plus capecitabine, capecitabine, capecitabine plus sorafenib, capecitabine plus sunitinib, CMF, gemcitabine plus epirubicin plus paclitaxel, EVE plus tamoxifen, EXE, FEC, megestrol acetate, mitoxantrone, and tamoxifen. Finally, the NMA for NNT shows that EXE/EVE is more beneficial as compared to BMF, capecitabine, capecitabine plus sunitinib, CMF, FEC, megestrol acetate, mitoxantrone, and tamoxifen. The combination of EXE/EVE as first- or second-line therapy for ER+ve/HER2-ve metastatic breast cancer is more efficacious than several chemotherapy regimens that were reported in the literature.

Evidence on long-term effectiveness is limited both for Mitraclip and MT. Few studies allow a comparison with MT and comparative results on different endpoints are mixed. Therefore, the available evidence does not conclusively inform whether or under which circumstances Mitraclip should be preferred over MT in the treatment of high-risk patients.

<p>Most studies of the literature find that the development of renewable energy sources determines a decrease in the wholesale prices. Some authors use this finding to state that the current subsidies for renewable technologies cannot be considered as excessive. By carrying out a hybrid analysis (both simulation and ex-post empirical analyses) of the case of photovoltaic energy in Italy, this article demonstrates that this result cannot be generalised. Under market power, an increase in PV production can provide benefits in terms of a wholesale price decrease only beyond a specific threshold and especially if combined with other effects. Otherwise, it is likely that PV development could imply an increase in prices. Therefore, on the one hand, caution is necessary when using the estimated change in wholesale prices to evaluate the net cost for consumers of the supporting policies for renewables: either the simulation-based models or the full empirical analyses may be misleading. On the other hand, if ""decarbonisation"" is the main objective, the energy policies should be designed in order to assure a deep and balanced penetration of the clean technologies, regardless of their estimated transitory impact on wholesale prices (and in the meantime reviewing the organisation of power markets).

<p>This paper investigates the ""weak"" and ""strong"" versions of Porter Hypothesis (PH) focusing on the manufacturing sectors of 17 European countries between 1997 and 2009. The hypothesis that well-crafted and well-enforced regulation would benefit both the environment and the firm was originally proposed by Porter (1991) and Porter and van der Linde (1995). To date, the literature has analyzed the impact of environmental regulation on innovation and on productivity mostly in separate analyses and focusing on the USA. The few existing contributions on Europe study the effect of environmental regulation either on green innovation or on performance indicators such as exports. We instead look at overall innovation and productivity impacts. First, focusing on overall innovative activity allows us to account for potential opportunity costs of induced innovations. Second, productivity impacts are arguably the most relevant indicators for the ""strong"" PH. As a proxy of environmental policy stringency we use pollution abatement and control expenditures (PACE), one of the few sectoral level indicators available. We remedy upon its main drawback, namely potential endogeneity, by adopting an instrumental variable estimation approach. We find evidence of a positive impact of environmental regulation on the output of innovation activity, as proxied by patents, thus providing support in favor of the ""weak"" PH. This result is in line with most of the literature. On the other front, we find no evidence in favor of the ""strong"" PH, as productivity appears to be unaffected by the degree of pollution control and abatement efforts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>Objectives: To quantify and compare the treatment effects on three surrogate end points, progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), and tumor response rate (TR) vs. overall survival (OS) based on a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of drug interventions in advanced colorectal cancer (aCRC).</p>
<p>Study Design and Setting: We systematically searched for RCTs of pharmacologic therapies in aCRC between 2003 and 2013. Trial characteristics, risk of bias, and outcomes were recorded based on a predefined form. Univariate and multivariate random-effects meta-analyses were used to estimate pooled summary treatment effects. The ratio of hazard ratios (HRs)/odds ratios (ORs) and difference in medians were used to quantify the degree of difference in treatment effects on the surrogate end points and OS. Spearman rho, surrogate threshold effect (STE), and R-2 were also estimated across predefined trial-level covariates.</p>
<p>Results: We included 101 RCTs. In univariate and multivariate meta-analyses, we found larger treatment effects for the surrogates than for OS. Compared with OS, treatment effects were on average 13% higher when HRs were measured and 3% to 45% higher when ORs were considered; differences in median PFS/TTP were higher than on OS by an average of 0.5 month. Spearman rho ranged from 0.39 to 0.80, mean R-2 from 0.06 to 0.65, and STE was 0.8 for HRPFS, 0.64 for HRTTP or 0.28 for ORTR. The stratified analyses revealed high variability across all strata.</p>

<p>We study the optimal tariff structure that could induce a regulated utility to promote energy efficiency by its customers given that it is privately informed about the effectiveness of its effort on demand reduction. The regulator should optimally offer a menu of incentive compatible two-part tariffs. If the firm's energy efficiency activities have a high impact on demand reduction, the consumer should pay a high fixed fee but a low per unit price, approximating the tariff structure to a decoupling policy, which strengthens the firm's incentives to pursue energy conservation. Instead, if the firm's effort to adopt energy efficiency actions is scarcely effective, the tariff is characterized by a low fixed fee but a high price per unit of energy consumed, thus shifting the incentives for energy conservation on consumers. The optimal tariff structure also depends on the cost of the consumer's effort (in case the consumer can also adopt energy efficiency measures) and on the degree of substitutability between the consumer's and the firm's efforts.

<p>This paper deals with the construction, decomposition and comparison of water footprint time series in 40 countries and one aggregate macro-region, in the period 1995-2009. The analysis of the different footpaths allows us to investigate the possible causes behind the time evolution of water footprints in the various countries. We notice that the physical and economic impact of economic growth on water resources has been significantly lower than what it could have been, for several reasons. First, both production and consumption patterns are shifting away from water-intensive goods. Second, a large part of consumed water is actually not blue water, susceptible to alternative uses. Finally, we do not find strong evidence of gains in the economic productivity of water (dollars per water unit) in many countries, but we do find evidence of indirect efficiency gains, related to a composition of factors in the production processes.</p>"

<p>The article describes a recent Swiss popular initiative, aiming to replace the current system of statutory health insurance run by 61 competing private insurers with a new system run by a single public insurer. Despite the rejection of the initiative by 62% of voters in late September 2014, the campaign and ballot results are interesting because they show the importance of (effective) public communication in shaping the outcome of a popular ballot. The relevance of the Swiss case goes beyond the peculiarities of its federalism and direct democracy and might be useful for other countries debating the pros and cons of national unitary health insurance systems versus models using multiple insurers.</p>
<p>After this electoral ballot, the project to establish a public sickness fund in Switzerland seems definitely stopped, at least for the next decade. Insurers, who opposed the initiative, have effectively fed the ""fear of change"" of the population and have stressed the good outcomes of the Swiss healthcare system.</p>
<p>However; the, political pressure favoured by the popular initiative opened a ""windows of opportunity"" and led the federal Parliament to pass a stricter regulation of health insurers, improving in this way the current system.

<p>Purpose: The article investigates trends in health sector cutback management strategies occurred during the ongoing financial and fiscal crisis across Europe.</p>
<p>Setting: A European-wide survey to top public healthcare managers was conducted in ten different countries to understand their perception about public sector policy reactions to the financial and economic crisis; answers from 760 respondents from the healthcare sector (30.7% response rate) were analyzed.</p>
<p>Method: A multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the characteristics of respondents, countries' institutional healthcare models and the trend in public health resources availability during the crisis associated to the decision to introduce unselective cuts, targeted cuts or efficiency savings measures.</p>
<p>Results: Differentiated responses to the fiscal crisis that buffeted public finances were reported both across and within countries. Organizational position of respondents is significant in explaining the perceived cutback management approach introduced, where decentralized positions detect a higher use of linear cuts compared to their colleagues working in central level organizations. Compared to Bismark-like systems Beveridge-like ones favour the introduction of targeted cuts. Postponing the implementation of new programmes and containing expenses through instruments like pay freezes are some of the most popular responses adopted, while outright staff layoffs or reduction of frontline services have been more selectively employed.</p>
<p>Conclusion: To cope with the effects of the fiscal crisis healthcare systems are undergoing important changes, possibly also affecting the scope of universal coverage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>In the presence of transactions costs, no matter how small, arbitrage activity does not necessarily render equal all riskless rates of return. When two such rates follow stochastic processes, it is not optimal immediately to arbitrage out any discrepancy that arises between them. The reason is that immediate arbitrage would induce a definite expenditure of transactions costs whereas, without arbitrage intervention, there exists some, perhaps sufficient, probability that these two interest rates will come back together without any costs having been incurred. Hence, one can surmise that at equilibrium the financial market will permit the coexistence of two riskless rates that are not equal to each other. For analogous reasons, randomly fluctuating expected rates of return on risky assets will be allowed to differ even after correction for risk, leading to important violations of the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The combination of randomness in expected rates of return and proportional transactions costs is a serious blow to existing frictionless pricing models. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<p>We present a model of judicial decision making in which the judge overweights the salient facts of the case. The context of the judicial decision, which is comparative by nature, shapes which aspects of the case stand out and draw the judge's attention. By focusing judicial attention on such salient aspects of the case, legally irrelevant information can affect judicial decisions. Our model accounts for a range of recent experimental evidence that bears on the psychology of judicial decisions, including anchoring effects in the setting of damages, decoy effects in choice of legal remedies, and framing effects in the decision to litigate. The model also offers a new approach to positive analysis of damage awards in torts.</p>"

<p>Purpose - Intellectual capital (IC) is fundamental to understanding how firms create value; however, current IC disclosure (ICD) has been described as inadequate due to the lack of an established IC framework and companies' actual commitment to report IC information. The International Integrated Reporting Council aims to foster ICD by means of integrated reporting (IR); such a report should display how IC and other forms of capital (e.g. financial) contribute to value creation over time. Drawing on impression management (IM) studies, the purpose of this paper is to assess the quality of ICD offered in IR.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - A manual content analysis of all the reports available in the International Integrated Reporting Council web site is run considering both the content of ICD and specific linguistic attributes (evidence, time orientation and tone). In addition, the study tests the relationship between the positive ICD tone and specific characteristics that may incentive managers to manipulate their disclosure to determine whether firms use ICD to manage public perceptions of corporate behaviour.</p>
<p>Findings - The results of the content analysis show that majority of ICD is focused on relational capital, with limited quantitative and forward-looking information. Additionally, compared to non-ICD, ICD is significantly more optimistic. Furthermore, the positive tone of ICD is significantly associated with declining performance, bigger size and higher level of intangibles supporting the use of ICD as an IM strategy.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The research contributes to the literature offering evidence of the quality of the ICD offered in the IR and demonstrating that ICD offered in the IR is used by managers opportunistically to advance their image.</p>"

<p>Why do we sanction norm violations? Despite near universal agreement on the role of sanctions for maintaining norms of cooperation, scholars hotly dispute whether individuals sanction based on a rational calculus or because of strong retributive instincts. In this paper we report on a mixed-method field study examining sanctioning behavior. Our goal is to extend theories of sanctioning by evaluating the conditions under which individuals are more likely to administer a sanction in response to a norm violation. To guide the development of our hypotheses, we engage in a qualitative examination of sanctioning decisions in the context of gourmet cuisine. We then test our predictions in a field experiment involving more than 500 gourmet chefs in Italy. Our results suggest that individuals follow retributive instincts, but they also engage in cost-benefit calculations. Indeed, we find that the two logics of sanctioning jointly influence participation in social exchange. Recognizing their own tendency to sanction at a cost, individuals avoid circumstances that could trigger the need for costly sanctions.</p>"

<p>This paper analyzes the effect of skilled migration on two measures of innovation, patenting and bibliometric data, in a panel of 20 European countries between 1995 and 2008. The empirical findings show that a larger pool of migrants in the skilled professions is associated with higher levels of knowledge creation. Skilled migrants contribute both to the creation of ""private"" knowledge, measured by the number of patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty, and to more ""public"" basic research, measured by the number of citations to published articles. This finding is robust, in that it uses both an occupation-based and an education-based index of skilled migration, as well as an instrumental variable estimation accounting for the endogeneity of the skilled migrants indicator and to a number of robustness checks. Our results suggest that policy efforts aiming at attracting skilled migrants to Europe and employing them in skilled professions, such as those put forward in the Europe 2020 Strategy, will indeed foster EU competitiveness in innovation.

<p>Prior studies of IPO underpricing, mostly using agency theory and single-country samples, have generally fallen short. In this study, we employ the knowledge-based view (KBV) to explore underpricing across 17 countries. We find that agency indicators are insignificant predictors, board of director knowledge limits underpricing, and external knowledge both substitutes for and complements internal board knowledge. This third finding suggests that future KBV studies should consider how internal and external knowledge states interact with each other.

<p>The debate on the forecasting ability of non-linear models has a long history, and the Great Recession episode provides an interesting opportunity for a re-assessment of the forecasting performances of several classes of non-linear models. An extensive analysis is performed over a broad cross-country database of the main macroeconomic indicators. The results suggest that, on average, non-linear models cannot outperform standard linear specifications, even during the Great Recession episode. However, non-linear models do lead to an improvement in predictive accuracy in almost 40%-45% of cases, and interesting specific patterns arise across models and variables, though in general the gains are limited. Overall, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that describes this recent recession episode as a sequence of unusually large shocks, rather than as an increase in the degree of non-linearity in the stochastic processes underlying the main macroeconomic time series.

<p>This paper deals with the estimation of monthly indicators of economic activity for the Euro area and its largest member countries that possess the following attributes: relevance, representativeness and timeliness. Relevance is determined by comparing our monthly indicators to the gross domestic product at chained volumes, as the most important measure of the level of economic activity. Representativeness is achieved by considering a very large number of (timely) time series of monthly indicators relating to the level of economic activity, providing a more or less complete coverage. The indicators are modelled using a large-scale parametric factor model. We discuss its specification and provide details of the statistical treatment. Computational efficiency is crucial for the estimation of large-scale parametric factor models of the dimension used in our application (considering about 170 series). To achieve it, we apply state-of-the-art state space methods that can handle temporal aggregation, and any pattern of missing values. (C) 2014 International Institute of Forecasters.

<p>Background: Recent health care policies have supported the adoption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) but examples of failed ICT projects in this sector have highlighted the need for a greater understanding of the processes used to implement such innovations in complex organizations. This study examined the interaction of sociological and technological factors in the implementation of an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system by a major national hospital. It aimed to obtain insights for managers planning such projects in the future and to examine the usefulness of Actor Network Theory (ANT) as a research tool in this context.</p>
<p>Methods: Case study using documentary analysis, interviews and observations. Qualitative thematic analysis drawing on ANT.</p>
<p>Results: Qualitative analyses revealed a complex network of interactions between organizational stakeholders and technology that helped to shape the system and influence its acceptance and adoption. The EMR clearly emerged as a central 'actor' within this network. The results illustrate how important it is to plan innovative and complex information systems with reference to (i) the expressed needs and involvement of different actors, starting from the initial introductory phase; (ii) promoting commitment to the system and adopting a participative approach; (iii) defining and resourcing new roles within the organization capable of supporting and sustaining the change and (iv) assessing system impacts in order to mobilize the network around a common goal.</p>
<p>Conclusions: The paper highlights the organizational, cultural, technological, and financial considerations that should be taken into account when planning strategies for the implementation of EMR systems in hospital settings. It also demonstrates how ANT may be usefully deployed in evaluating such projects.</p>"

<p>We show that the correct experiment to evaluate the effects of a fiscal adjustment is the simulation of a multiyear fiscal plan rather than of individual fiscal shocks. Simulation of fiscal plans adopted by 16 OECD countries over a 30-year period supports the hypothesis that the effects of consolidations depend on their design. Fiscal adjustments based upon spending cuts are much less costly, in terms of output losses, than tax-based ones and have especially low output costs when they consist of permanent rather than stop-and-go changes in taxes and spending. The difference between tax-based and spending-based adjustments appears not to be explained by accompanying policies, including monetary policy. It is mainly due to the different responses of business confidence and private investment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>We analyze the possibility of reduction of systemic risk in financial markets through Pigouvian taxation of financial institutions, which is used to support the rescue fund. We introduce the concept of the cascade risk with a clear operational definition as a subclass and a network related measure of the systemic risk. Using financial networks constructed from real Italian money market data and using realistic parameters, we show that the cascade risk can be substantially reduced by a small rate of taxation and by means of a simple strategy of the money transfer from the rescue fund to interbanking market subjects. Furthermore, we show that while negative effects on the return on investment (ROI) are direct and certain, an overall positive effect on risk adjusted return on investments (ROIRA) is visible. Please note that the taxation is introduced as a monetary/regulatory, not as a_scal measure, as the term could suggest. The rescue fund is implemented in a form of a common reserve fund.</p>"

<p>Objectives: The aim of this study was to review and compare current health technology assessment (HTA) activities for medical devices across non-European Union HTA agencies.</p>
<p>Methods: HTA activities for medical devices were evaluated from three perspectives: organizational structure, processes, and methods. Agencies were primarily selected upon membership of existing HTA networks. The data collection was performed in two stages: stage 1-agency Web-site assessment using a standardized questionnaire, followed by review and validation of the collected data by a representative of the agency; and stage 2-semi-structured telephone interviews with key informants of a sub-sample of agencies.</p>
<p>Results: In total, thirty-six HTA agencies across twenty non-EU countries assessing medical devices were included. Twenty-seven of thirty-six (75 percent) agencies were judged at stage 1 to have adopted HTA-specific approaches for medical devices (MD-specific agencies) that were largely organizational or procedural. There appeared to be few differences in the organization, process and methods between MD-specific and non-MD-specific agencies. Although the majority (69 percent) of both categories of agency had specific methods guidance or policy for evidence submission, only one MD-specific agency had developed methodological guidelines specific to medical devices. In stage 2, many MD-specific agencies cited insufficient resources (budget, skilled employees), lack of coordination (between regulator and reimbursement bodies), and the inability to generalize findings from evidence synthesis to be key challenges in the HTA of medical devices.</p>
<p>Conclusions: The lack of evidence for differentiation in scientific methods for HTA of devices raises the question of whether HTA needs to develop new methods for medical devices but rather adapt existing methodological approaches. In contrast, organizational and/or procedural adaptation of existing HTA agency frameworks to accommodate medical devices appear relatively commonplace.</p>"

<p>We study direct democracy with population uncertainty. Voters' participation is often among the desiderata by the election designer. We show that with a participation quorum, i.e. a threshold on the fraction of participating voters below which the status quo is kept, the status quo may be kept in situations where the planner would prefer the reform, or the reform is passed when the planner prefers the status quo. On the other hand, using an approval quorum, i.e. a threshold on the number of voters expressing a ballot in favor of the reform below which the status quo is kept, we show that those drawbacks of participation quorums are avoided. Moreover, an electoral system with approval quorum performs better than one with participation quorum even when the planner wishes to implement the corresponding participation quorum social choice function.</p>"

<p>How can a decision-maker assess the potential of environmental policies when a group of experts provides divergent estimates on their effectiveness? To address this question, we propose and analyze a variant of the well-studied -maxmin model in decision theory. In our framework, and consistent to the paper's empirical focus on renewable-energy R&D investment, experts' subjective probability distributions are allowed to be action-dependent. In addition, the decision maker constrains the sets of priors to be considered via a parsimonious measure of their distance to a benchmark ""average"" distribution that grants equal weight to all experts. While our model is formally rooted in the decision-theoretic framework of Olszewski (Rev Econ Stud 74:567-595, 2007), it may also be viewed as a structured form of sensitivity analysis. We apply our framework to original data from a recent expert elicitation survey on solar energy. The analysis suggests that more aggressive investment in solar energy R&D is likely to yield significant dividends even, or rather especially, after taking expert ambiguity into account.</p>"

<p>To be efficient, flexible labor markets require geographically mobile workers. Otherwise firms can take advantage of workers' immobility and extract rents at their expense. In cultures with strong family ties, moving away from home is costly. Thus, to limit the rents of firms and to avoid moving, individuals with strong family ties rationally choose regulated labor markets, even though regulation generates higher unemployment and lower incomes. Empirically, we find that individuals who inherit stronger family ties are less mobile, have lower wages and higher unemployment, and support more stringent labor market regulations. We find a positive association between labor market rigidities at the beginning of the 21st century and family values prevailing before World War II, and between family structures in the Middle Ages and current desire for labor market regulation. Both results suggest that labor market regulations have deep cultural roots.</p>"

<p>Across three studies, we investigate men's reactions to women in superior roles. Drawing from precarious manhood theory, we hypothesize that when a woman occupies a superior organizational role, men in subordinate positions experience threat, which leads them to behave more assertively toward her and advocate for themselves. In Studies 1 and 2, we demonstrate that men feel more threatened (relative to women) by women in superior roles (relative to men in superior roles) and, as a result, engage in more assertive behaviors toward these women. In Study 3, we investigate a boundary condition to this effect and demonstrate that a woman in a superior role who displays qualities associated with administrative agency (e.g., directness, proactivity) rather than ambitious agency (e.g., self-promotion, power-seeking) elicits less assertive behavior from men. We conclude by discussing implications as well as directions for future research.</p>"

<p>We explore theoretically and experimentally the general equilibrium price and allocation implications of delegated portfolio management when the investor-manager relationship is nonexclusive. Our theory predicts that competition forces managers to promise portfolios that mimic Arrow-Debreu (AD) securities, which investors then combine to fit their preferences. A weak version of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) obtains, where state prices (relative to state probabilities) implicit in prices of traded securities will be inversely ranked to aggregate wealth across states. Our experiment broadly corroborates the price and choice predictions of the theory. However, price quality deteriorates when only a few managers attract most of the available wealth. Wealth concentration increases because funds flow toward managers who offer portfolios closer to replicating AD securities (as in the theory), but also because funds flow to managers who had better performance in the immediate past (an observation unrelated to the theory).</p>"

<p>Volume and increase of spending in the health sector contribute to economic growth, but do not consistently relate with better health. Instead, unsatisfactory health trends, health systems' inefficiencies, and high costs are linked to the globalization of a growth society dominated by neoliberal economic ideas and policies of privatization, deregulation, and liberalization. A degrowth approach, understood as frame that connects diverse ideas, concepts, and proposals alternative to growth as a societal objective, can contribute to better health and a more efficient use of health systems. However, action for change of individual and collective behaviors alone is not enough to influence social determinants and counteract powerful and harmful market forces. The quality and characteristics of health policies need to be rethought, and public policies in all sectors should be formulated taking into consideration their impact on health. A paradigmatic shift toward a more caring, equitable, and sustainable degrowth society will require supportive policies at national level and citizens' engagement at community level. Nevertheless, due to global interdependence and the unavoidable interactions between global forces and national systems, a deep rethinking of global health governance and its reformulation into global governance for health are essential. To support degrowth and health, a strong alliance between committed national and global leaderships, above all the World Health Organization, and a well-informed, transnationally interconnected, worldwide active civil society is essential to include and defend health objectives and priorities in all policies and at all levels, including through the regulation of global market forces.</p>"

<p>This paper investigates the development of wholesale markets for natural gas at the different stages of market liberalization. We identify three steps in the process: wholesale trade initially develops to cope with balancing needs when the shippers and suppliers segments become more fragmented; once the market becomes more liquid, it turns out to be a second source of gas procurement in alternative to long term contracts; finally, to manage price risk financial instruments are traded. We review in detail the different regulatory measures that must be introduced to create an efficient and functioning wholesale gas market. Finally, we analyze the evolution of gas hubs in the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy in terms of market rules and market liquidity. We argue that each of these country cases can be easily located into the evolutionary path we have highlighted at the beginning, with the UK and the Netherlands leading the process, Germany and Italy constrained by limited supply; Italy is also showing an interesting counterfactual.

<p>We propose a new general approach for estimating the effect of a binary treatment on a continuous and potentially highly skewed response variable, the generalized quantile treatment effect (GQTE). The GQTE is defined as the difference between a function of the quantiles under the two treatment conditions. As such, it represents a generalization over the standard approaches typically used for estimating a treatment effect (i.e., the average treatment effect and the quantile treatment effect) because it allows the comparison of any arbitrary characteristic of the outcome's distribution under the two treatments. Following Dominici et al. (2005), we assume that a pre-specified transformation of the two quantiles is modeled as a smooth function of the percentiles. This assumption allows us to link the two quantile functions and thus to borrow information from one distribution to the other. The main theoretical contribution we provide is the analytical derivation of a closed form expression for the likelihood of the model. Exploiting this result we propose a novel Bayesian inferential methodology for the GQTE. We show some finite sample properties of our approach through a simulation study which confirms that in some cases it performs better than other nonparametric methods. As an illustration we finally apply our methodology to the 1987 National Medicare Expenditure Survey data to estimate the difference in the single hospitalization medical cost distributions between cases (i.e., subjects affected by smoking attributable diseases) and controls.</p>"

Then, the identitarian dimension of the architectural phenomenon is addressed to show that public architectural art can be, at the same time, an expression of individuals, communities and the state where by 'expression' we refer to both the interests involved and the reason why protection is given to a specific interest. This exercise aims at understanding how to cope with copyright instability in public architectural art and face the unpredictable effects that it may cause by giving a more concrete meaning to 'the public interest', and, more precisely, by giving more substance to the identities that this concept expresses.</p>"

<p>The conventional wisdom is (i) that fiscal austerity was the main culprit for the recessions experienced by many countries, especially in Europe, since 2010 and (ii) that this round of fiscal consolidation was much more costly than past ones. The contribution of this paper is a clarification of the first point and, if not a clear rejection, at least it raises doubts on the second. In order to obtain these results we construct a new detailed ""narrative"" dataset which documents the size and composition of the fiscal plans implemented by several countries over 2009-13. Out of sample simulations, that project output growth conditional only upon the fiscal plans implemented since 2009, do reasonably well in predicting the total output fluctuations of the countries in our sample over the years 2010-13 and are also capable of explaining some of the cross-country heterogeneity in this variable. Fiscal adjustments based on cuts in spending appear to have been much less costly, in terms of output losses, than those based on tax increases. Our results, however, are mute on the question whether the countries we study did the right thing implementing fiscal austerity at the time they did, that is 2009-13.</p>"

<p>Aim of this study was to estimate the cost that is borne by the Italian National Health Service, families, and social security due to very low birth weight infants (VLBWIs) without prematurity-related morbidities up to the age of 18 months.

The average length of the primary hospitalisation of the VLBWIs was 59.7 days (SD 21.6 days), with a total cost of (sic)20,502 (SD (sic)8409), compared with three days (SD 0.4 days) with a total cost of (sic)907 (SD (sic)304) for the FTIs.

<p>We survey the literature documenting the rise of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), which, with assets under management of over $5.4 trillion at year-end 2014, are a major force in global finance. Research papers have analyzed the evolution of SWFs from stabilization funds to stand-alone wealth management funds; we both survey this research and show that more than 25 countries have launched or proposed new SWFs since January 2008. The most salient and controversial feature of SWFs is that they are state-owned; we survey the existing literature on state ownership and discuss what this predicts about the efficiency and beneficence of government control of SWF assets. We discuss the documented importance of SWF funding sources (oil sales revenues versus excess reserves from export earnings) and survey the normative literature describing how SWFs should allocate funds. We then summarize the empirical literature studying how SWFs actually do allocate fundsacross asset classes, geographically, and across industries. We document that most SWF equity investments in publicly traded firms involve cross-border purchases of sizeable minority stakes (median around 20%) in target firms, with a strong preference for investments in the financial sector. Next, we assess empirical studies examining the impact of SWF stock investments on target firm financial and operating performance, and find universal support for a positive announcement period stock price increase of 1-3%. This, however, is significantly lower than the 5% abnormal return documented for stock purchases by comparable privately owned financial investors in recent studies, indicating a sovereign wealth fund discount. We conclude by summarizing the lessons of SWF research and pointing out unresolved issues.</p>"

Approximately one-third of gas stations responded within a day to targeted competitors' price changes, indicating some evidence of price matching behavior in the industry. Additionally, there is some, but discontinuous, geographical price propagation, testifying to the presence of a weak domino effect.

<p>I examine the post-war economic development of two regions in southern Italy exposed to mafia activity after the 1970s and apply synthetic control methods to estimate their economic performance in the absence of organised crime. The comparison of actual and counterfactual development shows that the presence of mafia lowers GDP per capita by 16%. Evidence from electricity consumption and growth accounting suggests that lower GDP reflects a net loss of economic activity, due to the substitution of private capital with less productive public investment, rather than a mere reallocation of resources from the official to the unofficial sector.</p>"

<p>Background: Recent improvements in the identification of the genetic basis of long QT syndrome (LQTS) have led to significant changes in the diagnosis and management of this life-threatening condition. Genetic and electrocardiogram (ECG) tests are the most relevant examples among testing strategies for LQTS, yet their cost-effectiveness remains controversial. Objective: The aim of this work was to review the available evidence on the cost-effectiveness of genetic and ECG testing strategies for the diagnosis of LQTS. Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature on the cost-effectiveness of genetic and ECG screening strategies for the early detection of LQTS using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CRD databases between 2000 and 2013. A weighted version of Drummond checklist was instrumental in further assessing the quality of the included studies. Results: We identified four eligible articles. Among them, genetic testing in the early detection of LQTS was cost-effective compared with no testing in symptomatic cases and not cost-effective when compared with watchful waiting in asymptomatic first-degree relatives of patients with established LQTS although it reached cost-effectiveness in higher risk subgroups, whereas ECG testing in neonates was highly cost-effective when compared with any screening strategy. Conclusions: LQTS profiling and patients' stratification have the potential to improve the disease management. Because of the limited current knowledge in this field, the present review recommends to perform further cost-effectiveness evaluations of the genetic and ECG screening alternatives, especially within European health care systems, which are still not available in the literature on genetic testing.

<p>This article provides an overview of the main traits of the historical development of the pharmaceutical industry, using the lenses of the evolutionary approach to economic and industrial change. After a brief overview of the main evolutionary concepts which guide the subsequent discussion, our presentation identifies four main eras: from the formative stages (from the late 1800s to War World II) to the so-called Golden Age (the 1940s to the mid-1970s), the biotechnology revolution (the 1970s to the new millennium, approximately) and what we label the 'Winter of Discontent?' (the first decade of the new century). Within all these epochs, we discuss the main trends in technology, firms' strategies and structures, patterns of competition, demand, regulation and institutional developments. Section 6 concludes the article, briefly discussing some main implications for the present and future of the industry on the one hand and for the relevance of an evolutionary approach to the analysis of corporate and industrial change on the other.</p>"

<p>From the beginning of the 1950s, how to size clothing became an issue debated within national and international organisations which were committed to the standardisation of the technical specifications of industrial products, clothing included. At the time the Gruppo Finanziario Tessile (GFT), which would later act as the industrial springboard for the Italian fashion, introduced a new system of sizes in Italy. Drawing on the company's extensive historical records, the article deals with the technical, organisational, and cultural nature of the process of standardisation of the sizing of clothing.

<p>BackgroundThe clinical benefits of prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia are well-established and include the following: reduced bleeding episodes, prevention of joint damage, decreased inhibitor development, and improved health-related quality of life. However, the cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis is still not clear.</p>
<p>ProceduresWe reviewed the published hemophilia prophylaxis economic models focusing on utility assumptions.</p>
<p>ResultsWe found six cost-utility studies that compared prophylaxis and on-demand regimens. These studies reported remarkably different results, using utility values based on different assumptions and data sources.</p>
<p>ConclusionsWe suggest that cooperation among key stakeholders (clinicians, patient organizations and health-care decision makers) as a means of collecting evidence-based and experiential data to represent both the utility and the quality of life changes for patients with Hemophilia A who are treated with prophylaxis or receive on-demand treatments may represent a winning strategy with which to resolve the outstanding issues related to health technology assessments in the care of patients with hemophilia.

<p>In this paper we propose a stylized model to study how cohesion may affect the spread and consolidation of altruism in a large population where agents are involved in a local public-good contribution game with their neighbors. We show that, if the contribution cost is moderate (neither too high nor too low), cooperation can invade and dominate the population if, and only if, group cohesion displays an intermediate value. This reflects an interesting non-monotonicity of cohesion in the evolution of altruism: while some of it is needed to internalize the benefits of cooperation, too much cohesion prevents the spread of altruism among the population at large.

<p>Individual differences in convergent and divergent thinking may uniquely explain variation in analogical reasoning ability. Across two studies we investigated the relative influences of divergent and convergent thinking as predictors of verbal analogy performance. Performance on both convergent thinking (i.e., Remote Associates Test) and divergent thinking (i.e., Alternative Uses Task) uniquely predicted performance on both analogy selection (Studies 1 and 2) and analogical generation tasks (Study 2). Moreover, convergent and divergent thinking were predictive above and beyond creative behaviours in Study 1 and a composite measure of crystallised intelligence in Study 2. Verbal analogies in Study 2 also varied in semantic distance, with results demonstrating divergent thinking as a stronger predictor of analogy generation for semantically far than for semantically near analogies.

<p>Many common words have spatial associations (e.g., ""bird,"" ""jump"") that, counterintuitively, hinder identification of visual targets at their associated location. For example, ""bird"" hinders identification at the top of a display. This spatial interference has been attributed to perceptual competition: ""bird"" shifts attention upward and evokes the perceptual representation of a bird, which impairs identification of an unrelated target by preoccupying the visual system. We propose an alternative explanation based on perceptual matching: target objects and locations are coded independently for their congruence with the cue word, and codes that are inconsistent with one another hinder identification. Two experiments demonstrated that whereas semantically mismatching targets elicit spatial interference, semantically matching targets elicit spatial facilitation. Two further experiments demonstrated that cue words of strong (e.g., ""bird"") and weak (e.g., ""arise"") visual strength and imageability elicited equivalent spatial interference. Results suggest that spatial interference is attributable to perceptual matching rather than perceptual competition. Moreover, results supported a graded model of perceptual matching, whereby target identification times are proportional to the physical distance between the expected (i.e., associated) and observed (i.e., actual) target locations.

<p>We present results from an experiment with multiple public goods, where each good produces benefits only if total contributions to it reach a minimum threshold. The presence of multiple public goods makes coordination among participants more difficult, discouraging donor participation and decreasing the likelihood of any public good being effectively funded. Applied to the case of fundraising, the results show how overall donations and the number of effectively funded projects may both decrease as the total number of projects vying for funding increases. The analysis considers whether making one of the contribution options salient, either through its merits or by arbitrarily choosing one to feature during the experiment, helps overcome the increased coordination problem. The results have implications for the growing popularity of crowdfunding websites, and suggest benefits to these sites from helping donors compare and identify the most promising projects.

<p>Purpose - The era of austerity that has followed the outbreak of the global financial crisis has posed a myriad of challenges for public services, with demands for major cuts in government spending, the delivery of balanced budgets and zstrategies for deficit reduction. The purpose of this paper is to consider how public sector accounting and accountability systems are implicated in the development and implementation of austerity policies. Also, it pinpoints a range of issues that accounting researchers need to be contemplating on the subject of accounting for austerity.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - Interdisciplinary literature review, coupled with an illustrative discussion of the changing nature of public sector accounting practices under austerity.</p>
<p>Findings - Despite the significance and scale of austerity, public sector accounting research on the topic is in its infancy, with the prominent focus being on how accounting technologies are used to manage austerity. There have been few attempts to debate critically the construction of austerity and to provide alternative accounts of austerity. Accounting for austerity, especially in terms of its implications and consequences, is far too complex and challenging to be categorized as simply seeking to ""balance the books"".</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - As an academic community, we need to be developing understanding of public sector accounting research under austerity across different organizational levels and contexts. Also, we should be framing the accounts of austerity in ways that respect and build on a sound understanding of the extensive available interdisciplinary research on this topic. Key research questions to address include: how is accounting shaping constructions of, and impressions, attitudes and behaviors toward, austerity and the status of governments and public service organizations? What do such patterns of development mean for the roles and contributions of public sector accountants under austerity? Are accounting systems destined to be used primarily as vehicles for cost-cutting, or can they be used as engines for growth and for thinking about public service responsibilities in more socially inclusive forms?</p>
<p>Originality/value - Accountings of austerity in the field of public sector accounting research have been worryingly limited. This paper and the papers in this special issue of AAAJ address such failings, revealing a range of critical implications and challenges of austerity policies for public sector accounting research.</p>"

<p>Thailand is among the first non-OECD countries to have introduced a form of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). This policy represents a natural experiment to evaluate the effects of public health insurance on health behaviours. In this paper, we examine the impact of Thailand's UHC programme on preventive activities, unhealthy or risky behaviours and health care consumption using data from the Thai Health and Welfare Survey. We use doubly robust estimators that combine propensity scores and linear regressions to estimate differences-in-differences (DD) and differences-in-DD models. Our results offer important insights. First, UHC increases individuals' likelihood of having an annual check-up, especially among women. Regarding health care consumption, we observe that UHC increases hospital admissions by over 2% and increases outpatient visits by 13%. However, there is no evidence that UHC leads to an increase in unhealthy behaviours or a reduction of preventive efforts. In other words, we find no evidence of ex ante moral hazard. Overall, these findings suggest positive health impacts among the Thai population covered by UHC.</p>"

<p>Entrepreneurship is considered to be one of the most important engines of growth, and its determinants are widely investigated. Several theories of entrepreneurship have been proposed and tested in the literature, most of them focusing on hard factors, i.e., determinants related to the quality/quantity of inputs and to the size of the market. In this paper, I investigate how the interaction between hard and soft factors may shape the entrepreneurial behavior of individuals. In particular, the aim of the paper is to explore the links among the structure of the family, land inequality at the beginning of the twentieth century, and subsequent entrepreneurship in Italian provinces. Using a novel data set on the Gini coefficient of land inequality in 1931, sharecropping in 1911, and the classification of family structures in 1950, I test their relevance to explaining entrepreneurship. I find that high land concentration with strong family ties reduces the probability of becoming an entrepreneur. Furthermore, the diffusion of sharecropping contracts is associated with higher entrepreneurship rates. Taken together, these results point to a central role played by the organization of agriculture in promoting entrepreneurship.</p>"

Our article assesses whether the information citizens consider to be most relevant for interaction with the authorities is actually disclosed.

A sample of 500 Italian citizens were interviewed with the purpose of understanding which type of information they consider most relevant, given the choice of institutional, political, financial, and service delivery-related information. The results indicate that Italian provincial capitals currently fail to publish the information that citizens consider to be most relevant: Despite differences in opinions among users, the sample we analyzed tends to rate the importance of service-delivery transparency and financial transparency higher than institutional or political transparency, whereas most information disclosed by Italian provincial capitals is associated with data they are obliged to disclose in order to comply with transparency regulations.</p>"

<p>Drawing on fairness heuristic theory and literature on negative group schemas, we develop and empirically test the idea that, given the exact same decision outcome, people perceive groups to be less fair than individuals when they receive a decision outcome that is unfavorable, but not when they receive one that is favorable or neutral (Studies 1 and 2). To account for this difference in fairness perceptions following an unfavorable outcome, we show that the mere presence of a group as a decision-making body serves as a cue that increases the accessibility of negative group-related associations in a perceiver's mind (Study 3). Moreover, in a sample of recently laid-off workers-representing a broad range of organizations and demographic characteristics-we demonstrate that those who received a layoff decision made by a group of decision makers (versus an individual) are marginally more likely to perceive the decision as unfair and are marginally less likely to endorse the organization (Study 4). Taken together, the results of all four studies suggest that, in response to the same unfavorable decision outcome, a group of decision makers is often perceived to be less fair than an individual.</p>"

<p>This paper reassesses the relationship between tax structure and long-run income, using as indicators of tax structure both a new series of implicit tax rates based on Mendoza et al. (J Public Econ 66:99-126, 1997) and tax ratios, adopting a dynamic panel estimation strategy, and explicitly accounting for cross-sectional dependence in the panel. When implicit tax rates are used, the paper shows that the link between tax structure and long-run income per capita is not robust to the adoption of different assumptions on observable and unobservable heterogeneity across countries. When tax ratios are used, there is some evidence of a negative impact of labour taxation on long-run income, but this result is shown to capture non-fiscal effects coming from the evolution of the labour share. Turning to the short run, the research presented here finds strong evidence of a positive effect on per capita income of a tax shift from labour and capital taxation towards consumption taxation, which provides support for fiscal devaluations.</p>"

<p>Adelman, Marquis, Sabatos-DeVito, and Estes (2013) collected word naming latencies from 4 participants who read 2,820 words 50 times each. Their recommendation and practice was that R-2 targets set for models should take into account subject idiosyncrasies as replicable patterns, equivalent to a subjects-as-fixed-effects assumption. In light of an interaction involving subjects, they broke down the interaction into individual subject data. Courrieu and Rey's (2015) commentary argues that (a) single-subject data need not be more reliable than subject-average data, and (b) anyway, treating groups of subjects as random samples leads to valid conclusions about general mechanisms of reading. Point (a) was not part of Adelman et al.'s claim. In this reply, we examine the consequences of using the fixed-effect assumption. It (a) produces the correct target to check if by-items regression models contain all necessary variables, (b) more accurately constrains cognitive models, (c) more accurately reveals general mechanisms, and (d) can offer more powerful tests of effects. Even when individual differences are not the primary focus of a study, the fixed-effect analysis is often preferable to the random-effects analysis.</p>"

<p>This article analyses and compares the multi-dimensional co-ordination of employment and social policies at the Italian local level, especially focusing on the policy implementation stage. It departs from developing a theoretical framework to take into account the crucial variables that might potentially impact on the co-ordination of social cohesion policies. In particular, following a neo-institutionalist approach, great emphasis is placed on the legacy of the Weberian bureaucratic model, and its implied specialisation ethos'. In addition, the effect of other contextual variables, such us social capital and the rate of unemployment, are considered. The empirical analysis confirms the crucial impact of the specialisation ethos in preventing inter-policy co-ordination from occurring at the Italian local level, and the relevance of other contextual variables in causing policy integration within services, rather than between services.</p>"

<p>Background: Lean seems to be the next revolution for a better, improved, value-based heal-hcare. In the last 15 years Lean has been increasingly adapted and adopted in healthcare. Accordingly, Lean healthcare has been developing into a major strand of research since the early 2000s. The aim of this work is to present a comprehensive overview of the main issues highlighted by research on implementation of Lean in a complex contest such as the healthcare one.</p>
<p>Method: Comprehensive literature review was conducted in order to identify empirical and theoretical articles published up to September 2013. Thematic analysis was performed in order to extract and synthesis data.</p>
<p>Findings: 243 articles were selected for analysis. Lean is best understood as a means to increase productivity. Hospital is the more explored setting, with emergency and surgery as the pioneer departments. USA appears to be the leading country for number of applications. The theoretical works have been focused mainly on barriers, challenges and success factors. Sustainability, framework for measurement and critical appraisal remain underestimated themes. Evaluations of ""system wide approach"" are still low in number.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Even though Lean results appear to be promising, findings so far do not allow to draw a final word on its positive impacts or challenges when introduced in the healthcare sector. Scholars are called to explore further the potentiality and the weaknesses of Lean, above all as for the magnitude of investments required and for the engagement of the whole organization it represents increasingly strategic choice, whilst health professionals, managers and policy makers could and should learn from research how to play a pivotal role for a more effective implementation of lean in different health contexts.

<p>The combination of increasing immigration pressures and restrictive policies imperfectly enforced by many destination countries has made illegal immigration widespread. This article provides an overview of the mechanisms behind the formation of migration policies and how they lead to or limit the presence of illegal immigrants. We also study how governments deal ex post with the presence of undocumented foreign workers by introducing immigration amnesties. We review the determinants of their introduction and address their desirability from the point of view of aggregate welfare. As countries in the European Union differ substantially in the implementation of both ex ante and ex post immigration policies, we emphasize the need for more coordination in the area of migration policy enforcement, both at the border and within each country (JEL codes: F22, J61).</p>"

<p>The majority of the European countries experienced a turn towards activation policies during the last decades. The aim of increasing employment rates of groups formerly excluded from the labour market has required closer links with training, family or social policies with employment policy. As a result of this, we can observe modifications also in regard to policy governance, particularly emphasizing the role of the local level in implementing integrated activation policies. This article aims at testing the hypothesis of whether higher levels of stakeholder participation in the policy process lead to greater policy integration. In an explorative manner, the research hypothesis will be tested with reference to two very different cases of local activation policy. Driving factors for the differential impact of participation on policy integration will be identified through the analysis of two in-depth case studies. A qualitative process-tracing method is used in order to conduct our analysis.</p>"

<p>This paper analyses the role played by individual subjective well-being (SWB) in childbearing behavior. We use the German Socio Economic Panel (GSOEP) survey, which contains repeated information about SWB, childbearing events and, importantly, also measures of respondents' personality, to estimate the way SWB matters for having a(nother) child, controlling for personality traits (PTs). We find that SWB positively predicts childbearing for women and men, with the effect significant (and sizeable) for both genders only for the second child. Furthermore, we assure that - although PTs are a strong component of SWB variability - the effect of SWB on fertility is not determined by PTs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Background: Health care organizations are pressured to improve the cost-effectiveness of service delivery. Clinical governance is an important trigger to improve care quality and safety and rank high in the reform agenda of health systems. The senior management team culture plays a major role in establishing clinical governance practices, because it strongly influences the values, attitudes, and behaviors of the members of an organization.</p>
<p>Purposes: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between senior management team culture and clinical governance in the public health care organizations of three Italian regions.</p>
<p>Methodology: The assessment of senior management culture was conducted using the Competing Values Framework and a corresponding instrument adapted for the Italian context. Clinical governance was assessed using an ad hoc instrument focused on the senior management team's perception and attitude toward clinical governance.</p>
<p>Findings: The survey achieved a 54% response rate. The results of four different models demonstrate that organizations characterized by different dominant cultures are associated with significant differences in attitudes toward clinical governance. In particular, on average, dominant cultures with a prevailing external focus are associated with a more positive attitude toward clinical governance.</p>
<p>Practice Implications: The selection and appointments of top managers should consider the style of leadership that is most apt to facilitate the growth of rational and developmental cultures. Furthermore, the training of top managers and leading doctors should reinforce leadership aptitude and approaches that are consistent with the desired organizational cultures.</p>"

Different types of loss functions are considered for Bayesian estimation. Furthermore, the Bayes estimators and their respective posterior risks are computed and compared using Gibbs sampling. The different reliability characteristics including hazard function, stress and strength analysis, and mean residual life function are also derived. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to compare the performances of the proposed methods of estimation and two real data sets have been analysed for illustrative purposes.</p>"

<p>Strategies for dealing with climate change must incorporate and quantify all the relevant uncertainties, and be designed to manage the resulting risks(1). Here we employ the best available knowledge so far, summarized by the three working groups of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5; refs 2-4), to quantify the uncertainty of mitigation costs, climate change dynamics, and economic damage for alternative carbon budgets. We rank climate policies according to different decision-making criteria concerning uncertainty, risk aversion and intertemporal preferences. Our findings show that preferences over uncertainties are as important as the choice of the widely discussed time discount factor. Climate policies consistent with limiting warming to 2 degrees C above preindustrial levels are compatible with a subset of decision-making criteria and some model parametrizations, but not with the commonly adopted expected utility framework.</p>"

<p>This study provides simulations showing what global and regional population sizes would be if the rest of the world would have experienced similar population growth patterns as what was observed in Europe during the demographic transition. In 1820-2010, slower growth was observed in Europe & North America where population increased by 4.6 times to a level of 1088 million. The population of Asia increased from 720 million to 4165 million. However, the biggest change from 1820 to 2010 was observed in regions that had relatively small populations in 1820 - Latin America (which increased by 38 times to 597 million) and Africa (which increased by 14 times to 1031 million). Our simulations show that if the French pattern of population growth had been followed (French population size increasing by 2.5 from 1820-2010), the global population would have merely doubled during the demographic transition (increasing to 2.02 times its original size) over the 1820-2010 period. All regions would have had a significantly lower population size: Europe & North America would have increased to 474 million and Asia to 1453 million, while Africa would have grown to 150 million, which is just 15% of its current population. Projections suggest that population implications of following the in the coming decades would have been much lower. While UN median variant projections suggest that it would reach 914 million people by 2100. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Objective: Taking into account patients' preferences has become an essential requirement in health decision-making. Even in evidence-based settings where directions are summarized into clinical practice guidelines, there might exist situations where it is important for the care provider to involve the patient in the decision. In this paper we propose a unified framework to promote the shift from a traditional, physician-centered, clinical decision process to a more personalized, patient-oriented shared decision-making (SDM) environment.</p>
<p>Methods: We present the theoretical, technological and architectural aspects of a framework that encapsulates decision models and instruments to elicit patients' preferences into a single tool, thus enabling physicians to exploit evidence-based medicine and shared decision-making in the same encounter.</p>
<p>Results: We show the implementation of the framework in a specific case study related to the prevention and management of the risk of thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation. We describe the underlying decision model and how this can be personalized according to patients' preferences. The application of the framework is tested through a pilot clinical evaluation study carried out on 20 patients at the Rehabilitation Cardiology Unit at the IRCCS Fondazione Salvatore Maugeri hospital (Pavia, Italy). The results point out the importance of running personalized decision models, which can substantially differ from models quantified with population coefficients.</p>
<p>Conclusions: This study shows that the tool is potentially able to overcome some of the main barriers perceived by physicians in the adoption of SDM. In parallel, the development of the framework increases the involvement of patients in the process of care focusing on the centrality of individual patients. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<p>How do subsidiaries respond to normative demands from both their headquarters and local external constituents? We propose that subsidiaries pay varying levels of attention to demands depending on their peers' norm-conforming behavior, resulting in heterogeneous practice implementation. We study the implementation of 25 practices, associated with three corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues in 101 worldwide subsidiaries of a multinational enterprise (MNE). Consistent with the idea that attention is limited and therefore selective, we find that external peers' conformity to the CSR norm directs subsidiaries' attention toward the CSR-related demands of external constituents at the expense of the demands from the headquarters. However, internal peers' conformity increases attention to both external and headquarters' demands related to CSR. As higher attention levels result in higher practice implementation, internal and external peers' conformity drives the heterogeneity of practice implementation in the MNE. Our results suggest the need to rethink the influence of peers' conformity on subsidiaries' implementation of practices, as it not only triggers mimicry based on legitimacy but also and simultaneously a more strategic response based on internal and external competitive threats and attention allocation.</p>"

Methods: We conducted a systematic review of position statements, policies, guidelines, and recommendations, produced by professional organizations or other relevant bodies for use of DTC GT in Europe. Results: Seventeen documents met the inclusion criteria, which were subjected to thematic analysis, and the texts were coded for statements related to use of DTC GT. Discussion and Conclusions: Professional societies and associations are currently more suggestive of potential disadvantages of DTC GT, recommending improved genetic literacy of both populations and health professionals, and implementation research on the genetic tests to integrate public health genomics into healthcare systems.</p>"

Using a sample of bond credit spreads from 43 countries over 1991 2010, we find that government ownership is generally associated with a higher cost of debt, consistent with state-induced investment distortions, but is associated with a lower cost of debt during financial crises and for firms more likely to be distressed, when implicit government guarantees become the dominant effect. Our results are robust to controls for the endogeneity of government ownership, and we find these effects to be specific to domestic government ownership. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

<p>When firms seek to enter a new business segment, they have to decide how to best gain access to the required resources. This paper analyzes how resource relatedness influences a firm's decision between internal development and collaborative arrangement as modes of entry. We distinguish between a firm's capacity to transfer its established resources to the new segment (resource transferability) and the integration and synergistic combination of current firm resources with target segment resources in day-to-day operations (resource complementarity). Resource transferability makes entry by internal development more likely, but this effect depends on segment characteristics. Synergies from complementary resources can be exploited more easily within firm boundaries than across an alliance interface. However, certain partner characteristics can substitute in part for belonging to the same firm. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>Individuals differ in their preference for processing information on the basis of taxonomic, feature-based similarity, or thematic, relation-based similarity. These differences, which have been investigated in a recently emerging research stream in cognitive psychology, affect innovative behavior and thus constitute an important antecedent of individual performance in research and development (R&D) that has been overlooked so far in the literature on innovation management. To fill this research gap, survey and test data from the employees of a multinational information technology services firm are used to examine the relationship between thematic thinking and R&D professionals' individual performance. A moderated mediation model is applied to investigate the proposed relationships of thematic thinking and individual-level performance indicators. Results show a positive relationship between thematic thinking and innovativeness, as well as individual job performance. While the results do not support the postulated moderation of the innovativeness-job performance relationship by employees' political skill, they show that the relationship between thematic thinking and job performance is fully mediated by R&D professionals' innovativeness. The present study is thus the first to reveal a positive relationship between thematic thinking and innovative performance.</p>"

<p>This research is the first empirical attempt to calculate the various components of the hidden bias associated with the sampling strategies routinely-used in human genetics, with special reference to surname-based strategies. We reconstructed surname distributions of 26 Italian communities with different demographic features across the last six centuries (years 1447-2001). The degree of overlapping between ""reference founding core"" distributions and the distributions obtained from sampling the present day communities by probabilistic and selective methods was quantified under different conditions and models. When taking into account only one individual per surname (low kinship model), the average discrepancy was 59.5%, with a peak of 84% by random sampling. When multiple individuals per surname were considered (high kinship model), the discrepancy decreased by 8-30% at the cost of a larger variance. Criteria aimed at maximizing locally-spread patrilineages and long-term residency appeared to be affected by recent gene flows much more than expected. Selection of the more frequent family names following low kinship criteria proved to be a suitable approach only for historically stable communities. In any other case true random sampling, despite its high variance, did not return more biased estimates than other selective methods. Our results indicate that the sampling of individuals bearing historically documented surnames (founders' method) should be applied, especially when studying the male-specific genome, to prevent an over-stratification of ancient and recent genetic components that heavily biases inferences and statistics.</p>"

Those integrals are defined through the Kakutani isometric identification of X with a C(K) space.

Using an innovative methodological framework that combines lab-in-the-field experiments with survey interviews and complete social networks data, the article goes beyond the assessment of a relationship between social networks and collective outcomes to study the mechanisms that favor cooperative behavior. The article first establishes a positive relationship between position in the network structure and propensity to cooperate in the producer organization and then uses farmers' behavior in dictator and public goods games to test different mechanisms that may account for such a relationship. Results show that cooperation is induced by patterns of reciprocity that emerge through repeated interaction rather than other-regarding preferences like altruism or group solidarity.</p>"

<p>The control and eventual elimination of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) requires the expansion of current control and surveillance activities. A systematic review of the published literature on the costs of HAT prevention, treatment, and control, in addition to the economic burden, was conducted. All studies that contained primary or secondary data on costs of prevention, treatment and control were considered, resulting in the inclusion of 42 papers. The geographically focal nature of the disease and a lack of standardization in the cost data limit the usefulness of the available information for making generalizations across diverse settings. More recent information on the costs of treatment and control interventions for HAT is needed to provide accurate information for analyses and planning.

<p>Local governments are increasingly adopting road pricing schemes to curb pollution and congestion in the cities.

The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of road pricing on traffic flows by means of a synthetic control approach which allows for a wide heterogeneity of treatment effects. By using a large sample of 75 types of vehicles entering the centre of Milan between 2008 and 2012, we evaluate the enforcement of the road pricing scheme occurred in January 2012 across 20 types of vehicles. We have found a large variation in the reaction of traffic flows and a significant effect in terms of vehicles reduction after pricing for cars and for some types of commercial vehicles.

<p>Backgrounds and aims: Despite recent advances in medical therapies for inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], little is known about their impact on inpatient management. Our objectives were to explore hospitalisation and surgery trends for all IBD patients in Italy at three time points over 7 years.</p>
<p>Methods: National hospital discharge records were retrospectively reviewed for all admissions with a Crohn's disease [CD, 555*] or ulcerative colitis [UC, 556*] diagnosis in 2005, 2008, and 2011. Quantitative variables [mean, standard deviation] and categorical variables [frequencies] were described; comparison among admission-years was made by analysis of variance and chi-square tests. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of surgery risk regarding demographics, inpatient management, and clinical features; p-values <= 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>
<p>Results: Overall, 109 657 hospitalisations occurred over the 3 years, with a decreasing trend observed in UC admissions. Mean age was higher in UC [50.1 +/- 19.7] than in CD [43.2 +/- 21.9]. The number of paediatric admissions rose from 3637 to 4372 between 2005 and 2011. An increasing proportion of CD [from 12.4% to 14.6%] and UC [from 5.8% to 8.0%] admissions reported a digestive system-related, surgical diagnosis-related group in the same period; overall, gastrointestinal surgical admissions increased from 3299 to 3964. In regression analysis, male gender, age, admission year, northern university hospital, disease localisation, and cancer as independent factors significantly affected the likelihood of surgery.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Despite a reduction in total IBD hospitalisations, surgical and paediatric admissions rose over time. Further study is needed to clarify benefits associated with new drugs in terms of inpatient management.</p>"

<p>We study the effects of managerial practices in schools on student outcomes. We measure managerial practices using the World Management Survey, a methodology that enables us to construct robust measures of management quality comparable across countries. We find substantial heterogeneity in managerial practices across six industrialized countries, with more centralized systems (Italy and Germany) lagging behind the more autonomous systems (Canada, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States). For Italy, we are able to match organizational practices at the school level with student outcomes in a math-standardized test. We find that managerial practices are positively related to student outcomes. The estimates imply that if Italy had the same managerial practices as the United Kingdom (the best performer), it would close the gap in the math OECD PISA test with respect to the OECD average. We argue that our results are robust to selection issues and show that they are confirmed by a set of IV estimates and by a large number of robustness checks. Overall, our results suggest that policies directed at improving student cognitive achievements should take into account principals selection and training in terms of managerial capabilities.</p>"

This paper examines whether this finding holds for longer investment horizons over which the optimising strategy exploits linear predictability in returns. Our experiments indicate that investors with longer horizons on average would have benefited, ex post, from an optimising strategy over the period 1995-2009.

<p>We present new survey evidence on pricing behavior for more than 14,000 European firms, and study its macroeconomic implications. Among firms that are price setters, roughly 75% respond that their prices are set as a markup on total costs, a business practice termed ""full cost pricing"". Only 25% set prices as markups over variable or marginal costs. Moreover, using industry data for the U.S., we find that the correlation between changes in output prices and changes in variable input prices is significantly lower when fixed costs are likely to be more important.</p>
<p>Since our results are similar to the findings in the classic and controversial paper of Hall and Hitch (1939) and subsequent survey evidence, we believe it worth studying the implications of full cost pricing for macroeconomics. We first propose a problem for the firm where full cost pricing can arise as optimizing behavior. We embed this problem, featuring an occasionally binding constraint, into a simple general equilibrium model. We show that when the model is hit by a shock that makes the constraint binding, the response of endogenous variables is amplified significantly more than it would be under the unconstrained regime.

To this end, we adopted a geographical difference-in-discontinuities approach, which allowed us to control for area specific factors and to identify the effect of road pricing at the boundary of the treated area.

<p>Bonnie Honig has recently criticized the attempt to graft ethical and political principles onto the alleged universality of suffering. She considers this trend inhospitable to vigorous, democratic citizenship, and she pits a 'lamentational politics' centered on suffering and mortality against a political, agonistic humanism that focuses on life, action and courage. In this article, I inquire into how political action in concert can (and does) arise out of suffering. I characterize suffering, following Karl Jaspers, as a situation that defines being human. Yet, drawing on Jaspers and Camus, I resist its portrayal as immediately universal and anti-political. First, I transpose suffering from the plane of singular, idiosyncratic experience to that of complex situation. Second, by way of my reading of The Plague, I suggest that suffering can be privileged ground for the reconfiguration of political landscapes through its unmaking of identities in both a literal and metaphoric sense. Suffering ought not to be displaced from debates in political theory. Rather, it should become an agonistic ground of contention. It should be re-politicized.</p>"

<p>Three main motivations can explain compliance with social norms: fear of peer punishment, the desire for others' esteem and the desire to meet others' expectations. Though all play a role, only the desire to meet others' expectations can sustain compliance when neither public nor private monitoring is possible. Theoretical models have shown that such desire can indeed sustain social norms, but empirical evidence is lacking. Moreover it is unclear whether this desire ranges over others' ""empirical"" or ""normative"" expectations. We propose a new experimental design to isolate this motivation and to investigate what kind of expectations people are inclined to meet. Results indicate that, when nobody can assign either material or immaterial sanctions, the perceived legitimacy of others' normative expectations can motivate a significant number of people to comply with costly social norms.</p>"

<p>Platforms have evolved beyond just being organized as multi-sided markets with complementors selling to users. Complementors are often unpaid, working outside of a price system and driven by heterogeneous sources of motivationwhich should affect how they respond to platform growth. Does reliance on network effects and strategies to attract large numbers of complementors remain advisable in such contexts? We test hypotheses related to these issues using data from 85 online multi-player game platforms with unpaid complementors. We find that complementor development responds to platform growth even without sales incentives, but that attracting complementors has a net zero effect on on-going development and fails to stimulate network effects. We discuss conditions under which a strategy of using unpaid crowd complementors remains advantageous. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>Introduction: Proposed diagnostic criteria (international working group and National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) include markers of amyloidosis (abnormal cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] amyloid beta [A beta]42) and neurodegeneration (hippocampal atrophy, temporo-parietal hypometabolism on [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and abnormal CSF tau). We aim to compare the accuracy of these biomarkers, individually and in combination, in predicting AD among mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients.</p>
<p>Methods: In 73 MCI patients, followed to ascertain AD progression, markers were measured. Sensitivity and specificity, positive (LR+) and negative (LR-) likelihood ratios, and crude and adjusted hazard ratios were computed.</p>
<p>Results: Twenty-nine MCI patients progressed and 44 remained stable. Positivity to any marker achieved the lowest LR- (0.0), whereas the combination A beta 42 plus FDG-PET achieved the highest LR+ (6.45). In a survival analysis, positivity to any marker was associated with 100% conversion rate, whereas negativity to all markers was associated with 100% stability.</p>

<p>Long-run and sustainable development is a main source of concern for contemporary cities. To address this issue, strategic plans have been introduced in several cities. In this paper, we investigate the determinants of strategic plan adoption in Italian cities by relying on the institutional collective action theory which predicts that collaboration among institutions is more likely to occur in areas with larger social capital stock and where public bodies share a common history of collaboration. Our econometric evidence shows that a larger stock of social capital and a history of past institutional collaboration increases the probability of adopting a strategic plan, confirming the central prediction of the institutional collective action theory.</p>"

<p>In recent years, the concept of responsiveness has been put forward as one desirable measure of the performance of health systems. Responsiveness can be defined as a system's ability to respond to the legitimate expectations of potential users regarding non-health enhancing aspects of care. However, since responsiveness is evaluated by patients on a categorical scale, their self-evaluation can be affected by the phenomenon of reporting heterogeneity. A few studies have investigated how standard socio-demographic characteristics influence the reporting style of patients with regard to responsiveness. However, we are not aware of studies that focus explicitly on the influence that both the patients' state of health and their experiencing of pain have on their reporting style on responsiveness. This paper tries to bridge this gap by using data regarding a sample of about 2500 patients hospitalized in four Local Health Authorities (LHA) in Italy's Emilia-Romagna region between 2010 and 2012. These patients have evaluated 27 different aspects of the quality of care, concerning five domains of responsiveness (communication, privacy, dignity, waiting times and quality of facilities). Data have been stratified into five subsamples, according to these domains. We estimate a generalized ordered probit model, an extension of the standard ordered probit model which permits the reporting behaviour of respondents to be modelled as a function of certain respondents' characteristics, which in our analysis are represented by the variables ""state of health"" and ""pain"". Our results suggest that unhealthier patients and patients experiencing pain are more likely to report a lower level of responsiveness, all other things being equal. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>This article analyses the dynamics of business groups (BG) formation and diffusion in Italy in the twentieth century. It shows that BGs is not an organisational form which characterizes only developing countries or economies in their very early stage of development. Indeed, in its evolution from a peripheral country to one of the most advanced economies, Italy has been constantly populated by BGs. One striking feature of the Italian corporate system is that BGs are present not only among large firms, but also in almost all the other forms of enterprise: cooperative firms, municipalised companies, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and fast-growing medium-sized firms. Thus, BG seems to be the only way to grow' for Italian firms or, at least, the easiest way to reach a reasonable size. BG as a governance system looks particularly flexible, adapting itself to different ownership, market conditions and local contexts. In absence of obstacles of legal or fiscal nature, this flexibility is probably the main reason for its resilience.</p>"

<p>We study the adoption of different patterns of intangible asset (IA) accumulation in manufacturing firms. Contrary to most of the previous literature, we find such patterns to be highly differentiated. In particular, we identify three types of firm behaviour: high and persistent, low and persistent, and discontinuous. We link the capability-based view of the firm to theories of asset complementarities and market signalling to explain how firm-specific traits affect such behaviours. We obtain the following results: first, the persistent accumulation of IAs is favoured by the internal availability of highly skilled personnel; second, firms with (a) large IA base and (b) high propensity to exploit complementarities in the asset stocks are more likely to persistently accumulate IAs than to discontinuously or never accumulate IAs and third, the adoption of quality management standards facilitates the accumulation of IAs, especially if this is done discontinuously. This paper adds to the previous literature in two ways: first, it highlights the existence of great heterogeneity in the dynamics of IA accumulation and, second, it provides an explanation for such heterogeneity.</p>"

To the extent expected returns have a common component spanning related firms, a risk-based explanation would suggest a stronger negative relation between accruals and future firm performance when related firms are also growing. Instead, the attenuation we document is more likely attributable to suboptimal investment decisions, which the stock market and analysts do not incorporate in a timely manner.</p>"

<p>The solution of several operations research problems requires the creation of a quantitative model. Sensitivity analysis is a crucial step in the model building and result communication process. Through sensitivity analysis we gain essential insights on model behavior, on its structure and on its response to changes in the model inputs. Several interrogations are possible and several sensitivity analysis methods have been developed, giving rise to a vast and growing literature. We present an overview of available methods, structuring them into local and global methods. For local methods, we discuss Tornado diagrams, one way sensitivity functions, differentiation-based methods and scenario decomposition through finite change sensitivity indices, providing a unified view of the associated sensitivity measures. We then analyze global sensitivity methods, first discussing screening methods such as sequential bifurcation and the Morris method. We then address variance-based, moment-independent and value of information-based sensitivity methods. We discuss their formalization in a common rationale and present recent results that permit the estimation of global sensitivity measures by post-processing the sample generated by a traditional Monte Carlo simulation. We then investigate in detail the methodological issues concerning the crucial step of correctly interpreting the results of a sensitivity analysis. A classical example is worked out to illustrate some of the approaches.

<p>ObjectivesThe literature typically undervalues the economy-wide importance of confidence, despite a renewed interest since the recent financial crisis in considering also psychological factors such as confidence. This study empirically assesses whether confidence matters for current real GDP growth in the euro area and the United States in addition to a widely applied and reliable predictor, the Purchasing Managers' Index.</p>
<p>MethodsWe add confidence indicators to a regression of real GDP growth on the composite PMI output index and check for a different impact of confidence during recessions as opposed to expansions by applying smooth transition regressions.</p>
<p>ResultsConfidence matters for economic growth, both in good and bad times. This result is robust across sample periods, models, and proxies for confidence.</p>
<p>ConclusionsConfidence is essential for assessing the current stage of the business cycle. Analysts should therefore closely monitor sentiment swings, whereas private and public decisionmakers can boost growth by improving confidence in the economy.</p>"

<p>We examine the structure and dynamics of network of scientific international collaborations within North Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt) using both publishing and patent data. Results show that the region has undergone a sustained process of internationalization, which has translated in both an expansion of the network of scientific collaborations and a relative increase in the research output of international teams. At the same time we find the existence of a very limited degree of scientific integration at the regional level, i.e. within Northern Africa. Among the countries examined, Egypt seems to be the most active one in terms of size of research output as well as number and variety of international collaborations. Moreover, Egypt is the most central node of the regional research network and this centrality has considerably grown over time. This increased importance of Egypt as regional research hub is associated with a remarkable increase in the centrality of Saudi Arabia within Egypt's research network. This holds across a variety of research fields as well as in terms of applied science (as shown by patent data). Overall, these results suggest that the region is undergoing a deep transformation in the structure and composition of scientific collaborations.</p>"

<p>Objective</p>
<p>This research sought to assess whether and to what extent the ongoing economic crisis in Italy impacted hospitalizations, in-hospital mortality and expenditures associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>The data were obtained from the hospital discharge database of the Italian Health Ministry and aggregated at the hospital level. Each hospital (n = 549) was observed for 4 years and was geographically located within a ""Sistema Locale del Lavoro"" (SLL, i.e., clusters of neighboring towns with a common economic structure). For each SLL, the intensity of the crisis was determined, defined as the 2012-2008 increase in the area-specific unemployment rate. A difference-in-differences (DiD) approach was employed to compare the increases in AMI-related outcomes across different quintiles of crisis intensity.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Hospitals located in areas with the highest intensity of crisis (in the fifth quintile) had an increase of approximately 30 AMI cases annually (approximately 13%) compared with hospitals in area with lower crisis intensities (p<0.001). A significant increase in total hospital days was observed (13%, p<0.001) in addition to in-hospital mortality (17%, p<0.001). As a consequence, an increase of around (sci)350.000 was incurred in annual hospital expenditures for AMI (approximately 36%, p<0.001).</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>More attention should be given to the increase in health needs associated with the financial crisis. Policies aimed to contrast unemployment in the community by keeping and reintegrating workers in jobs could also have positive impacts on adverse health outcomes, especially in areas of high crisis intensity.</p>"

Our model explains how a firm can start from a dominant position in one of the existing markets and exploit switching costs and compatibility to enter a new market. Mergers and acquisitions also play an important role as the new market is pioneered by a start-up, which is soon acquired by the dominant incumbent. As a result of the acquisition, the acquiring firm becomes the leader also in the new market.</p>"

<p>The economic crisis, the growing healthcare demand, and Defensive Medicine wastefulness, strongly recommend the restructuring of the entire medical network. New health technology, such as bedside ultrasonography, might successfully integrate the clinical approach optimizing the use of limited resources, especially in a person-oriented vision of medicine. Bedside ultrasonography is a safe and reliable technique, with worldwide expanding employment in various clinical settings, being considered as ""the stethoscope of the 21st century"". However, at present, bedside ultrasonography lacks economic analysis. We performed a Cost-Benefit Analysis ""ex ante"", with a break-even point computing, of bedside ultrasonography implementation in an Internal Medicine department in the mid-term. Number and kind estimation of bedside ultrasonographic studies were obtained by a retrospective study, whose data results were applied to the next 3-year period (foresight study). All 1980 foreseen bedside examinations, with prevailing multiorgan ultrasonographic studies, were considered to calculate direct and indirect costs, while specific and generic revenues were considered only after the first semester. Physician professional training, equipment purchase and working time represented the main fixed and variable cost items. DRG increase/appropriateness, hospitalization stay shortening and reduction of traditional ultrasonography examination requests mainly impacted on calculated revenues. The break-even point, i.e. the volume of activity at which revenues exactly equal total incurred costs, was calculated to be 734 US examinations, corresponding to a,not sign 81,998 and the time considered necessary to reach it resulting 406 days. Our economic analysis clearly shows that bedside ultrasonography implementation in clinical daily management of an Internal Medicine department can produce consistent savings, or economic profit according to managerial choices (i.e., considering public or private targets), other than evident medical benefits.</p>"

<p>We study the Bayesian problem of sequential testing of two simple hypotheses about the parameter alpha > 0 of a Levy gamma process. The initial optimal stopping problem is reduced to a free-boundary problem where, at the unknown boundary points separating the stopping and continuation set, the principles of the smooth and/or continuous fit hold and the unknown value function satisfies on the continuation set a linear integro-differential equation. Due to the form of the Levy measure of a gamma process, determining the solution of this equation and the boundaries is not an easy task. Hence, instead of solving the problem analytically, we use a collocation technique: the value function is replaced by a truncated series of polynomials with unknown coefficients that, together with the boundary points, are determined by forcing the series to satisfy the boundary conditions and, at fixed points, the integro-differential equation. The proposed numerical technique is employed in well-understood problems to assess its efficiency.</p>"

Forecasts from the time varying FAVAR model are more accurate, in particular over the global financial crisis period, than forecasts from other benchmark models. Finally, we use the time varying FAVAR model to assess how monetary transmission to the economy has changed.</p>"

<p>The paper develops a method for producing current quarter forecasts of gross domestic product growth with a (possibly large) range of available within-the-quarter monthly observations of economic indicators, such as employment and industrial production, and financial indicators, such as stock prices and interest rates. In light of existing evidence of time variation in the variances of shocks to gross domestic product, we consider versions of the model with both constant variances and stochastic volatility. We use Bayesian methods to estimate the model, to facilitate providing shrinkage on the (possibly large) set of model parameters and conveniently generate predictive densities. We provide results on the accuracy of nowcasts of realtime gross domestic product growth in the USA from 1985 through 2011. In terms of point forecasts, our proposal improves significantly on auto-regressive models and performs comparably with survey forecasts. In addition, it provides reliable density forecasts, for which the stochastic volatility specification is quite useful.</p>"

<p>Theoretical research on public-private partnerships has emphasised their ability to address agency problems in infrastructure projects. Despite this, there is a substantial body of empirical research which documents the tendency of such projects to create budgetary problems for the state authorities involved. This article seeks to explore how and why these problems occur through case studies of PPP hospital projects in England and Italy. It shows how features of the PPP approach encourage and facilitate strategic behaviour by state employees during financial appraisals, and provides evidence that this has undermined the quality of investment decisions and given rise to contractual structures which have failed to minimise the long-run costs to the government. It hypothesises that the PPP approach encourages the commissioning of unaffordable projects, and suggests that future research should focus on the financial appraisal process to identify the political and organisational pressures that are particularly salient in this process and to further evaluate the outcomes.</p>"

<p>We study the dividend policy of firms in regulated network industries, focusing on the impact of different regulatory regimes and government control. We link payout and smoothing decisions to different regulatory mechanisms (cost-based vs. incentive regulation) and state versus private ownership. We test our predictions on a panel of listed European electric utilities, accounting for potential endogeneity of the choice of regulatory and ownership patterns. We find that incentive-regulated firms smooth their dividends less than cost-based regulated firms and that they report higher target payout ratios. Consistent with the interest group theory of regulation, we find that incentive regulation schemes are less likely when the state is still an important shareholder in the sector. Additionally, our results show that government control undermines the efficiency-enhancing effects of incentive regulation on dividend policy, for example, lower smoothing is only due to private firms.

<p>In a model with bankruptcy costs and segmented deposit and equity markets, we endogenize the cost of equity and deposit finance for banks. Despite risk neutrality, equity capital earns a higher expected return than direct investment in risky assets. Banks hold positive capital to reduce bankruptcy costs, but there is a role for capital regulation when deposits are insured. Banks could no longer use capital when they lend to firms instead of investing directly in risky assets. This depends on whether the firms are public and compete with banks for equity capital or are private with exogenous amounts of capital. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>In academia, as well in the industry, there is currently an increasing interest in the concept of smart tourism destinations. Specifically, there is widespread recognition of the role that ICTs, the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing play in providing instruments and platforms to facilitate the dissemination of information and knowledge among stakeholders, thus enhancing innovation and destination competitiveness. Despite that, not much research exists that aims at understanding the processes of information and knowledge transfer, sharing, and conversion in smart tourism destinations. This paper seeks to deepen the scientific debate around this topic by applying a network analytic approach to the cases of three tourism destinations. Findings reveal that effective knowledge-based destination management studies should consider both the virtual and the real components of the network structure of the destination.

<p>Firms are increasingly launching initiatives with explicit social mandates. The business case for these often relies on one critical aspect of human capital management: employee retention. Although prior empirical studies have demonstrated a link between corporate social initiatives and intermediate employee-related outcomes such as motivation and identification with the firm, their relationship with final retention outcomes has not been investigated. Our study fills this gap. Using individual-level data for approximately 10,000 employees in a global management consulting firm, we present empirical evidence of a positive retention effect associated with employee participation in a corporate initiative with explicit social impact goals. In addition, we offer arguments for moderating conditions that weaken this relationship and present evidence consistent with our arguments. Further econometric analysis based on a stringent matching approach as well as additional analyses based on survey and interview data suggest that the retention effect can at least partly be attributed to treatment and is not all just a manifestation of sorting of certain types of employees into the social initiative. Overall, by demonstrating a positive association between social initiative participation and employee retention, this study highlights the need for further research into how corporate social engagement can serve as a tool for strategic human capital management.</p>"

<p>We investigate parameter heterogeneity in breast cancer 1-year cumulative hospital costs across five European countries as part of the EuroHOPE project. The paper aims to explore whether conditional mean effects provide a suitable representation of the national variation in hospital costs. A cohort of patients with a primary diagnosis of invasive breast cancer (ICD-9 codes 174 and ICD-10 C50 codes) is derived using routinely collected individual breast cancer data from Finland, the metropolitan area of Turin (Italy), Norway, Scotland and Sweden. Conditional mean effects are estimated by ordinary least squares for each country, and quantile regressions are used to explore heterogeneity across the conditional quantile distribution. Point estimates based on conditional mean effects provide a good approximation of treatment response for some key demographic and diagnostic specific variables (e.g. age and ICD-10 diagnosis) across the conditional quantile distribution. For many policy variables of interest, however, there is considerable evidence of parameter heterogeneity that is concealed if decisions are based solely on conditional mean results. The use of quantile regression methods reinforce the need to consider beyond an average effect given the greater recognition that breast cancer is a complex disease reflecting patient heterogeneity.

<p>Using patient-level data for cerebral infarction cases in 2007, gathered from Finland, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Scotland and Sweden, we studied the variation in risk-adjusted length of stay (LoS) of acute hospital care and 1-year mortality, both within and between countries. In addition, we analysed the variance of LoS and associations of selected regional-level factors with LoS and 1-year mortality after cerebral infarction. The data show that LoS distributions are surprisingly different across countries and that there is significant deviation in the risk-adjusted regional-level LoS in all of the countries studied. We used negative binomial regression to model the individual-level LoS, and random intercept models and ordinary least squares regression for the regional-level analysis of risk-adjusted LoS, variance of LoS, 1-year risk-adjusted mortality and crude mortality for a period of 31-365 days. The observed variations between regions and countries in both LoS and mortality were not fully explained by either patient-level or regional-level factors. The results indicate that there may exist potential for efficiency gains in acute hospital care of cerebral infarction and that healthcare managers could learn from best practices.

The observed variations were largely explained by country-specific effects rather than by regional-level factors. The results show that there should still be room for efficiency gains in the acute treatment of hip fracture, and clinicians, healthcare managers, and politicians should learn from best practices. This study demonstrates that an international comparison of acute hospital care is possible using pooled individual-level administrative data. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>The EuroHOPE very low birth weight and very low for gestational age infants study aimed to measure and explain variation in mortality and length of stay (LoS) in the populations of seven European nations (Finland, Hungary, Italy (only the province of Rome), the Netherlands, Norway, Scotland and Sweden). Data were linked from birth, hospital discharge and mortality registries. For each infant basic clinical and demographic information, infant mortality and LoS at 1year were retrieved. In addition, socio-economic variables at the regional level were used. Results based on 16087 infants confirm that gestational age and Apgar score at 5min are important determinants of both mortality and LoS. In most countries, infants admitted or transferred to third-level hospitals showed lower probability of death and longer LoS. In the meta-analyses, the combined estimates show that being male, multiple births, presence of malformations, per capita income and low population density are significant risk factors for death. It is essential that national policies improve the quality of administrative datasets and address systemic problems in assigning identification numbers at birth. European policy should aim at improving the comparability of data across jurisdictions. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) on acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients have increased substantially in the last 12-15years because of its clinical effectiveness. The expansion of PCI treatment for AMI patients raises two questions: How did PCI utilization rates vary across European regions, and which healthcare system and regional characteristic variables correlated with the utilization rate? Were the differences in use of PCI associated with differences in outcome, operationalized as 30-day mortality? We obtained our results from a dataset based on the administrative information systems of the populations of seven European countries. PCI rates were highest in the Netherlands, followed by Sweden and Hungary. The probability of receiving PCI was highest in regions with their own PCI facilities and in healthcare systems with activity-based reimbursement systems. Thirty-day mortality rates differed considerably between the countries with the highest rates in Hungary, Scotland, and Finland. Mortality was lowest in Sweden and Norway. The associations between PCI and mortality were remarkable in all age groups and across most countries. Despite extensive risk adjustment, we interpret the associations both as effects of selection and treatments. We observed a lower effect of PCI in the higher age groups in Hungary.

<p>Purpose - The variety and change of organization forms in the agri-business industry are analyzed, extending available comparative economic organization approach (most notably transaction cost economics) with negotiation analysis and organization design theory. The paper aims to discuss these issues.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - Three extensions are proposed and argued to be particularly useful for analyzing economic organization in conditions such as those prevailing in agri-food industries. First, more consideration is given to horizontal structures and associational contracts as a particularly important response to transactional problems in this field. Second, it is acknowledged that different conditions of substitutability in different stages of the chain make it likely that transaction costs are different for different parties, bringing them to have different preferences over governance solutions, whereby a negotiation problem on efficient arrangements has to be solved. Third, the very process of integrating different parties' interests contributes in explaining the emergence of ""hybrids"" and in designing more efficient and more fair forms within the (very) large class of hybrids, and even within any sub-type of hybrid, such as sub-contracting, licensing, franchising, consortia, etc.</p>
<p>Findings - New Pareto-improving and Nash-improving solutions are specified, and shown to provide indications for organizational change that differ from those predicted and prescribed by standard organizational economics. Those solutions are also shown to be realistic (possible in reality) through case studies on actual non-main-stream experiences approximating those arrangements. Both the analytic method proposed, and the solutions found, provide useful and currently missing tools to private and public policy makers for improving the organization of the sector.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - The study specify pre-conditions for reaching superior agreements, that suggest hypotheses for empirical further research on the factors that may favor or hinder those changes.</p>
<p>Practical implications - A ""trend"" for change is recommended for the agri-food sector, toward more associational and horizontal arrangements, rather than either toward market or hierarchical governance or any hybrid intermediate point between them. It has been shown that this prescription should hold not only across stages of the value chain, but also among firms within the same stage (in the case, the farming stage).</p>
<p>Social implications - The proposed changes should improve the fairness of economic organization in the sector. Re-equilibrating negotiation power is an alternative way of reducing transaction costs across stages and a pre-condition for reaching more efficient and fair agreements across stages.</p>
<p>Originality/value - Both the analytic method proposed, and the solutions found, extend economic organization theory, and provide useful and curre"

<p>Powerful, centralized states controlling a large share of national income only begin to appear in Europe after 1500. We build a model that explains their emergence in response to the increasing importance of money for military success. When fiscal resources are not crucial for winning wars, the threat of external conflict stifles state-building. As finance becomes critical, internally cohesive states invest in state capacity while divided states rationally drop out of the competition, causing divergence. We emphasize the role of the ""Military Revolution"", a sequence of technological innovations that transformed armed conflict. Using data from 374 battles, we investigate empirically both the importance of money for military success and patterns of state-building in early modern Europe. The evidence is consistent with the predictions of our model.</p>"

<p>This article applies mechanism design to the study of international conflict resolution. Standard mechanisms in which an arbitrator can enforce her decisions are usually not feasible because disputants are sovereign entities. Nevertheless, we find that this limitation is inconsequential. Despite only being capable of making unenforceable recommendations, mediators can be equally effective as arbitrators. By using recommendation strategies that do not reveal that one player is weak to a strong opponent, a mediator can effectively circumvent the unenforceability constraint. This is because these strategies make the strong player agree to recommendations that yield the same payoff as arbitration in expectation. This result relies on the capability of mediators to collect confidential information from the disputants, before making their recommendations. Simple protocols of unmediated communication cannot achieve the same level of ex ante welfare, as they preclude confidentiality.</p>"

<p>We analyze the link between virtual water trade, that is, the flow of water embodied in the international trade of agricultural goods, and vulnerability to external shocks from the vantage point of network analysis. While a large body of work has shown that virtual water trade can enhance water saving on a global scale, being especially beneficial to arid countries, there are increasing concerns that openness makes countries more dependent on foreign food suppliers and, in this way, more prone to external shocks. Our evidence reveals that the increased globalization witnessed in the last three decades is not associated with the increased frequency of adverse shocks (in food production). Furthermore, building on recent advances in network analysis that connect the stability of a complex system to its topological features, we find that the world is more interconnected, but not necessarily less stable.

<p>Many governments make use of private finance contracts to deliver healthcare infrastructure. Previous work has shown that the rate of return to investors in these markets often exceeds the efficient level. Our focus is on the factors that influence that return. We examine the effect of macroeconomic, project- and firm-level variables using a detailed sample of 84 UK private finance initiative (PFI) contracts signed between 1997 and 2010. Of the above variables, macroeconomic conditions and lead sponsor size are related to the investor return. However, our results show a remarkable degree of stability in the return to investors over the 14-year period. We find evidence of a 'prevailing norm' that is robust to project- and firm-level variation. The sustainability of excess returns over a long period is indicative of a concentrated market structure. We argue that policymakers should consider new mechanisms for increasing competition in the equity market, while ensuring that authorities have the specialist resources required to negotiate efficient contract prices.

<p>This paper tests the commonly-used assumption that people apply a single discount rate to the utility from different sources of consumption. Using survey data from Uganda with both hypothetical and incentivized choices over different goods, we elicit time preferences from about 2400 subjects. We reject the null of equal discount rates across goods: the average person in our sample is more impatient about sugar, meat and starchy plantains than about money and a list of other goods. We review the assumptions to recover discount rates from experimental choices for the case of good-specific discounting. Consistently with the theoretical framework, we find convergence in discount rates across goods for two groups expected to engage in or think about arbitraging the rewards: traders and individuals with large quantities of the good at home. As an application, we evaluate empirically the conditions under which good-specific discounting could predict a low-asset poverty trap. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Context: The process of care for patients with prostate cancer is subject to different degrees of uncertainty. Patients and clinicians could, therefore, greatly benefit from improved prognostic instruments. One emerging tool is the cell cycle progression (CCP) score.</p>
<p>Objective: This systematic review assesses evidence on the value of the CCP instrument in prostate cancer treatment by reviewing current publications and integrating the results via a meta-analysis.</p>
<p>Evidence acquisition: We performed a review of Medline and Embase in April 2014, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA). Unpublished studies were retrieved from the 2013-2014 proceedings of major conferences in the field. Sixteen publications were selected for inclusion.</p>
<p>Evidence synthesis: The results show that use of the CCP score is better than existing assessments at elucidating the aggressive potential of prostate cancer in an individual. The pooled hazard ratio for biochemical recurrence per 1-unit increase in the CCP score was 1.88 in a univariate model and 1.63 in a multivariate model. Four studies showed that CCP testing can impact the decisions of physicians regarding treatment, and potentially lead to a decrease in surgical interventions for low-risk patients.</p>
<p>Conclusions: This review offers a comprehensive overview of existing evidence on CCP testing, and provides clinicians, patients, and policy makers with a strong summary measure of its prognostic validity and clinical utility. It will be important to develop economic studies to measure the impact of such technology on health care systems.</p>
<p>Patient summary: In this paper, we review current evidence related to the cell cycle progression (CCP) score for patients with prostate cancer. We found good evidence suggesting that use of the CCP score improves prognosis, and can be a valuable tool for clinicians in treating patients. The economic benefits are yet to be studied.

<p>Building on existing theories of fertility dynamics, this article provides a theoretical perspective that connects two recent strands of the literature. The first concerns gender equity and equality where institutions play a critical role. The second is that subjective well-being matters in explaining childbearing behaviour (and vice versa). Our key argument is that subjective well-being is a direct function of the discrepancy between aspirations and attainment, here interpreted as a potential mismatch between gender equity and equality. As aspirations change over time, discrepancy arises in so far institutions are unable to follow suit with new emerging preferences. This lowers subjective well-being associated with childbearing, and hence leads to lower levels of fertility. Our empirical analysis is based on the European Social Survey, and although taking an indirect approach, we provide support for this idea. Fertility and happiness are higher where institutions appear to have adapted to women's new preferences and aspirations, which is further supported by strong gender differences in happiness associated with parenthood. Fathers are always happier than non-fathers-no matter the circumstances of the country where they reside-whereas mothers are happier only when relevant institutions are in place.</p>"

<p>Far from reopening classic debates on EU modes of governance, this special issue uses the governance notion as an organizing concept in order to examine the governing of the EU in times of crisis.

A systematic investigation is not possible given the limitation on space, but this introductory article highlights some of the aspects that we consider have been at the heart of the new political challenges to the EU. Our main hypothesis is that the 2008 crisis has offered a new opportunity for the intergovernmental mode of decision-making to prevail, left marginal space for further including citizens in decision-making processes and has provided a very narrow definition of effectiveness. This change of context calls for a re-examination of forms of governing in the EU, and more specifically the so-called 'softening narrative', in order to go beyond a mere distinction between 'hard' and 'soft' law and focus more on the governing processes that are in place in various institutional and policy areas.</p>"

<p>The aim of the paper is to investigate the main determinants of the bilateral virtual water (water used in the production of a commodity or service) flows associated with international trade in agricultural goods across the Mediterranean basin. We consider the bilateral gross flows of virtual water in the area and study what export-specific and import-specific factors are significantly associated with virtual water flows. We follow a sequential approach. Through a gravity model of trade, we obtain a ""refined"" version of the variable we aim to explain, one that is free of the amount of flows due to pair-specific factors affecting bilateral trade flows and that fully reflects the impact of country-specific determinants of virtual water trade. A number of country-specific potential explanatory variables, ranging from water endowments to trade barriers, from per capita GDP to irrigation prices, is presented and tested. To identify the variables that help to explain the bilateral flows of virtual water, we adopt a model selection procedure based on model averaging. Our findings confirm one of the main controversial results in the literature: larger water endowments do not necessarily lead to a larger 'export' of virtual water, as one could expect We also find some evidence that higher water irrigation prices reduce (increase) virtual water 'exports' ('imports').

Model uncertainty arises because decision makers may not know this mechanism. Two types of uncertainty result, a state uncertainty within models and a model uncertainty across them. We discuss some two-stage static decision criteria proposed in the literature that address state uncertainty in the first stage and model uncertainty in the second (by considering subjective probabilities over models). We consider two approaches to the Ellsberg-type phenomena characteristic of such decision problems: a Bayesian approach based on the distinction between subjective attitudes toward the two kinds of uncertainty; and a non-Bayesian approach that permits multiple subjective probabilities.

<p>Environmental Management Systems (EMSs) implemented according to the ISO14001 standard have been examined by many authors, especially focussing on its impact at the firm level. However only a few papers have investigated the impact of ISO14001 from a country perspective. This paper aims to contribute to bridging this gap. The aim is to study the relation between ISO14001 growth and the trend in selected macro-economic and development indexes. By applying the Growth Mixture Model to a panel of 73 countries for the period 1999-2012, we assess the following hypotheses: (a) the increase in numbers of ISO14001 certifications corresponds to an increase in economic indexes; (b) the increase in ISO14001 corresponds to an increase in development indexes; (c) the trends of ISO14001 adoption and macro-economic indexes confirm the relationship described by the Environmental Kuznets Curve.</p>
<p>The results confirm a positive relation among the trends of some variables such as ISO14001 and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), ISO14001 and industry value added while no significant results were found when observing the relation between ISO14001 and the selected development indexes. In addition, using the industry added value as the variable to measure economic development, our results support the theory of the Environmental Kuznets Curve. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>The relevance of ideas is at the core of the IB field and has been captured in concepts like technology, innovation and knowledge. While these concepts have evolved over the last decades, the point that the ideas and the international connectivity are central for IB remains genuine. This paper is an attempt to take stock of the evolution of the concepts technology, innovation and knowledge in IB literature along the past five decades with a particular focus on the role of the Columbia Journal of World Business (CJWB) and the Journal of World Business (JWB) in this evolution. Likewise, our objective is to offer a research agenda for the coming decade. We proceed in two steps. First, we scrutinize how the IB literature has progressed and expanded over the last five decades, illustrating this on the basis of articles published in CJWB and JWB. Second, we take a helicopter view on this literature and reflect on the insights we have gained and the challenges the IB field has ahead that can constitute the basis for a future research agenda. We highlight the importance of creating a micro-foundation of knowledge processes where mechanisms on the interaction between the higher levels (nation, firm, teams) and the individual level are clarified.

<p>This study explores strategic awareness and its implications for strategic planning in public organizations. The expectation is that better awareness of emergent strategies is the basis of effective strategic thinking and planning. An action research study was performed at the Municipality of Milan. The results highlight some relevant drivers promoting strategic awareness: (i) a mindset change from an internal view to an external needs coverage analysis, (ii) the use of horizontal staff involvement to avoid responsibility issues in a structured strategic thinking process and (iii) total disclosure within a window of opportunity' to show the structural impossibility of reaching universal coverage.</p>"

<p>We analyze political selection in a closed list proportional system where parties have strong gate-keeping power, which they use as an instrument to pursue votes. Parties face a trade-off between selecting loyal candidates or experts, who are highly valued by the voters and thus increase the probability of winning the election. Voters can be rational or behavioral. The former cares about the quality mix of the elected candidates in the winning party, and hence about the ordering on the party list The latter only concentrate on the quality type of the candidates in the top positions of the party list Our theoretical model shows that, to persuade rational voters, parties optimally allocate loyalists to safe seats and experts to uncertain positions. Persuading behavioral voters instead requires to position the experts visibly on top of the electoral list. Our empirical analysis, which uses data from the 2013 National election in Italy held under closed list proportional representation and from independent pre-electoral polls, is overall supportive of voters' rational behavior. Loyalists (i.e., party officers or former members of Parliament who mostly voted along party lines) are overrepresented in safe positions, and, within both safe and uncertain positions, they are ranked higher in the list (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

<p>We examine gender differences among the six PhD student cohorts 2004-2009 at the California Institute of Technology using a new dataset that includes information on trainees and their advisors and enables us to construct detailed measures of teams at the advisor level. We focus on the relationship between graduate student publications and: (1) their gender; (2) the gender of the advisor, (3) the gender pairing between the advisor and the student and (4) the gender composition of the team. We find that female graduate students coauthor on average 8.5% fewer papers than men; that students writing with female advisors publish 7.7% more. Of particular note is that gender pairing matters: male students working with female advisors publish 10.0% more than male students working with male advisors; women students working with male advisors publish 8.5% less. There is no difference between the publishing patterns of male students working with male advisors and female students working with female advisors. The results persist and are magnified when we focus on the quality of the published articles, as measured by average Impact Factor, instead of number of articles. We find no evidence that the number of publications relates to the gender composition of the team. Although the gender effects are reasonably modest, past research on processes of positive feedback and cumulative advantage suggest that the difference will grow, not shrink, over the careers of these recent cohorts.</p>"

<p>As ""green public procurement"" (GPP) is playing an increasingly important role in stimulating the demand for environmentally friendly products and services, there is a strongly emerging need to analyze which factors drive the inclusion of environmental criteria in public tenders. Working on data from Italian municipalities, our statistical analysis confirmed that intensifying information and raising awareness on GPP techniques can strongly support the development of public green tenders. Moreover, our work reveals that good GPP performance cannot be achieved through the mere adoption of a certified Environmental Management System (EMS) by a public authority alone, but rather through the level of maturity of the certified EMS that provides a growing ""value added"" to GPP practices. Finally, findings of this study demonstrate that the relevant limitations linked to the small size of public authorities can be overcome by the progress in GPP brought by several European, national and local supporting initiatives.

<p>Biofuels represent a promising alternative to substitute fossil fuels and, given the relevance of environmental impacts of the transport sector, policy initiatives worldwide aim at supporting the shift towards such cleaner energy source. Acknowledging the crucial role that biofuels will play in years to come in the energetic paradigm, the study aims at investigating key-determinants of drivers' willingness to pay for biofuels, focusing on a sample of 260 individuals from Northern Italy (n = 260). In line with recent research on consumer behavior, socio-demographics are not good predictors of drivers' willingness to pay. Surprisingly, on the other hand, knowledge of the topic is negatively correlated to willingness to pay, so that the more people know about biofuels, the less they are willing to pay a premium price. Moreover, certification is not an effective tool to convince drivers of the eco-friendliness of biofuels, hence spurring willingness to pay. Possible explanations of the research findings as well as policy implications are discussed in detail, along with suggestions for future research on the topic. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>We study the relationship between corporate governance and firms' environmental innovation. Exploiting changes in antitakeover legislation in the US, we show that worse governed firms generate fewer green patents relative to all their innovations. This negative effect is greater for firms with a smaller share of institutional ownership, with a smaller stock of green patents, and with more binding financial constraints. Investigating regulatory and industry variations, we also find more pronounced effects for firms operating in states with lower pollution abatement costs, and in sectors less dependent on energy inputs. Overall, our results suggest that ineffective corporate governance may constitute a major obstacle to environmental efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>The strategic HRM literature suggests that HRM influences employees in combinations of practices that ""fit"" each other rather than as stand-alone practices; however, it pays little attention to the underlying individual-level mechanisms. In contrast, the HRM literature on knowledge sharing examines the influence of single practices on individual-level knowledge sharing, but fails to include the influence of combinations of practices. We link the idea of fit between practices to employee motivation for knowledge sharing by arguing that rewards may be ambiguous and difficult to interpret, but that such ambiguity may be reduced if rewards are combined with other aligned HRM practices, notably job design and work climate. Thus, fit is established through the ambiguity-reducing effect of combining specific HRM practices. Accordingly, we test for complementarities among rewards, job design, and work climate in the form of a three-way interaction among these variables with respect to their impact on knowledge-sharing motivation. Our analysis of 1,523 employees in five knowledge-intensive firms shows that employees who are exposed to knowledge-sharing rewards experience higher levels of autonomous motivation to share when they are simultaneously exposed to a noncontrolling job design and work climate that support knowledge sharing.

Surprisingly, announcement of sovereign negative credit watches results in increased bank stock returns. Bank share price losses following sovereign downgrades increase as bank leverage, efficiency, and equity performance increase, and they decrease as bank systematic risk and payout ratio increase. On the contrary, bank share prices rise following sovereign negative credit watches, as leverage and bank size decrease and as bank systematic risk increases.</p>"

<p>We develop a tractable method to estimate multiple prior models of decision-making under ambiguity. In a representative sample of the U.S. population, we measure ambiguity attitudes in the gain and loss domains. We find that ambiguity aversion is common for uncertain events of moderate to high likelihood involving gains, but ambiguity seeking prevails for low likelihoods and for losses. We show that choices made under ambiguity in the gain domain are best explained by the alpha-MaxMin model, with one parameter measuring ambiguity aversion (ambiguity preferences) and a second parameter quantifying the perceived degree of ambiguity (perceptions about ambiguity). The ambiguity aversion parameter a is constant and prior probability sets are asymmetric for low and high likelihood events. The data reject several other models, such as MaxMin and MaxMax, as well as symmetric probability intervals. Ambiguity aversion and the perceived degree of ambiguity are both higher for men and for the college-educated. Ambiguity aversion (but not perceived ambiguity) is also positively related to risk aversion. In the loss domain, we find evidence of reflection, implying that ambiguity aversion for gains tends to reverse into ambiguity seeking for losses. Our model's estimates for preferences and perceptions about ambiguity can be used to analyze the economic and financial implications of such preferences.</p>"

We identify robust results concerning the incentives of different nations to commit themselves to a climate agreement and estimate the extent of greenhouse gas mitigation that can be achieved by stable agreements. We also assess the potential of transfers that redistribute the surplus of cooperation to foster the stability of climate coalitions. In contrast to much of the existing analytical game theoretical literature, we find substantial scope for self-enforcing climate coalitions in most models that close much of the abatement and welfare gap between complete absence of cooperation and full cooperation. This more positive message follows from the use of appropriate transfer schemes that are designed to counteract free riding incentives.</p>"

<p>We analyze risk allocation and contractual choices when public procurement is plagued with moral hazard, private information on exogenous shocks, and threat of corruption. Complete contracts entail state-contingent clauses that compensate the contractor for shocks unrelated to his own effort. By improving insurance, those contracts reduce the agency cost of moral hazard. When the contractor has private information on revenues shocks, verifying messages on shocks realizations is costly. Incomplete contracts do not specify state-contingent clauses, thereby saving on verifiability costs. This makes incomplete contracts attractive even though they entail greater agency costs. Because of private information on contracting costs, a public official may have discretion to choose whether to procure under a complete or an incomplete contract. When the public official is corrupt, such delegation results in incomplete contracts being chosen too often. Empirical predictions on the use of incomplete contracts and policy implications on the benefits of standardized contracts are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Science Parks are complex institutions that aim at promoting innovation and entrepreneurship at local level. Their activities entertain a large set of stakeholders going from internal and external researchers to entrepreneurs, local level public administration and universities. As a consequence, their performances extends on a large set of dimensions affecting each other. This feature makes Science Parks particularly difficult to be properly compared. However, evaluating their performances in a comparable way may be important for at least three reasons: (1) to identify best practices in each activity and allow a faster diffusion of these practices, (2) to inform potential entrepreneurs about institutions better supporting start-ups birth and first stages and (3) to guide public policies in the distribution of funds and incentives. The multidimensional nature of Science Parks raises the problem of aggregating performances in simple indexes that can be accessed by stakeholders willing to compare different structures on the basis of their own preferences. This paper exploits a new dataset on Italian Science Parks to provide a pilot study towards this direction. In particular, we apply Choquet integral based Multi-Attribute Value Theory to elicit stakeholders' preferences on different dimensions of Science Parks' performances and construct a robust index allowing to rank them. This tool can be used to support the decision making process of multiple stakeholders looking for best (or worst) performers and allows to account both for subjective nature of the evaluation process and the interactions among decision attributes. Despite the present study employs only a limited number of respondents and performance measures, the procedure we present can be straightforwardly adapted to much richer environments.</p>"

<p>Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce an alternative novel approach to measurement of customer perceptions of the service experience that links closely with customer loyalty outcomes.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper draws upon prior theory and empirical research to investigate the relevance of using relative metrics compared to absolute metrics in service research.</p>
<p>Findings - The findings upon which this paper draws upon show that measuring customer satisfaction, likelihood to recommend, brand preference using absolute metrics explain a very small per cent of the variance in key customer outcome measures such as share of wallet. Instead, a relative approach to these and other measures in service research is proposed.</p>
<p>Practical implications - Although business practice has embraced relative measurement much more extensively than has scientific research, the vast majority of customer experience measurement programs today continue to employ absolute measures resulting in suboptimal allocation of firm resources. This paper is a call to rethink these current measurement practices.</p>

<p>This study examines how R&D investment is shaped by governance devices. Combining the two agency models of limited competence and managerial opportunism, it suggests that governance devices exert differing effects, in early vs. later stages of CEO tenure. Early in CEO tenure, R&D investment is reduced by stock options and board independence, whereas in later stages these effects reverse: R&D investment is enhanced by stock options and board independence. An empirical test on a sample of U.S. companies provides support for the hypothesized effects. For policy makers, this study implies that R&D investment can be enhanced by setting rules and standards of good governance that take into account CEO time in office and firm context.

<p>Objective: To perform a systematic literature review on the implant rates of pacemakers, cardioverter-defibrillators, and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices in Europe over the last decade to provide insight into the possible reasons for differences across regions or countries.</p>
<p>Methods: Four electronic databases were searched to find studies describing CIED implant rates in Europe. Fifty-eight studies were included.</p>
<p>Results: An overview showed a recent rise in CIED implants, with large geographic differences. The ratio between the regions with the highest and lowest implant rates within the same country ranged between 1.3 and 3.4 for pacemakers and between 1.7 and 44.0 for defibrillators. The ratio between the countries with the highest and lowest implant rates ranged between 23 and 87.5 for pacemakers, between 3.1 and 1548.0 for defibrillators, and between 4.1 and 221.0 for resynchronization therapy devices. Implant rate variability appears to be influenced by health care, economic, demographic, and cultural factors.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Publications on CIED implant rates in Europe show a wide variability within and across countries, the determinants of which are only partially investigated. Policy making should improve regarding equity of access to better care. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This paper adopts a contingency approach to the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and seeks to establish boundary conditions for the value of certain information technology (IT) capabilities. We first identify inter-organizational alliances as a specific strategy context in which IT capabilities are particularly valuable. We then consider more detailed boundary conditions that can shape the value of these capabilities within the alliance context. Our study shows that firms with better IT capabilities can derive greater value from an alliance, yet this effect also varies across different types of alliances depending on an individual alliance's characteristics. Specifically, IT capabilities are more valuable for alliances with a non-equity governance structure, as well as those involving a high degree of interdependence between partners. We highlight the implications of our findings for opportunities to advance the RBV.</p>"

<p>Background: The study aims at investigating the characteristics and the satisfaction determinants of the emerging patient profile. This profile appears to be more demanding and ""empowered"" compared to the ones traditionally conceived, asking for unconventional healthcare services and for a closer relationship with providers.</p>
<p>Methods: Both qualitative (semi-structured interviews and focus groups) and quantitative (survey) analyses were performed on a random sample of 2808 Italian citizens-patients. Analyses entailed descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis and linear regressions.</p>
<p>Results: Four relevant dimensions of patient 2.0 experience were identified through a literature review on experiential marketing in healthcare. Beta coefficients exhibited the effect that different healthcare experiential elements have on patient 2.0 satisfaction.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Results allow to state that a new marketing approach, based on patient 2.0 characteristics and value drivers, should be adopted in the healthcare sector. Critical satisfaction drivers and new technological healthcare guidelines are identified in order to match the new patient profile needs.</p>"

<p>Purpose - Adopting a knowledge-based perspective, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the roll-out process of lean production systems and explores the dimensions that might enhance or hinder its performance. It develops a framework to understand and design lean roll-out processes, identifying the research dimensions/design variables to classify and interpret such processes.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - This exploratory multiple case study analyses seven lean roll-out processes in multinational companies' plants. An original data set, developed on the basis of a purposely design research protocol, was built through two rounds of plant visits and structured interviews. The cross-case analysis compares and contrasts the lean roll-out processes according to the research dimensions constituting the framework.</p>
<p>Findings - The effectiveness and the efficiency of the lean roll-out processes: first, negatively co-vary with the degree of lean knowledge codification; second, positively co-vary with the degree of autonomy of the plant; third, positively co-vary with the degree of contextual ambidexterity. Moreover, lean roll-out processes characterized by principles-based knowledge replication strategy, plant autonomy and contextual ambidexterity are comparatively more effective and efficient.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - This is an exploratory qualitative study that develops propositions potentially testable in larger scale, more analytical research.</p>
<p>Practical implications - This study provides a tentative roadmap to successfully approach the roll-out of lean production systems in complex organizations.</p>
<p>Originality/value - This study challenges the current theory and practice which implicitly assumes that lean roll-outs take place linearly, cascading a set of predefined lean operations practices. Instead, the authors show that a less codified, more decentralized and contextually ambidextrous approach might be more effective.</p>"

<p>The Great Crisis has highlighted the importance of establishing macro prudential architectures to address problems of financial stability. Central banks are always part of macro prudential settings, but their role is far from being homogeneous across countries, reflecting the fact that according to economic theory there are pros and cons in extending central bank influence to macro prudential supervision. The issue is then genuinely empirical: are there any meaningful drivers explaining the actual choices made by policymakers about the central bank's role in macro prudential governance?</p>
<p>We identify three potential drivers - micro supervision involvement, monetary policy discretion, overall institutional independence - and test for their relevance, by analysing current institutional settings in 31 advanced and emerging market economies. We find that central bankers already in charge of micro supervision and less politically independent are more likely to get extended macro prudential powers; the same is true, if they have low monetary policy discretion, being constrained by a monetary stability objective. We interpret these results by using a political economy perspective. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This chapter discusses the practical challenges and opportunities involved in merging the two fields of cognitive neurosciences and strategic management, starting from the premise that the need to marry them is justified by their complementarities, as opposed to the level of analysis on which they both focus. We discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of using methods borrowed from cognitive neurosciences for management research. First, we argue that there are clear advantages in deploying techniques that enable researchers to observe processes and variables that are central to management research, with the caveat that neuroscientific methods and techniques are not general-purpose technologies. Second, we identify three core issues that specify the boundaries within which management scholars can usefully deploy such methods. Third, we propose a possible research agenda with various areas of synergy between the complementary capabilities of management and neuroscience scholars, aiming to generate valuable knowledge and insight for both disciplines and also for society as a whole.</p>"

<p>Using micro data from Duke University quarterly survey of Chief Financial Officers, we show that corporate investment plans as well as actual investment are well explained by CFOs' expectations of earnings growth. The information in expectations data is not subsumed by traditional variables, such as Tobin's Q or discount rates. We also show that errors in CFO expectations of earnings growth are predictable from past earnings and other data, pointing to extrapolative structure of expectations and suggesting that expectations may not be rational. This evidence, like earlier findings in finance, points to the usefulness of data on actual expectations for understanding economic behavior.</p>"

<p>Background Iron deficiency is very common in a number of medical conditions. Ferric carboxymaltose is a new stable iron preparation that can be administered in single infusions over short periods of time. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the efficacy and safety of the novel complex compared with other iron formulations. In addition, the feasibility of a network meta-analysis for indirect comparisons was investigated.</p>
<p>Methods A systematic literature review was performed for published RCTs on the use of ferric carboxymaltose in iron deficiency between July and October 2014. Indirect comparisons were also addressed using terms referring to competing iron formulations. We further supported the qualitative results of the systematic review by a network meta-analysis that allows pooling the evidence around different intervention outcomes in the absence of trials involving a direct comparison.</p>
<p>Results The initial search yielded 1027 citations, which was decreased to 21 studies eligible for inclusion in the review. Studies were heterogeneous in the number of patients randomised, iron deficiency-related conditions addressed, trial inclusion criteria, time horizon, treatment dosage and outcomes assessed. Six studies with the same time horizon (i.e. 6 weeks) were included in the network meta-analysis. Considering the differences between final and initial outcome values for each iron formulation, the mean difference of these differences (delta) was estimated for each couple of treatments involving ferric carboxymaltose. Significant improvements in serum ferritin (A mu g/l) were obtained with ferric carboxymaltose compared to oral iron (delta 172.8; 95 % CI 66.7-234.4) and in haemoglobin (g/dl) with respect to ferric gluconate (delta 0.6; 95 % CI 0.2-0.9), oral iron (delta 0.8; 95 % CI 0.6-0.9) and placebo (delta 2.1; 95 % CI 1.2-3.0).</p>
<p>Conclusions All currently available intravenous iron preparations appear to be safe and effective, but ferric carboxymaltose seems to provide a better and quicker correction of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels in iron-deficient patients.</p>"

<p>The life cycle assessment (LCA) framework has established itself as the leading tool for the assessment of the environmental impact of products. Several works have established the need of integrating the LCA and risk analysis methodologies, due to the several common aspects. One of the ways to reach such integration is through guaranteeing that uncertainties in LCA modeling are carefully treated. It has been claimed that more attention should be paid to quantifying the uncertainties present in the various phases of LCA. Though the topic has been attracting increasing attention of practitioners and experts in LCA, there is still a lack of understanding and a limited use of the available statistical tools. In this work, we introduce a protocol to conduct global sensitivity analysis in LCA. The article focuses on the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), and particularly on the relevance of global techniques for the development of trustable impact assessment models. We use a novel characterization model developed for the quantification of the impacts of noise on humans as a test case. We show that global SA is fundamental to guarantee that the modeler has a complete understanding of: (i) the structure of the model and (ii) the importance of uncertain model inputs and the interaction among them.</p>"

<p>Suppose a group of agents submit strict linear orderings over a set of alternatives. An aggregation rule is a function mapping this information into a unique social ordering. In a recent paper, Bossert and Sprumont (2014) introduced betweenness-based notions of efficiency and strategyproofness for aggregation rules and identified three broad classes of rules which satisfy them. The current paper suggests that such betweenness-based requirements may at times be too weak and introduces stronger concepts based on Kemeny distances, namely K-efficiency and K-strategyproofness. When there are three alternatives, all Condorcet-Kemeny rules are both K-efficient and K-strategyproof for a large subdomain of profiles. Moreover, all status-quo rules are K-strategyproof, though not K-efficient. When the number of alternatives exceeds three none of the rules discussed by Bossert and Sprumont satisfies K-strategyproofness, while just Condorcet-Kemenyrules satisfy K-efficiency. The existence of a nondictatorial and onto K-strategyproof rule is an open question. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>The performance of firms depends not just on the structure of the industries in which they compete but also on their relative positioning within those industries, in terms of operating within particular niches. We propose that demand for these niches depends endogenously on the historical ecology of the products offered: Niches become saturatedreduced in their ability to support productsas a large number of previous offerings allows the audience to satisfy its desire for products of a particular type. Analyzing the survival rates of television series aired in the United States from 1946 to 2003, we found that the survival rates of future entrants fell with the extensiveness of recent offerings in the niche, and that the negative association between crowding and survival also weakened with this saturation.

Using data on inventor citations and inventor collaborations, changes in geographical patterns of knowledge flows between European regions during the period 1981-2000 are analysed. It is shown that inventor collaborations become less geographically localized, while inventor citations become more localized. The European integration process has a significant effect on reducing barriers to knowledge flows between new and old European Union members. For inventor citations, this effect relates only to the European Union enlargement of 1995 and is confined to knowledge flows from Austria, Finland and Sweden to old European Union members.

<p>Background: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a particularly distressing event for oncology patients. This review aims at analyzing the impact of CINV on Health-Related Quality of Life (QoL) and on the use of healthcare resources.</p>
<p>Methods: A systematic search was conducted according to the PRISMA statement on MEDLINE, EMBASE and NHS EED.</p>
<p>Results: Sixty-seven studies were included in the final selection. Despite the availability of numerous treatment options, CINV was found to have a strong impact on HRQoL of patients. Direct costs are particularly affected, but this result could be due to scarcity of studies assessing indirect costs.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Evidence supports the notion that CINV continues to have a negative impact on HRQoL of patients, even for those receiving moderately emetic chemotherapy. Further studies need also to collect data on the cost of CINV, particularly indirect costs, to ensure that decisions on use of healthcare resources are better supported.

<p>Introduction: Chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (CID) diminishes physical performance, raises anxiety and depression levels, and increases healthcare resource utilization.</p>
<p>Objective: To understand the impact that CID has on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and on healthcare resource utilization.</p>
<p>Methods: Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, DARE, and the NHS EED databases.</p>
<p>Results: A total of 22 articles were retrieved for full review (n = 17, HRQoL; n = 5 healthcare resource utilization). Only 2 studies had assessed HRQoL in patients experiencing CID, while cost studies demonstrated that CID episodes are unnecessarily expensive and can be avoided if diagnosed and treated early.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Better management of CID has the potential to reduce overall economic burden and improve patients' HRQoL. Available evidence also relays the need to conduct larger studies that assess HRQoL and consider cost beyond direct medical costs in order to understand the full impact of CID on HRQoL and healthcare resource utilization.

<p>Research Question/Issue: Governments worldwide bestow orders of merit upon their citizens as a recognition of distinguished service. In this paper, I study whether orders of merit can function as an external form of perquisite through which the government can supplement the compensation given by a publicly listed firm to the CEO.</p>
<p>Research Findings/Insights: I build upon the literature on perquisites to develop hypotheses on the relationship between orders of merit and executive compensation. The predictions are tested through an empirical analysis that revolves around the 1974 legal reform in which Sweden discontinued the conferral of orders of merit to citizens. The difference-in-differences methodology I employ enables me to make causal statements on the relationship between orders of merit, firm performance, and monetary compensation. I find that orders of merit function as symbols that visibly confirm social status vis-a-vis the general public and are valued by CEOs as a substitute for the need to engage in conspicuous consumption.</p>
<p>Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical support that orders of merit can be seen as an external form of perquisite that can substitute for monetary compensation. Essentially, this is evidence that governments can affect CEO salaries through the provision of a non-monetary status good. The findings also indicate that CEOs not only care about distinguishing themselves as ""superstars"" among their peer group of corporate leaders but also value non-monetary symbols that emphasize their social status in relation to the general public.</p>
<p>Practitioner/Policy Implications: Companies should take into account that CEOs may receive valuable status goods from the government when determining compensation policies. In addition, governments should consider that the removal of nonmonetary awards may result in higher levels of monetary compensation in publicly listed firms.</p>"

<p>We analyze the Bayesian formulation of the sequential testing of two simple hypotheses for the distributional characteristics of an inverse Gaussian process. This problem arises when we are willing to test the positive drift of an unobservable Brownian motion, for which only the first passage times over positive thresholds can be recorded. We show that the initial optimal stopping problem for the posterior probability of one of the hypotheses can be reduced to a free-boundary problem, whose unknown boundary points are characterized by the principles of the continuous or smooth fit and whose unknown value function solves a linear integro-differential equation over the continuation set. A numerical scheme, based on the collocation method for boundary value problems, is further illustrated, in order to get precise approximations of the free-boundary problem solution, which seems to be very hard to derive analytically, because of the particular structure of the Levy measure of an inverse Gaussian process.</p>"

<p>Page and Quintana (2016) introduce the novel methodology of spatial product partition models in order to explicitly model the partitioning of spatial locations, with the aim of balancing local and global spatial dependence. Here we first discuss Gibbs-type partitions and their connection to exchangeable product partition models and their possible use as building blocks of spatial product partition models. Then, adopting the viewpoint of extreme value theory, we focus on two approaches for modeling spatial extremes, namely hierarchical modeling based on a latent stochastic process and modeling based on max-stable processes. Additional insights and interesting findings may arise by developing the approach of Page and Quintana (2016) along these lines.</p>"

<p>In the theory of psychological games it is assumed that players' preferences on material consequences depend on endogenous beliefs. Most of the applications of this theoretical framework assume that the psychological utility functions representing such preferences are common knowledge. However, this is often unrealistic. In particular, it cannot be true in experimental games where players are subjects drawn at random from a population. Therefore, an incomplete-information methodology is needed. We take a first step in this direction, focusing on guilt aversion in the Trust Game. In our models, agents have heterogeneous belief hierarchies. We characterize equilibria where trust occurs with positive probability. Our analysis illustrates the incomplete-information approach to psychological games and can help to organize experimental results in the Trust Game.</p>"

<p>In this paper, we investigate the role of trust in supply forecast signalling in a supply chain with a supplier and a manufacturer in a one-shot game. It is assumed that the supplier faces a random yield uncertainty that is multiplied by the manufacturer's order quantity. The supplier has a private forecast of yield risk. Based on the information, the supplier decides whether to share its forecast truthfully, or not to share. On the other hand, the manufacturer is faced with two ordering strategies. If it trusts the supplier's report, then it updates its belief on the yield risk providing a forecast signal by the supplier. Otherwise, it orders based on its prior belief. We analytically obtain the optimal order quantity where the random yield uncertainty follows uniform distribution. The intuitive result indicates that the supplier has a tendency to deviate from reporting true forecast information. The numerical results support the intuitive conclusion.</p>"

<p>Background: Investigators conducting randomized clinical trials often explore treatment effect heterogeneity to assess whether treatment efficacy varies according to patient characteristics. Identifying heterogeneity is central to making informed personalized healthcare decisions. Treatment effect heterogeneity can be investigated using subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot (STEPP), a non-parametric graphical approach that constructs overlapping patient subpopulations with varying values of a characteristic. Procedures for statistical testing using subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot when the endpoint of interest is survival remain an area of active investigation.</p>
<p>Methods: A STEPP analysis was used to explore patterns of absolute and relative treatment effects for varying levels of a breast cancer biomarker, Ki-67, in the phase III Breast International Group 1-98 randomized clinical trial, comparing letrozole to tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Absolute treatment effects were measured by differences in 4-year cumulative incidence of breast cancer recurrence, while relative effects were measured by the subdistribution hazard ratio in the presence of competing risks using O-E (observed-minus-expected) methodology, an intuitive non-parametric method. While estimation of hazard ratio values based on O-E methodology has been shown, a similar development for the subdistribution hazard ratio has not. Furthermore, we observed that the subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot analysis may not produce results, even with 100 patients within each subpopulation. After further investigation through simulation studies, we observed inflation of the type I error rate of the traditional test statistic and sometimes singular variance-covariance matrix estimates that may lead to results not being produced. This is due to the lack of sufficient number of events within the subpopulations, which we refer to as instability of the subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot analysis. We introduce methodology designed to improve stability of the subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot analysis and generalize O-E methodology to the competing risks setting. Simulation studies were designed to assess the type I error rate of the tests for a variety of treatment effect measures, including subdistribution hazard ratio based on O-E estimation. This subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot methodology and standard regression modeling were used to evaluate heterogeneity of Ki-67 in the Breast International Group 1-98 randomized clinical trial.</p>
<p>Results: We introduce methodology that generalizes O-E methodology to the competing risks setting and that improves stability of the STEPP analysis by pre-specifying the number of events across subpopulations while controlling the type I error rate.

<p>This article analyzes how an iconic brand is threatened by the societal trend of anti-consumption motivated by well-being. Under scrutiny is the iconic brand Nutella that is recognized worldwide. In France, it has been linked to public debates on well-being concerns about palm oil. Approaching the phenomenon from a consumer perspective and through observational netnography, we investigate the accommodation work undertaken by Nutella lovers in reaction to anti-palm oil attacks. We identify three major accommodation processes: neutralization, interiorization, and adhesion. Each of these processes is constituted of three different practices. Our study shows that while an iconic brand can resist anti-consumption claims thanks to its brand community, such disputes can cause the brand to lose part of its strength. We suggest that anti-consumption for an iconic brand such as Nutella may thus be ambivalent.</p>"

<p>Bucrkground: We evaluated the real work! cost-effectiveness of the MitraClip system (Abbott Vascular Inc., Menlo Park, CA) plus medical therapy for patients with moderate/severe mitral regurgitation, as compared with medical therapy (MT) alone.</p>
<p>Methods: Clinical records of patients with moderate to severe functional mitral regurgitation treated with MitraClip (N 232) or with MT (N 151) were collected and outcome analyzed with propensity score adjustment to reduce selection bias. Twelve-month outcomes were modeled over a lifetime horizon to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis, in the payer's perspective. Costs and benefits were discounted at an annual rate of 3.5%.</p>
<p>Results: After propensity score adjustment, the average treatment effect was 9.5% probability of dying at 12 months and, following lifetime modeling, 3.35 +/- 0.75 incremental life years and 3.01 +/- 0.57 incremental quality -adjusted life years. MitraClip contributed to a higher decrease in re -hospitalizations at 12 months (difference 0.54 +/- 0.08) and generated a more likely improvement in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class at 12 months versus NYHA at enrollment. Incremental costs, adapted to five possible scenarios, ranged from 14,493 to 29,795 contributing to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranging from 4796 to 7908 E.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Compared to MT alone and given conventional threshold values, MitraClip can be considered a cost-effective procedure. The cost-effectiveness of MitraClip is in line or superior to the one of other non pharmaceutical strategies for heart failure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

We find that: 1) in routes with a strong presence of leisure (business) traffic, fares are set to be less (more) responsive to the time component; 2) in schedules more suitable for leisure (business) travellers, fares are set to be less (more) responsive to the capacity component.

The generosity of the program and the skill level of the unemployed agent determine the optimal policy instrument to be implemented. Restricting attention to 'soft programs' contracts that make no use of punishments or sanctions allows a fully analytical characterization of the optimal program and, in addition, it makes the solution robust to hidden saving.

<p>Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charts are widely used for the detection of small shifts as opposed to Shewhart charts, which are commonly used for the detection of large-size shifts in a process. Many interesting features of EWMA charts are available in literature mainly for complete data. This study intends to investigate the EWMA control charts under Type-I censoring for Poisson-exponential distributed lifetimes. The two commonly used sampling schemes, that is, simple random sampling and rank set sampling, are used in this study. The monitoring of mean level shifts using censored data is of a great interest in many applied problems. The idea of conditional expected values is employed in the monitoring of small mean level shifts in the current study. The performance of the EWMA charts is evaluated using the average run length extra quadratic loss and performance comparison index measures. The optimum sample-size comparisons for the specified and unspecified parameter are also part of this study. Moreover, an illustrative example and a case study for practical considerations are also discussed. It is observed that varying censoring rates affect the performance of the chart depending upon the type of sampling scheme and the amount of shifts. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>More transparent firms enjoy better access to finance, and also enable closer scrutiny by tax authorities and thus face a heavier tax burden, insofar as they are required to report the same data to tax authorities and investors (book-tax conformity). We study this trade-off in a model with distortionary taxes and finance rationing, and test its predictions on an international dataset. As predicted, firms facing low corporate tax rates choose high transparency, particularly if they are not very dependent on external funding. This result is confirmed by the evidence from statutory tax reforms: reductions of corporate tax rates are followed by increases in firm transparency. Moreover, firms choose higher transparency in countries with high audit quality. Investment is positively correlated with transparency, especially for firms more dependent on external finance. Results are stronger in countries with book-tax conformity.</p>"

Study 1 demonstrates that relative to non-negative brand names, negative brand names and their associated logos are better recognised. Studies 2 and 3 demonstrate that negative valence of a brand name tends to have a detrimental influence on product evaluation with evaluations worsening as negative valence increases. However, evaluation is also dependent on brand name arousal, with high arousal brand names resulting in more positive evaluations, such that moderately negative brand names are equally as attractive as some non-negative brand names. Study 3 shows evidence for affective habituation, whereby the effects of negative valence reduce with repeated exposures to some classes of negative brand name.</p>"

To conduct the empirical analysis we use a dataset collected with the support of the Italian energy regulatory authority, comprising micro data on monetary incentives and physical assets for the largest electricity distribution operator in Italy (86 % of the market). Our results show that physical assets and operational expenditures do affect service quality. Moreover, when we investigate causality in the relationship between incentives to quality and the use of capital and non-capital resources, we find that incentives Granger-cause capital expenditures ( and not vice-versa). Finally, our results reveal an asymmetric effect of rewards and penalties on capital expenditures' decisions across areas with different quality levels.

<p>For high-quality processes where the defect rate is very low, e.g., parts per million (ppm), time-between events (TBE) control charts have several advantages over the ordinary control charts. Most existing TBE control charts are based on the homogeneous Poisson process assumption, so that the distribution of TBE can only be exponential. However, the exponential distribution is not suitable in many applications, especially when the failure rate is not constant. In this article, we introduce a new TBE control chart, based on the renewal process, where the distribution of the TBE belongs to a parametric class of absolutely continuous distributions, which includes some well-known and commonly used lifetime distributions, i.e., exponential, Rayleigh, Weibull, Burr type XII, Pareto and Gompertz. The control structure of the proposed chart is derived analytically in general and numerical examples are presented for the Weibull distribution, due to its relevance in reliability. The performance of the proposed control charts is evaluated in terms of some standard useful measures, including average run length (ARL), the standard deviation of run length, the coefficient of variation of run length, expected quality loss (EQL) and relative ARL (RARL). The effect of parameter estimation, using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, is also discussed. This study also presents an illustrative example and four case studies to highlight the practical aspects of the new TBE chart. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This paper analyzes a two-sided market for news where two rival advertisers may pay a media outlet to conceal negative information about the quality of their own product (paying positive to avoid negative) and/or to disclose negative information about the quality of their competitor's product (paying positive to go negative). We show that competition in the product market does not necessarily prevent the emergence of commercial media bias. Whether or not competing advertisers end up having negative consequences on news accuracy ultimately depends on the extent of correlation in the quality of their products; the lower the correlation, the higher the expected accuracy of the media outlet's reports. These findings provide a rationale to explain the observed differences in the extent of commercial media bias across seemingly similar industries or products, within the same media market. The results are robust to the presence of multiple media outlets and to asymmetries between the advertisers. Overall, the paper provides theoretical insights for media regulators and for the empirical literature examining the link between advertising and news contents. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Overconfidence as predicted by low levels of Agreeableness relates to excessive trading, while high levels of Extraversion do not. Our performance prediction conditional on investor personality is that Agreeableness saves individual investors from losing money via trading, while Openness will endanger terminal wealth.

<p>In a setting where mandatory audit firm rotation has been effective for more than 20 years (i.e. Italy), we analyse changes in audit quality during the auditor engagement period. In our research setting, auditors are appointed for a three-year period and their term can be renewed twice up to a maximum of nine years. Since the auditor has incentives to be re-appointed at the end of the first and the second three-year periods, we expect audit quality to be lower in the first two three-year periods compared to the third (i.e. the last) term. Assuming that a better audit quality is associated with a higher level of accounting conservatism, and using abnormal working capital accruals as a proxy for the latter, we find that the auditor becomes more conservative in the last three-year period, i.e. the one preceding the mandatory rotation. These results are confirmed using Basu's [1997. The conservatism principle and the asymmetric timeliness of earnings. Journal of Accounting and Economics, 24(1), 3-37] timely loss recognition model. In an additional analysis, we use earnings response coefficients as a proxy for investor perception of audit quality, and we observe results consistent with an increase in audit quality perception in the last engagement period.</p>"

<p>Innovation is constantly evoked as an imperative to drive growth, however identifying an actionable and agreed upon definition that applies to different settings and purposes is not trivial. In healthcare, innovation has often been described in relation to pharmaceuticals. Defining innovation allows for proper recognition and rewarding, thus fostering present and future innovativeness in the system. Current definitions adopted by payers are focused on therapeutic added value and more specifically include clinically significant benefit, large health gains, and favorable risk-benefit balance at an acceptable cost. However, they may not be fully adequate to assess medical devices. Based on a systematic review of the academic literature in the field, we aim at summarizing acceptable definitions of innovation in relation to medical devices. Based on the innovation management and economics theory, proposed definitions have been classified according to the source of innovation, to the degree of discontinuity introduced and to the impact associated to the technology. They have also been compared with definitions adopted for drugs by main healthcare reimbursement agencies. Decision-making in healthcare often favors static allocative efficiency at the expense of incentives to innovate and obtaining valuable innovation, that is dynamic allocative efficiency. In the long run, this attitude may artificially shrink net returns from innovation and rebound on the sustainability of the healthcare systems, an undesirable consequence that a farsighted shared notion of innovation should try to prevent.

<p>Objectives To compare the clinical effectiveness of the intravesical administration of combined hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate (HA+CS) versus current standard management in adult women with recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTIs).</p>
<p>Setting A European Union-based multicentre, retrospective nested case-control study.</p>
<p>Participants 276 adult women treated for RUTIs starting from 2009 to 2013.</p>
<p>Interventions Patients treated with either intravesical administration of HA+CS or standard of care (antimicrobial/immunoactive prophylaxis/probiotics/cranberry).</p>
<p>Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was occurrence of bacteriologically confirmed recurrence within 12months. Secondary outcomes were time to recurrence, total number of recurrences, health-related quality of life and healthcare resource consumption. Crude and adjusted results for unbalanced characteristics are presented.</p>
<p>Results 181 patients treated with HA+CS and 95 patients treated with standard of care from 7 centres were included. The crude and adjusted ORs (95% CI) for the primary end point were 0.77 (0.46 to 1.28) and 0.51 (0.27 to 0.96), respectively. However, no evidence of improvement in terms of total number of recurrences (incidence rate ratio (95% CI), 0.99 (0.69 to 1.43)) or time to first recurrence was seen (HR (95% CI), 0.99 (0.61 to 1.61)). The benefit of intravesical HA+CS therapy improves when the number of instillations is 5.</p>
<p>Conclusions Our results show that bladder instillations of combined HA+CS reduce the risk of bacteriologically confirmed recurrences compared with the current standard management of RUTIs. Total incidence rates and hazard rates were instead non-significantly different between the 2 groups after adjusting for unbalanced factors. In contrast to what happens with antibiotic prophylaxis, the effectiveness of the HA+CS reinstatement therapy improves over time.</p>

<p>We investigate how resource orchestration influences performance within the 'knowledge resource management' approach by exploiting a novel database on the Italian Serie A top-professional football league spanning from the 1960-61 up to the 1991-92 season. We find that the acquisition of experience via newcomers has a U-shaped non-monotonic relationship with performance. Furthermore, we find that releasing co-specialized employees has a positive moderating role within the relationship between team experience and performance by suggesting that dismissing old routines positively influences the relationship between current routines and team's performance.

<p>In policymaking, implementation is often more critical than design. A variety of policy implementation frameworks can be used to explain implementation gaps and shifts. Each research stream suggests some solutions to prevent shortfalls. We have assessed two of these implementation strategies in the recent INHS (Italian National Health Service) retrenchment policies: (1) centralizing to rapidly cut expenditures, (2) effective management as an output- and not input-based system. The implementation of the INHS retrenchment policy has been very difficult though effective in a short period of time. A multi-level governance structure was put in place that assigned different but clear roles, powers and responsibilities to central and regional governments and public health care organizations. The entire policy was based on an exclusive input-based approach to introduce opacity in the system's prioritization processes. We most likely need to reconsider the identification of crucial implementation drivers in the public realm. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.</p>"

<p>Can firms deceive their stakeholders, by failing to deliver on their commitments to undertake sustainability practices without being detected? Extant theory posits that, due to information asymmetry, stakeholders struggle to comprehend the actual change in firms' practices. In contrast, we advance a cognitive-linguistic perspective to explain why stakeholders are sometimes misled. Accordingly, we propose that firms' deception does not appear in the content of their communication, but in its linguistic properties, which derive from how managers cognitively construe the sustainability challenge. Thus, firms cover the same points of content in their reports, but firms that practice what they preach use more complex styles of language than do firms that decouple their action from their statements. Moreover, we theorize that generalist stakeholders and stakeholders with conflicts of interest are unable to detect these linguistic nuances, whereas specialist stakeholders can. We find evidence for this cognitive-linguistic perspective in a textual analysis of grammatical structure in 261 interviews conducted in a large field study of 12 multinational corporations and their stakeholders. This lens advances our understanding of how firms deceive and how stakeholders can detect such deception and opens a new and promising avenue for research on firm-stakeholder relations.</p>"

<p>Starting from an extensive database, pooling 9 years of data from the top three insurance brokers in Italy, and containing 38125 reported claims due to alleged cases of medical malpractice, we use an inhomogeneous Poisson process to model the number of medical malpractice claims in Italy. The intensity of the process is allowed to vary over time, and it depends on a set of covariates, like the size of the hospital, the medical department and the complexity of the medical operations performed. We choose the combination medical department by hospital as the unit of analysis. Together with the number of claims, we also model the associated amounts paid by insurance companies, using a two-stage regression model. In particular, we use logistic regression for the probability that a claim is closed with a zero payment, whereas, conditionally on the fact that an amount is strictly positive, we make use of lognormal regression to model it as a function of several covariates. The model produces estimates and forecasts that are relevant to both insurance companies and hospitals, for quality assurance, service improvement and cost reduction.</p>"

<p>Purpose - Budgeting is central in public organizations. From a research viewpoint, it is an extremely multifaceted and potentially rich field to investigate and develop. The changing institutional and socio-economic landscape, moreover, requires a profound reassessment of its roles and features in accounting studies. The purpose of this paper is to review the existing European literature on public budgeting, looking at how public administration, public management, and accounting contribute to current budgeting theories and practices and to advance a proposal on how they can individually and jointly contribute in the future.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - The authors collect and analyze all the papers on public budgeting in the European context that were published in all the issues of 15 major accounting and public-management journals since 1980.</p>
<p>Findings - Budgeting has so far played a rather marginal role in European public management and accounting research. Among the existing papers, most focus on the Anglo-Saxon context, look at the intra-organizational aspects of budgeting, emphasize its managerial and allocative functions, either adopt an interpretive theoretical framework or make no explicit reference to theory, and rely on qualitative analyses. Public budgeting lies at the intersections between different disciplines and professions, but this multifacetedness has been largely neglected by the existing literature. These intersections thus offer significant opportunities for future research. Building on the distinction between the intra-and inter-organizational foci of budgeting, between its different functions (i.e. allocative, managerial, external accountability), and between the accounting and the public administration and management perspectives, the authors propose possible future research topics.</p>
<p>Originality/value - Budgeting plays a central role in public organizations and is used to allocate a large share of national incomes. This paper explores the existing literature and puts forward some potentially fruitful avenues for future research.</p>"

<p>Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to offer a reflection on the role that meta-analysis can play in theory building for service phenomena.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - The paper illustrates the benefits of conducting meta-analysis, presents its basic steps, and then uses an example to illustrate how meta-analytic findings can be used to enrich and develop theory.</p>
<p>Findings - Meta-analytic findings allow identifying gaps in current theories, thereby offering the opportunity to develop new research. Theoretical advancement through meta-analysis can imply theory borrowing, mutual theoretical development with other disciplines, intradisciplinary and multidisciplinary theorizing.</p>
<p>Practical implications - Experienced researchers might use this essay to better understand how meta-analysis can be used to generate new relevant research. Young researchers and PhD students may benefit from a greater use of meta-analysis to gain a thorough knowledge of their research topic and about the areas that require further exploration.</p>
<p>Originality/value - Rather than thinking of meta-analysis mainly as the conclusion of a well-researched domain and a good summary of cites, this essay underlines to the service scholar community how meta-analysis can boost theoretical advancement in services.</p>"

<p>Sensitivity Analysis (SA) is performed to gain fundamental insights on a system behavior that is usually reproduced by a model and to identify the most relevant input variables whose variations affect the system model functional response. For the reliability analysis of passive safety systems of Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs), models are Best Estimate (BE) Thermal Hydraulic (TH) codes, that predict the system functional response in normal and accidental conditions and, in this paper, an ensemble of three alternative invariant SA methods is innovatively set up for a SA on the TH code input variables. The ensemble aggregates the input variables raking orders provided by Pearson correlation ratio, Delta method and Beta method. The capability of the ensemble is shown on a BE-TH code of the Passive Containment Cooling System (PCCS) of an Advanced Pressurized water reactor AP1000, during a Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA), whose output probability density function (pdf) is approximated by a Finite Mixture Model (FMM), on the basis of a limited number of simulations.

<p>The role of collaboration networks within and across cities as drivers of urban creativity and new knowledge creation is increasingly acknowledged in the literature. We propose that the combination of (1) high internal social proximity between co-inventors within a city and (2) local cliques of inventors in which interaction is dense allows a city to achieve greater inventive creativity. Internal social proximity allows knowledge to circulate quickly across a larger pool of sources; dense cliques promote trust, cooperation, and a more effective use of the acquired knowledge. Moreover, social proximity between a city's inventors and inventors outside the city contributes to enriching and renewing a city's knowledge base by facilitating faster access to fresh external knowledge. We find evidence to support these propositions in a study of the inventive productivity of 331 US cities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

As theory predicts, ambiguity aversion is negatively associated with stock market participation, the fraction of financial assets in stocks, and foreign stock ownership, but it is positively related to own-company stock ownership. Conditional on stock ownership, ambiguity aversion is related to portfolio under-diversification, and during the financial crisis, ambiguity-averse respondents were more likely to sell stocks.

<p>We present a model of market competition in which consumers' attention is drawn to the products' most salient attributes. Firms compete for consumer attention via their choices of quality and price. Strategic positioning of a product affects how all other products are perceived. With this attention externality, depending on the cost of producing quality some markets exhibit ""commoditized"" price salient equilibria, while others exhibit ""de-commoditized"" quality salient equilibria. When the costs of quality change, innovation can lead to radical shifts in markets, as in the case of decommoditization of the coffee market by Starbucks. In the context of financial innovation, the model generates the phenomenon of ""reaching for yield"".</p>"

<p>The impact of varicella vaccination on the epidemiology of herpes zoster (HZ) critically depends on the mechanism of immunological boosting, through which reexposures to varicella-zoster virus are thought to reduce the individual risk of HZ development. However, the qualitative and quantitative dynamics of this process are largely unknown. Consequently, mathematical models evaluating immunization strategies need to rely on theoretical assumptions. Available varicella-zoster virus models can be classified in 3 main families according to the postulated effect of exogenous boosting: 1) progressive accumulation of immunity following repeated reexposures; 2) partial protection that wanes over time; or 3) full but temporary immunity against HZ. In this work, we review and compare quantitative predictions from the 3 modeling approaches regarding the effect of varicella immunization on HZ. All models predict a qualitatively similar, but quantitatively heterogeneous, transient increase of HZ incidence. In particular, novel estimates from the progressive immunity model predict the largest increase in natural HZ and the largest incidence of HZ cases from reactivation of the vaccine strain, which in the long term will likely outnumber prevaccination numbers. Our results reinforce the idea that a better understanding of HZ pathogenesis is required before further mass varicella immunization programs are set out.</p>"

<p>Background: On 31 December 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force rated low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer screening as level 'B' recommendation. Yet, lung cancer screening implementation remains controversial, particularly when considering its cost-effectiveness. The aim of this work is to investigate the cost-effectiveness of LDCT screening program for lung cancer by performing a systematic literature review. Methods: We reviewed the published economic evaluations of LDCT in lung cancer screening. MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science and Cochrane databases were searched for literature retrieval up to 31 March 2015. Inclusion criteria included: studies reporting an original full economic evaluation; reports presenting the outcomes as Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained or as Life Years Gained. Results: Nine economic evaluations met the inclusion criteria. All the cost-effectiveness analyses included high risk populations for lung cancer and compared the use of annual LDCT screening with no screening. Seven studies reported an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below the threshold of US$ 100 000 per QALY gained. Conclusions: Cost-effectiveness of LDCT screening for lung cancer is an highly debatable issue. Currently available economic evaluations suggest the cost-effectiveness of LDCT for lung cancer screening compared with no screening and indicate that the implementation of LDCT should be considered when planning a national lung cancer screening program. Additional economic evaluations, especially from a societal perspective and in an EU-setting, are needed.</p>"

<p>One novel implication of the open innovation paradigm is that inflows and outflows of knowledge are complementary. We argue that engaging simultaneously in buying and selling knowledge should allow firms to increase innovation outcomes. At the same time, we identify some of the relevant costs (cognitive, transaction, and organizational costs) that open firms can reduce by combining knowledge inflows and outflows. Empirically, however, we find no evidence for such complementarity in a sample of Belgian manufacturing firms. Firms buying and selling knowledge do increase their sales of new products, but at the same time their R&D costs increase more than proportionally. Our findings, therefore, indicate the need for research into a better understanding of the drivers of actual costs of organizing for open innovation. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>Culex pipiens mosquito is a species widely spread across Europe and represents a competent vector for many arboviruses such as West Nile virus (WNV), which has been recently circulating in many European countries, causing hundreds of human cases. In order to identify the main determinants of the high heterogeneity in Cx. pipiens abundance observed in Piedmont region (Northwestern Italy) among different seasons, we developed a density-dependent stochastic model that takes explicitly into account the role played by temperature, which affects both developmental and mortality rates of different life stages. The model was calibrated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach exploring the likelihood of recorded capture data gathered in the study area from 2000 to 2011; in this way, we disentangled the role played by different seasonal eco-climatic factors in shaping the vector abundance. Illustrative simulations have been performed to forecast likely changes if temperature or density-dependent inputs would change. Our analysis suggests that inter-seasonal differences in the mosquito dynamics are largely driven by different temporal patterns of temperature and seasonal-specific larval carrying capacities. Specifically, high temperatures during early spring hasten the onset of the breeding season and increase population abundance in that period, while, high temperatures during the summer can decrease population size by increasing adult mortality. Higher densities of adult mosquitoes are associated with higher larval carrying capacities, which are positively correlated with spring precipitations. Finally, an increase in larval carrying capacity is expected to proportionally increase adult mosquito abundance.</p>"

<p>Control over digital transactions has steadily risen in recent years, to an extent that puts into question the Internet's traditional openness. To investigate the origins and effects of such change, the paper formally models the historical evolution of digital control. In the model, the economy-wide features of the digital space emerge as a result of the endogenous adaptation (co-evolution) of users' preferences (culture) and platform designs (technology). The model shows that: a) in the digital economy there exist two stable cultural-technological equilibria: one with intrinsically motivated users and low control; and the other with purely extrinsically motivated users and high control; b) before the opening of the Internet to commerce, the emergence of a low-control-intrinsic-motivation equilibrium was favored by the specific set of norms and values that formed the early culture of the networked environment; and c) the opening of the Internet to commerce can indeed cause a transition to a high-control-extrinsic-motivation equilibrium, even if the latter is Pareto inferior. Although it is too early to say whether such a transition is actually taking place, these results call for a great deal of attention in evaluating policy proposals on Internet regulation.</p>"

This paper empirically investigates how young women's decisions of investing in post-secondary education are affected by labour market outcomes of older women living in the same region. EU-SILC data on educational decisions of women who completed secondary schooling are used and indicators of the regional labour market are constructed. Exploiting regional and time variability, it is found that the share of working women with young children, of women with managerial positions and the self-employed positively affect the probability to enrol. Significant effects of these variables for men are not found.</p>"

<p>In groups, member coordination is influenced by a complex set of factors including who has what knowledge (which implies who is responsible for different task domains) as well as the differing incentives associated with performing within those domains. We show that the distribution of members' expert roles interacts with the desirability of different task domains to impact member perceptions of the task, coordination, and performance. Group members who have expertise in a highly desirable domain (i.e., key experts) perceive the task differently than members who do not and report that their approach to the task is determined to a greater extent by an attention to capturing highly desirable contributions for the group than do other members. Furthermore, when a group lacks a key expert, groups divide the work involved within a highly desirable domain across multiple members. This results in the group doing well in the highly desirable domain itself, but overlooking other domains and performing poorly, overall. We discuss the theoretical implications of this research as well as its practical applications.</p>"

<p>Research Question/IssueThis article addresses the diverse and fragmented literature about the corporate governance of business groups. We collected scholarly work on the subject, proposed a conceptualization of the main research questions they addressed, classified them according to their research themes, and identified future research directions.</p>
<p>Research Findings/InsightsAcademic research on corporate governance in business groups has been increasing but is still a developing field. Available analyses make use of the main theoretical frameworks in general in corporate governance research. However, there are several areas of analysis that still need stronger conceptualization and empirical work, leaving many opportunities for future studies and a pressing need to substantiate and extend the findings of previous studies.</p>
<p>Theoretical/Academic ImplicationsOur study identifies four avenues for future research on corporate governance in business groups. This includes the examination of the complex relationships and co-evolutionary processes among corporate governance attributes and organizational and performance outcomes of business groups; the effects of ownership goals on groups' performance outcomes; the role and the actual functioning of boards inside business groups; and the analyses of cross-national comparison and long-term development of the governance of business groups.</p>
<p>Practitioner/Policy ImplicationsThis research allows practitioners and policymakers to get a better understanding of the crucial areas regarding business groups and their governance, and offers pathways to examine inside the black-box of business groups.</p>"

<p>As known, the least-squares estimator of the slope of a univariate linear model sets to zero the covariance between the regression residuals and the values of the explanatory variable. To prevent the estimation process from being influenced by outliers, which can be theoretically modelled by a heavy-tailed distribution for the error term, one can substitute covariance with some robust measures of association, for example Kendall's tau in the popular Theil-Sen estimator. In a scarcely known Italian paper, Cifarelli [(1978), La Stima del Coefficiente di Regressione Mediante l'Indice di Cograduazione di Gini', Rivista di matematica per le scienze economiche e sociali, 1, 7-38. A translation into English is available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4809 and will appear in Decisions in Economics and Finance] shows that a gain of efficiency can be obtained by using Gini's cograduation index instead of Kendall's tau. This paper introduces a new estimator, derived from another association measure recently proposed. Such a measure is strongly related to Gini's cograduation index, as they are both built to vanish in the general framework of indifference. The newly proposed estimator is shown to be unbiased and asymptotically normally distributed. Moreover, all considered estimators are compared via their asymptotic relative efficiency and a small simulation study. Finally, some indications about the performance of the considered estimators in the presence of contaminated normal data are provided.</p>"

<p>Study Design.Systematic review.Objective.This systematic review examines validity and responsiveness of three generic preference-based measures in patients with low back pain (LBP).Summary of Background Data.LBP is a very common incapacitating disease with a significant impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Health state utility values can be derived from various preference-based HRQoL instruments, and among them the most widely ones are EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D), Short Form 6 Dimensions (SF-6D), and Health Utilities Index 3 (HUI III). The ability of these instruments to reflect HRQoL has been tested in various contexts, but never for LBP populations.Methods.A systematic search on electronic literature databases was undertaken to identify studies of patients with LBP where health state utility values were reported. Records were screened using a set of predefined eligibility criteria. Data on validity (correlations and known group methods) and responsiveness (effect sizes, standardized response means, tests of statistical significance) of instruments were extracted using a customized extraction template, and assessed using predefined criteria.Results.There were substantial variations in the 37 included papers identified in relation to study design and outcome measures used. EQ-5D demonstrated good convergent validity, as it was able to distinguish between known groups. EQ-5D was also able to capture changes of health states as results of different interventions. Evidence for SF-6D and HUI III was limited to allow an appropriate evaluation.Conclusion.EQ-5D performs well in LBP population and its scores seem to be suitable for economic evaluation of LBP interventions. However, the paucity of information on the other instruments makes it impossible to determine its relative validity and responsiveness compared with them.Level of Evidence: 2</p>"

Political leaders are bound to follow policies that do not violate their country's cultural norms. This paper provides a simple positive theory and a compelling case study of the Euro area crisis to highlight the importance of cultural clashes when economies integrate.

<p>Exploiting the timing of the 2005-2006 Italian bankruptcy law reforms, we disentangle the effects of reorganization and liquidation in bankruptcy on bank financing and firm investment. A 2005 reform introduces reorganization procedures facilitating loan renegotiation. The 2006 reform subsequently strengthens creditor rights in liquidation. The first reform increases interest rates and reduces investment. The second reform reduces interest rates and spurs investment. Our results highlight the importance of identifying the distinct effects of liquidation and reorganization, as these procedures differently address the tension in bankruptcy law between the continuation of viable businesses and the preservation of repayment incentives.

<p>Recent scholarship on entrepreneurship suggests that the pre-entry know-how of start-ups, embodied in their founders, affects not only entry, but also performance. Although prior work focuses on new entrants from the focal industry (i.e., employee spinouts) and academic organizations (i.e., university spinoffs), this study identifies and examines a hybrid category of start-ups from downstream user-industries, which we call ""user-industry spinouts."" We draw from the literature on evolutionary theory, user innovation, and industrial dynamics to propose that, given the unique combination of knowledge inherited by these entrants, their choices at entry and their ability to survive in the focal industry will differ with respect to other start-ups. We do this by extending existing work on new firm creation to investigate entry and performance in different product markets. Our findings, based on a dataset of start-ups in the semiconductor industry over a 10-year period (1997-2007), show that user-industry spinouts are more likely both to enter and to survive in market-specific product categories. We suggest that the pre-entry knowledge resources of spinouts may support entry and survival across industry boundaries. However, the specific nature of these resources will influence which product markets they choose to enter. Our results have theoretical implications for the literatures on entrepreneurship, industrial dynamics, and strategy.</p>"

<p>This study investigates the effects of scientists' inbound mobility on the research performance of incumbent scientists in an academic setting. The theoretical framework integrates insights from learning theory and social comparison theory to suggest two main mechanisms behind these effects: localized learning and social comparison. The authors propose several hypotheses about the conditions that might intensify or weaken such effects. Specifically, the arrival of new scientific personnel is likely to exert stronger positive effects on the performance of incumbent scientists with shorter (cf. longer) organizational tenure; in addition, academic departments with less diversified expertise and with higher levels of internal collaborations likely reap greater benefits from learning by hiring. The empirical findings, based on a longitudinal analysis of a sample of 94 U.S. academic chemical engineering departments, provide empirical support for these contentions.</p>"

Then, the theoretical analysis is extended to the case of general rank restrictions on the VAR coefficients. Next, we describe classical and Bayesian estimation of large MAIs, and discuss methods for rank determination. Finally, the performance of the MAIs is compared with that of large Bayesian VARs in the context of Monte Carlo simulations and two empirical applications, on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and on the propagation of demand and supply shocks.

Our results indicate that relationship lending is not associated with the rent extraction mechanism deriving from informational lock-in. Conversely, market concentration appears to be associated with firms' higher cost of funding. But the effect is fully compensated if the relationship between the firm and the bank is long and comprehensive. Controlling for a number of covariates and for endogeneity concerns leaves results unchanged. Our results shed some new light on the unclear effects documented by Kysucky and Norden (2016) of relationship lending on the cost of financing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

More generally, how can public management scholars use this method to capitalize on the decades of research on other topics within our field? This study reports the findings of the first quantitative review of the public administration literature on job satisfaction. We retrieved quantitative data from primary studies published in 42 public administration journals since 1969 and performed a meta-analysis of the relationships between job satisfaction and 43 correlates. The findings include meta-analytically derived effect sizes, measures of the heterogeneity in the effect size underlying all primary studies, and several indicators of publication bias. In presenting the results of our meta-analysis, we address the merits and limitations of this methodology and discuss how public administration scholars could take full advantage of this information to advance knowledge in other areas within the field.</p>"

<p>Mitigating climate change will require innovation in energy technologies. Policy makers are faced with the question of how to promote this innovation, and whether to focus on a few technologies or to spread their bets. We present results on the extent to which public R&D might shape the future cost of energy technologies by 2030. We bring together three major expert elicitation efforts carried out by researchers at UMass Amherst, Harvard, and FEEM, covering nuclear, solar, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), bioelectricity, and biofuels. The results show experts believe that there will be cost reductions resulting from R&D and report median cost reductions around 20 % for most of the technologies at the R&D budgets considered. Although the improvements associated to solar and CCS R&D show some promise, the lack of consensus across studies, and the larger magnitude of the R&D investment involved in these technologies, calls for caution when defining what technologies would benefit the most from additional public R&D. In order to make R&D funding decisions to meet particular goals, such as mitigating climate change or improving energy security, or to estimate the social returns to R&D, policy makers need to combine the information provided in this study on cost reduction potentials with an analysis of the macroeconomic implications of these technological changes. We conclude with recommendations for future directions on energy expert elicitations.</p>"

<p>We investigate the effect of M&A on the innovation strategy of merging firms' competitors. We argue that while merging firms may reduce their commitment to innovation in the period following the deal because of an increased focus on short-term M&A implementation and financial considerations, rival firms can on the contrary exploit this moment of inertia to broaden their research and outperform rivals, producing more impactful innovations. We suggest merging firms' competitors increase the breadth of their technological search, even though this may be risky: If their attempts do not achieve the desired results, the consequences are relatively less harmful, as also their competitors are slowing down their innovation pace in the aftermath of M&A. Using data from European firms in the pharmaceutical industry, we find evidence consistent with these hypotheses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This paper examines associations among parental and adolescent health behaviors and pathways to adulthood. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we identify a set of latent classes describing pathways into adulthood and examine health-related predictors of these pathways. The identified pathways are consistent with prior research using other sources of data. Results also show that both adolescent and parental health behaviors differentiate pathways. Parental and adolescent smoking are associated with lowered probability of the higher education pathway and higher likelihood of the work and the work & family pathways (entry into the workforce soon after high school completion). Adolescent drinking is positively associated with the work pathway and the higher education pathway, but decreases the likelihood of the work & family pathway. Neither parental nor adolescent obesity are associated with any of the pathways to adulthood. When combined, parental/adolescent smoking and adolescent drinking are associated with displacement from the basic institutions of school, work, and family. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The second binary relation is an uncertainty averse preference, as defined by Cerreia-Vioglio et al. (2011c). It models the rankings that the decision maker expresses if he has to make a choice. We assume that greater than or similar to<^> is a completion of greater than or similar to*. We identify axioms under which the set of probabilities and the utility index representing greater than or similar to* are the same as those representing greater than or similar to<^>. In this way, we show that Bewley preferences and uncertainty averse preferences, two different approaches to modelling decision making under Knightian uncertainty, are complementary. As a by-product, we extend the main result of Gilboa et al. (2010), who restrict their attention to maxmin expected utility completions.</p>"

<p>Several frictions restrict the government's ability to tax assets. First, it is very costly to monitor trades on international asset markets. Second, agents can resort to nonobservable low-return assets such as cash, gold or foreign currencies if taxes on observable assets become too high. This paper shows that limitations in asset taxation have important consequences for the taxation of labor income. We study a simple dynamic moral hazard model of social insurance with observable and nonobservable saving decisions.

<p>Interpersonal trust favors the delegation of decisions and tasks within firms, allowing the expansion of more productive units. We show that this interaction between trust and firm organization contributes to shaping the pattern of comparative advantage: high-trust regions and countries exhibit larger value-added and export shares in delegation-intensive industries relative to other industries. Consistent with the idea that ""trust allows firms to expand beyond a narrow circle of family members and friends, such effects are driven by an increase in average firm size, reflecting in turn a shift of the size distribution away from the smallest firms and toward the small-to-medium ones. According to our estimates, trust is no less relevant than human or physical capital, or institutions in shaping the pattern of comparative advantage. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

<p>Despite a growing interest in the phenomenon of open innovation (OI), empirical evidence documenting the link between new product development capabilities, OI practices, and new product innovativeness is scarce. Eminent scholars have called for large-scale studies that systematically investigate the OI paradigm. Drawing on the knowledge-based view of the firm, new product development, and NPD capabilities literature streams, we conceptualize a framework in which OI practices are disentangled according to the stage of the new product development process in which they occur (development stage or commercialization stage). We identify two major types of OI practices: development-centric OI (which occurs in the development stage) and commercialization-centric OI (which occurs in the commercialization stage). Specific types of NPD capabilities-R&D, market information management, and launch-are expected to both influence the extent to which each OI practice is implemented and moderate the effect of each OI practice on product portfolio innovativeness and firm performance. The empirical analysis combines primary data from a survey of 239 firms with secondary data on innovation and financial outcomes. Our results support our hypotheses and indicate a need to differentiate among the different kinds of OI practices while elaborating on the complex role played by NPD capabilities in influencing OI practices.</p>"

<p>How well do immigrants entering the UK assimilate into recipient labour markets? Using the underexploited, sizeable and long Lifetime Labour Market Database between 1981 and 2006, we investigate the evolution of the immigrant-native earnings gap-a measure of immigrants' assimilation-across the entire earnings distribution, across cohorts and across nationalities. We are able to control for observable and unobservable individual-specific characteristics as well as for specific characteristics of both time periods and recipient labour markets, defined as small geographical areas, and crucially, for the interaction of the two, in a robust empirical model specification anchored in the human capital theory. We also control for cohort-specific effects and nationality-specific effects. Our results show little evidence of large or persistent earnings disparities across the earnings distribution, across cohorts or across nationalities. These findings are supportive evidence of successful assimilation of immigrants into the UK, suggesting that recipient labour markets primarily reward individuals' characteristics other than, and regardless of, their immigration status. Nevertheless, some distinctive features emerge. When investigating the evolution of the immigrant-native earnings gap over time, our results illustrate how immigrants from different continents and cohorts have very different assimilation trajectories.</p>"

<p>Objective: The aims of this study were (1) to investigate the relationship between clinical tests detecting spinal instability and the perceived pain and disability in nonspecific low back pain and (2) to investigate the relationship between endurance and instability tests.</p>
<p>Methods: Four instability tests (aberrant movements, active straight leg raising, prone instability test, and passive lumbar extension test) and 2 endurance tests (prone bridge test [PBT] and supine bridge test [SBT]) were performed on 101 participants. Their results were compared with the Numerical Rating Scale and the Oswestry Disability Index evaluating pain and disability, respectively.</p>
<p>Results: A low to moderate significant relationship between pain, disability, and all tests with the exception of PBT was observed.

<p>Drought is a natural hazard that can cause a wide range of impacts affecting the environment, society, and the economy. Providing an impact assessment and reducing vulnerability to these impacts for regions beyond the local scale, spanning political and sectoral boundaries, requires systematic and detailed data regarding impacts. This study presents an assessment of the diversity of drought impacts across Europe based on the European Drought Impact report Inventory (EDII), a unique research database that has collected close to 5000 impact reports from 33 European countries. The reported drought impacts were classified into major impact categories, each of which had a number of subtypes. The distribution of these categories and types was then analyzed over time, by country, across Europe and for particular drought events. The results show that impacts on agriculture and public water supply dominate the collection of drought impact reports for most countries and for all major drought events since the 1970s, while the number and relative fractions of reported impacts in other sectors can vary regionally and from event to event. The analysis also shows that reported impacts have increased over time as more media and website information has become available and environmental awareness has increased. Even though the distribution of impact categories is relatively consistent across Europe, the details of the reports show some differences. They confirm severe impacts in southern regions (particularly on agriculture and public water supply) and sector-specific impacts in central and northern regions (e.g., on forestry or energy production). The protocol developed thus enabled a new and more comprehensive view on drought impacts across Europe. Related studies have already developed statistical techniques to evaluate the link between drought indices and the categorized impacts using EDII data. The EDII is a living database and is a promising source for further research on drought impacts, vulnerabilities, and risks across Europe. A key result is the extensive variety of impacts found across Europe and its documentation. This insight can therefore inform drought policy planning at national to international levels.</p>"

<p>Modern digital systems pose new challenges to reliability analysts. Systems may exhibit a non-coherent behavior and time becomes an important element of the analysis due to aging effects. Measuring the importance of system components in a computationally efficient way becomes essential in system design. Herein, we propose a new importance measure for time-independent reliability analysis. The importance measure is based on the change in mean time to failure caused by the failure (success) of a component. It possesses some attractive properties: i) it is defined for both coherent and non-coherent systems; ii) it has an intuitive probabilistic and also geometric interpretation; iii) it is simple to evaluate. It turns out that the proposed importance measure leads naturally to a test of time consistency. We illustrate the properties with examples of coherent and non-coherent systems. A comparison with the ranking of other time-dependent and time-independent reliability importance measures is also offered. The realistic application to the reliability analysis of an H.264 video decoder concludes the work. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Background: According to current guidelines, pancreatic cancer patients should be strictly selected for surgery, either palliative or resective.</p>
<p>Methods: Population-based study, including all patients undergoing surgery for pancreatic cancer in Italy between 2010 and 2012. Hospitals were divided into five volume groups (quintiles), to search for differences among volume categories.</p>
<p>Results: There were 544 hospitals performing 10 936 pancreatic cancer operations. The probability of undergoing palliative/explorative surgery was inversely related to volume, being 24.4% in very high volume hospitals and 62.5% in very low-volume centres (adjusted OR 5.175). Contrarily, the resection rate in patients without metastases decreased from 86.9% to 46.1 % (adjusted OR 7.429). As for resections, the mortality of non-resective surgery was inversely related to volume (p < 0.001). Surprisingly, mortality of non-resective surgery was higher than that for resections (8.2% vs. 6.7%; p < 0.01). Approximately 9% of all resections were performed on patients with distant metastases, irrespective of hospital volume group. The excess cost for the National Health System from surgery overuse was estimated at 12.5 million euro.</p>
<p>Discussion.: Discrepancies between guidelines on pancreatic cancer treatment and surgical practice were observed. An overuse of surgery was detected, with serious clinical and economic consequences.</p>"

We investigate how artists engage in specific relational actions (broadening, bonding, embedding and dis-embedding) with producing organizations, and how these actions lead to innovation over time. The findings suggest that artistic innovation moves through four stages - proximal innovation, fuzzy innovation, established innovation and maintained innovation - sustained by an artist's oscillation between a network characterized by strong ties with few organizations and a network characterized by weak ties with many organizations, depending on the artist's quests for inclusion and differentiation. In this process, a long-lasting relationship between the artist and a specific organization may pivot' artistic innovation.</p>"

<p>This article explores how the similarity between a master's and former apprentice's products influences critics' evaluations of creative professionals' work. Through apprenticeships with well-known masters, creative professionals manage the competing demands for novelty and familiarity typical of creative industries and find their optimal balance. To gain positive evaluations, creative workers must demonstrate their offerings' comparability with their former master's, yet some degrees of novelty. An analysis of international haute cuisine chefs reveals an inverted U-shaped relationship between similarity of apprentice's and master's products, and critics' evaluations. Furthermore, the analysis shows that apprenticeships with high-status masters and those that occur late in the apprentice's career change this inverted U-shaped relationship into a positive one. The article concludes by highlighting the consequences of being a mainstream or a maverick with respect to the master in the creative industry and by discussing possible strategies for creative professionals to gain critics' recognition.</p>"

<p>Price transparency initiatives are typically undertaken by third parties to ensure that consumers can compare the prices of competing offers in markets in which obtaining such information is costly. Such practices have recently become widespread, yet it is unclear whether the increased price competition due to lower search costs overcomes the potential for collusion between competitors due to lower price coordination costs. Motivated by this question, the authors investigate the effect of mandatory price posting (on large electronic signs) on the pricing behavior of competing gas stations in the Italian highway system. The authors find that when prices are posted, the average price of gasoline decreases by 1 euro cent per liter, which represents about 20% of stations' margins. About half the price decrease can be attributed to the introduction of a sign posting a station's own price and those of its nearest neighbors, with the other half due to the introduction of other signs posting the prices of other stations on the same road. Despite the price reduction, however, the introduction of signs seems to have little impact on price dispersion, suggesting that price uncertainty persists even after the policy is implemented. Analysis of customer transaction data confirms this finding, showing that less than 10% of consumers use the posted price information effectively.</p>"

An original conceptual framework is developed to analyse how the logic of journalism is enacted vis-a-vis that of advertising in a setting in which an old technology for news production - print newspaper - coexists with a new one - website - and thus encounters between new and old technological possibilities make workings of institutional logics particularly visible. The findings point out different mechanisms of institutional work dealing with actions that, made possible by new technological possibilities, are potentially, but not necessarily classified as divergent from institutional logics.</p>"

<p>Despite the increasing number of music compositions by living composers, non-profit opera houses are often reluctant to include modern and contemporary operas in their repertoire. The authors consider the extent to which willingness to stage modern and contemporary operas varies with the economic and political conditions that shape the environment in which an opera house functions (i.e., demand for opera, local community openness to risk, public funding). They test their hypotheses by using panel data regression analysis to examine the programming decisions of 30 Italian opera houses over five years. The results suggest that audience pressure is a major obstacle to artistic renewal in programming. However, specific characteristics of the local community (e.g., openness to risk) moderate the negative effect of market pressures on modern and contemporary programming strategies. In addition, politicians do not counteract audience preferences for conservative artistic choices: public funding does not stimulate the programming of modern and contemporary music, and only changes in local government will increase the likelihood that an opera house will commit to artistic development of the field.</p>"

Both a store-brand chocolate (within-category substitute) and a granola bar (cross-category substitute), for example, can serve as substitutes for gourmet chocolate. Here, we found that people believe that within-category substitutes, which are more similar to desired stimuli, will more effectively satisfy their cravings than will cross-category substitutes (Experiments 1, 2a, and 2b). However, because within-category substitutes are more similar than cross-category substitutes to desired stimuli, they are more likely to evoke an unanticipated negative contrast effect. As a result, unless substitutes are equivalent in quality to the desired stimulus, cross-category substitutes more effectively satisfy cravings for the desired stimulus (Experiments 3 and 4).</p>"

<p>When establishing whether a disputed regulation is protectionist under the WTO National Treatment Principle, there are two key elements: its effect on the market for competitive products, and its intent or policy rationale. Yet the Appellate Body has formally rejected both elements, and in the surprising 2014 outcome of EC-Seal Products, under the key provision GATT Article III(4), the latter was simply denied. This obfuscation leads to implicit and explicit conflation of these elements. In some disputes, qualitative findings about the existence and nature of competitive relationships are presented using the language of quantitative market analysis. In others, compelling policy objectives shape the outcome of a supposedly market-based analysis. This article proposes an approach that synthesizes two strands of scholarship, advocating more rigorous use of market-based evidence and stronger analysis of policy rationale. Separating these elements will achieve the appropriate balance between them and lead to greater transparency in dispute outcomes.</p>"

The findings show that such conflicts matter for ICSs, hierarchical grade has stronger explanatory power than the other factors, and the higher the level in the international organization, the less frequently ICSs face conflict. The qualitative analysis explains these results by pointing to the effects of socialization among ICSs but also by shedding light on a related effect: dilution of national identity, as well as on the implications of locally recruiting lower-level staff.</p>"

<p>Fiscal rules are laws aimed at reducing the incentive to accumulate debt, and many countries adopt them to discipline local governments. Yet, their effectiveness is disputed because of commitment and enforcement problems. We study their impact applying a quasi-experimental design in Italy. In 1999, the central government imposed fiscal rules on municipal governments, and in 2001 relaxed them below 5,000 inhabitants. We exploit the before/after and discontinuous policy variation, and show that relaxing fiscal rules increases deficits and lowers taxes. The effect is larger if the mayor can be reelected, the number of parties is higher, and voters are older.</p>"

<p>In most companies, sales organizations play an increasingly strategic role in creating a competitive advantage for the firm. In contrast to marketing capabilities, sales capabilities are not well-defined and are therefore overlooked both conceptually and empirically. This study distinguishes between sales force management capabilities and personal selling capability, examines their interplay, and ultimately analyzes their impact on the firm's performance. The findings indicate that sales capabilities have a dual mechanism in enhancing performance: directly through a well-structured sales force and indirectly by leveraging personal selling capability through nurturing sales talent and targeting customers. By developing, identifying, and validating sales force management and personal selling capability empirically, this research contributes to the literature on sales as well as to the literature on capabilities, in general, and to the connection between sales capabilities and performance.

<p>The rapid invasion and spread of Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894) within new continents and climatic ranges has created favorable conditions for the emergence of tropical arboviral diseases in the invaded areas. We used mosquito abundance data from 2014 collected across ten sites in northern Italy to calibrate a population model for Aedes albopictus and estimate the potential of imported human cases of chikungunya or dengue to generate the condition for their autochthonous transmission in the absence of control interventions. The model captured intra-year seasonality and heterogeneity across sites in mosquito abundance, based on local temperature patterns and the estimated site-specific mosquito habitat suitability. A robust negative correlation was found between the latter and local late spring precipitations, indicating a possible washout effect on larval breeding sites. The model predicts a significant risk of chikungunya outbreaks in most sites if a case is imported between the beginning of summer and up to mid-November, with an average outbreak probability between 4.9% and 25%, depending on the site. A lower risk is predicted for dengue, with an average probability between 4.2% and 10.8% for cases imported between mid-July and mid-September. This study shows the importance of an integrated entomological and medical surveillance for the evaluation of arboviral disease risk, which is a precondition for designing cost-effective vector control programs.</p>"

<p>The current economic crisis has had spatially differentiated impacts in both the US and Europe. A growing collection of literature investigates the determinants of the magnitude of this recession across regions. This paper aims to contribute to this literature by analysing variations in unemployment rate across European regions over the period 2004-11. In particular, we focus on two apparently neglected issues, namely labour market rigidity and the sensitivity of the local economy to the national or European business cycle. The rigidity of the labour market is increasingly viewed as a possible reason for differences among countries in terms of the performance of labour markets, although existing empirical evidence remains inconclusive. In this respect, our aim is to assess the relevance of national labour legislation, as measured by the OECD Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) Index for the performance of regional labour markets by taking advantage of the natural experiment provided by the crisis. Furthermore, for the first time in economic literature, we employ quarterly data on unemployment rate for all European regions over the period 2000-11 to construct an index of co-movement regarding regional cycles with national or European cycles, to be used as an important determinant of variation in the unemployment rate. After controlling for a number of covariates, as well as for spatial dependence in various forms, our results indicate that EPL did not affect unemployment growth over the entire period. However, we did find that regions with a low long-term unemployment rate in countries with high EPL performed better in the pre-crisis period (2004-07), whereas no effect was found during the crisis. We also found that synchronisation of the regional cycle with the national one was significant for explaining regional labour market performance. Taken together, these results denote the limited relevance of national policies and legislation for accommodating spatially differentiated shocks, whereas policies aimed at modifying local cycles may prove to be more effective.</p>"

<p>Education is a key sociological variable in the explanation of health and health disparities. Conventional wisdom emphasizes a life course-human capital perspective with expectations of causal effects that are quasi-linear, large in magnitude for high levels of educational attainment, and reasonably robust in the face of measured and unmeasured explanatory factors. We challenge this wisdom by offering an alternative theoretical account and an empirical investigation organized around the role of measured and unmeasured cognitive and noncognitive skills as confounders in the association between educational attainment and health. Based on longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-1997 spanning mid-adolescence through early adulthood, results indicate that (1) effects of educational attainment are vulnerable to issues of omitted variable bias, (2) measured indicators of cognitive and noncognitive skills account for a significant proportion of the traditionally observed effect of educational attainment, (3) such skills have effects larger than that of even the highest levels of educational attainment when appropriate controls for unmeasured heterogeneity are incorporated, and (4) models that most stringently control for such time-stable abilities show little evidence of a substantive association between educational attainment and health.</p>"

<p>The pace of change in recorded music technology has accelerated faster than ever during the past two decades with the shift from analog to digital. Digital recordings provide consumers the unimpeded ability to access, sample, learn about, acquire, store, and share vast amounts of music as never before. Supporters of winner-take-all theory believe lower search and transaction costs brought about by digitization have led to greater convergence with fewer extraordinarily popular songs (blockbusters) and a smaller number of artists who perform them (superstars). Supporters of long-tail theory believe the same factors have led to less convergence and a greater number of songs and artists becoming blockbusters and superstars. This work pits these opposing predictions against each other empirically. More specifically, we examine how the number of songs and artists appearing annually on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart has changed between 1974 and 2013 in relation to three major turning points in technology associated with digitization. These turning points mark consumers' shift: (1) from analog records and cassettes to digital audio with the advent of CDs., (2) from CDs to compressed digital audio MP3s, and (3) from P2P networks and illegal file sharing to legitimate online distributors of digital downloads. In general, we observe a growing winner-take-all effect for songs until the advent of MP3s in 1998, when this trend abated. This result appears largely due to greater convergence in the Top 10. The trend reverses itself as the number of songs making the chart increases steadily after the launch of legitimate online music sellers such as iTunes. The exact opposite pattern is observed for artists. Initially, an increasing number of artists made the chart, and this trend continued unabated until 2003. After the emergence of legitimate online resellers, the trend reversed as fewer and fewer artists made it onto the chart. The overall pattern is summarized as a transition from fewer blockbusters by more superstars to more blockbusters by fewer superstars. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This article explores BRICS' engagement in the global movement for Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and the implications for global health governance. It is based on primary data collected from 43 key informant interviews, complemented by a review of BRICS' global commitments supporting UHC. Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire that included both closed- and open-ended questions. Question development was informed by insights from the literature on UHC, Cox's framework for action, and Kingdon's multiple-stream theory of policy formation. The closed questions were analysed with simple descriptive statistics and the open-ended questions using grounded theory approach. The analysis demonstrates that most BRICS countries implicitly supported the global movement for UHC, and that they share an active engagement in promoting UHC. However, only Brazil, China and to some extent South Africa, were recognized as proactively pushing UHC in the global agenda. In addition, despite some concerted actions, BRICS countries seem to act more as individual countries rather that as an allied group. These findings suggest that BRICS are unlikely to be a unified political block that will transform global health governance. Yet the documented involvement of BRICS in the global movement supporting UHC, and their focus on domestic challenges, shows that BRICS individually are increasingly influential players in global health. So if BRICS countries should probably not be portrayed as the centre of future political community that will transform global health governance, their individual involvement in global health, and their documented concerted actions, may give greater voice to low- and middle-income countries supporting the emergence of multiple centres of powers in global health.</p>"

<p>Purpose - This paper aims to examine the impact of customer perceptions about a salesperson's combined use of adaptive selling (AS) and selling orientation (SO) on customer trust in the salesperson. Based on insights from attribution theory, the contingency model of salespeople' effectiveness, relationship marketing and market orientation literatures, the authors analyze the interplay between customer perceptions of salespeople's AS and SO, and how this affects customer trust. Furthermore, adopting a contingency perspective, the authors investigate how two important situational variables (i.e. length of buyer-seller relationships and importance of purchase for the buyer) affect this relationship.</p>
<p>Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on regression analysis with two-and three-way interactions, using survey data from 134 business-to-business (B2B) buyers.</p>
<p>Findings - The results indicate that the interplay between AS and SO is negatively related to trust, and that the above situation is attenuated in sales contexts characterized by high purchase importance or enduring buyer-seller relationships.</p>
<p>Research limitations/implications - The empirical findings are based on firms from a single industry. Second, a cross-sectional research design is adopted. Third, the absence of measures of objective performance (e.g. sales) might be regarded as a limitation.</p>
<p>Practical implications - The study suggests that salespeople willing to win customer trust should modify their approach across the relationship life cycle. Similarly, when purchase importance for the customer is low, salespeople interested in building relationships based on trust should combine AS and customer orientation. In contrast, when purchase importance is high, salespeople can only generate more trust by increasing customer orientation/reducing SO. These findings might inspire sales trainers and sales managers in developing training experiences based on adaptation and customer orientation.</p>
<p>Originality/value - The research contributes in several ways to the literature. First, the simultaneous effect of AS and SO on performance (i.e. customer trust) was investigated. Second, the analysis of the interaction between AS and SO was complemented by testing two important boundary conditions residing in the selling situation: purchase importance and relationship length. Third, this study is the first to examine the interplay among AS, SO and selling context outside using customer data from actual B2B sales interactions. Also, it enhances knowledge of the effects of AS on sales outcomes by adding a long-term, relational outcome (i.e. trust) to previous work that tended to focus on short-term outcomes (i.e. sales revenues). Furthermore, by investigating perceived benefits from the point of view of customers rather than sellers, our findings add to previous studies of AS which relied too heavily, or exclusively, on the voice of the seller. Finally, this stu"

<p>This paper examines the efficiency rationale for democratic governance in economic organization. In addition to markets, hierarchies, and clans (the standard repertoire), democracy should be added as a viable and efficient form of organization, particularly for the modern knowledge-intensive economy. In fact, even using established organization theory and organizational economics, democratic governance would constitute a superior structural alternative under such conditions. Based on this theoretical argument and more than a decade of empirical research on the organization of new knowledge- based firms, as well as the governance of innovative activities in established firms, this paper advances a set of propositions articulating the efficient mix of governance mechanisms defining such democratic structural alternative; they include ""partnership"" rather than ""exchange"" employment contracts, ""democratic"" allocation of decision and control rights, negotiated rent-sharing, and open boundaries. The potential and due applications of these practices to situations where knowledge contributions are present but not prominent are highlighted.</p>"

<p>We examine whether the level of a firm's conditional conservatism affects investor disagreement around earnings announcement dates. Investor disagreement is relevant for its repercussions on stock market efficiency. However, the literature related to the effect of firms' reporting policies on disagreement is scant. Prior research suggests that conservatism, by requiring higher verifiability of profits, constrains earnings overstatements and encourages more complete revelations of losses, thus improving the information environment. In this paper, we further hypothesize that these effects of conservatism enhance news credibility and decrease information asymmetry, particularly for bad news announcements. This results in a lower disagreement and improved interpretation of earnings news. We consistently find that conservatism measures are negatively associated with proxies of announcement-time investor disagreement and that this effect is stronger when the firm is reporting bad news. Additional analyses indicate that the impact of conservatism is stronger when market surprise to the announcement is greater, while it is weaker in the presence of frequent and precise voluntary disclosure that preempts the earnings announcement. Finally, we show that a higher percentage of institutional investors' ownership and a higher level of commitment to conservatism reinforce the impact of the latter.</p>"

<p>Background: For the past few decades, randomized clinical trials have provided evidence for effective treatments by comparing several competing therapies. Their successes have led to numerous new therapies to combat many diseases. However, since their conclusions are based on the entire cohort in the trial, the treatment recommendation is for everyone, and may not be the best option for an individual. Medical research is now focusing more on providing personalized care for patients, which requires investigating how patient characteristics, including novel biomarkers, modify the effect of current treatment modalities. This is known as heterogeneity of treatment effects. A better understanding of the interaction between treatment and patient-specific prognostic factors will enable practitioners to expand the availability of tailored therapies, with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes. The Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot (STEPP) approach was developed to allow researchers to investigate the heterogeneity of treatment effects on survival outcomes across values of a (continuously measured) covariate, such as a biomarker measurement.</p>
<p>Methods: Here, we extend the Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot approach to continuous, binary, and count outcomes, which can be easily modeled using generalized linear models. With this extension of Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern Plot, these additional types of treatment effects within subpopulations defined with respect to a covariate of interest can be estimated, and the statistical significance of any observed heterogeneity of treatment effect can be assessed using permutation tests. The desirable feature that commonly used models are applied to well-defined patient subgroups to estimate treatment effects is retained in this extension.</p>
<p>Results: We describe a simulation study to confirm that the proper Type I error rate is maintained when there is no treatment heterogeneity, and a power study to show that the statistics have power to detect treatment heterogeneity under alternative scenarios. As an illustration, we apply the methods to data from the Aspirin/Folate Polyp Prevention Study, a clinical trial evaluating the effect of oral aspirin, folic acid, or both as a chemoprevention agent against colorectal adenomas. The pre-existing R software package stepp has been extended to handle continuous, binary, and count data using Gaussian, Bernoulli, and Poisson models, and it is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The extension of the method and the availability of new software now permit STEPP to be applied to the full range of clinical trial end points.</p>"

<p>Viruses are a major threat to human health, and-given that they spread through social interactions-represent a costly externality. This article addresses three main questions: (i) what are the unintended consequences of economic activity on the spread of infections; (ii) how efficient are measures that limit interpersonal contacts; (iii) how do we allocate our scarce resources to limit the spread of infections? To answer these questions, we use novel high frequency data from France on the incidence of a number of viral diseases across space, for different age groups, over a quarter of a century. We use quasi-experimental variation to evaluate the importance of policies reducing interpersonal contacts such as school closures or the closure of public transportation networks. While these policies significantly reduce disease prevalence, we find that they are not cost-effective. We find that expansions of transportation networks have significant health costs in increasing the spread of viruses, and that propagation rates are pro-cyclically sensitive to economic conditions and increase with inter-regional trade.</p>"

<p>The impact of health on economic development is a hotly debated issue in the economics literature, with most scholars supporting the idea that the diffusion of diseases is detrimental to development. In this context, pandemics are an important case study given their exogenous nature, which makes identification of the impact of diseases on development clearer than in other cases such as malaria or smallpox. This paper focuses on Spanish flu in Italy, one of the countries with the highest mortality rate due to the pandemic. By exploiting the regional variation in mortality and focusing on the hypothesis of the foetal origins of cognitive abilities, the long-run consequences of influenza exposure in terms of human capital accumulation are estimated.

<p>Our study reviewed policies in 8 high-income countries (Australia, Canada, United States, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Croatia and Estonia) in Europe,Australasia and North America with regard to hospitals in rural or remote areas. We explored whether any specific policies on hospitals in rural or remote areas are in place, and, if not, how countries made sure that the population in remote or rural areas has access to acute inpatient services. We found that only one of the eight countries (Italy) had drawn up a national policy on hospitals in rural or remote areas. In the United States, although there is no singular comprehensive national plan or vision, federal levers have been used to promote access in rural or remote areas and provide context for state and local policy decisions. In Australia and Canada, intermittent policies have been developed at the sub-national level of states and provinces respectively. In those countries where access to hospital services in rural or remote areas is a concern, common challenges can be identified, including the financial sustainability of services, the importance of medical education and telemedicine and the provision of quick transport to more specialized services.

<p>Our goal was to provide data on the economic burden and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and their caregivers in Europe.</p>
<p>A cross-sectional study was carried out on adults and children with CF in eight European countries. Patients completed an anonymous questionnaire regarding their socio-demographic characteristics, use of healthcare services and presence of a caregiver. Costs were calculated with a bottom-up approach using unit costs from each participating country, and HRQOL was assessed using EQ-5D. The principal caregiver also answered a questionnaire on their characteristics, HRQOL and burden.</p>
<p>A total of 905 patients with CF was included (399 adults and 506 children). The total average annual cost per patient varied from a,not sign21,144 in Bulgaria to a,not sign53,256 in Germany. Adults had higher direct healthcare costs than children, but children had much higher informal care costs (P < 0.0001). Total costs increased with patients' level of dependence. In adults, mean utility fell between 0.640 and 0.870, and the visual analogue scale ranged from 46.0 to 69.7. There was no difference in caregiver HRQOL regardless of whether they cared for an adult or a child. However, caregivers who looked after a child had a significantly higher burden (P = 0.0013).</p>
<p>Our study highlights the burden of CF in terms of costs and decreased HRQOL for both patients and their caregivers throughout Europe.</p>"

<p>The aim of this study was to determine the economic burden from a societal perspective and the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in Europe.</p>
<p>We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with DMD from Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. Data on demographic characteristics, healthcare resource utilization, informal care, labor productivity losses, and HRQOL were collected from the questionnaires completed by patients or their caregivers. HRQOL was measured with the EuroQol 5-domain (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Costs have been estimated from a societal perspective adopting a bottom-up approach.</p>
<p>A total of 422 questionnaires were included in the study; 268 of which were collected from patients with DMD and 154 from caregivers. The average annual cost per person in 2012 ranged from a,not sign7657 in Hungary to a,not sign58,704 in France. Direct non-healthcare costs are the main component of whole costs and informal care is the main driver of non-healthcare costs. Costs are also shown to differ between children and adults. With regard to HRQOL of adult patients, the EQ-5D VAS score and EQ-5D index scores were 50.5 and 0.24, respectively. The corresponding EQ-5D VAS and EQ-5D index scores for caregivers were 74.7 and 0.71, respectively.</p>
<p>We have estimated the average annual cost per patient with DMD in eight European countries adopting a social perspective, and to our knowledge this is the first study with such a wide perspective. The results on costs show a considerable gap between Eastern and Western European countries. Non-healthcare costs range from 64 to 89 % of overall costs and informal care is to a great extent the main driver of this cost category. The HRQOL of people with DMD is much lower than that of the general population.</p>"

<p>The aim of this study was to determine the economic burden from a societal perspective and the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with haemophilia in Europe.</p>
<p>We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with haemophilia from Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain Sweden and the UK. Data on demographic characteristics, health resource utilisation, informal care, loss of labour productivity and HRQOL were collected from the questionnaires completed by patients or their caregivers.

<p>A total of 401 questionnaires were included in the study, of which 339 were collected from patients with haemophilia and 62 from caregivers. The lowest average annual cost per person was reported in Bulgaria (a,not sign6,660) and the highest in Germany (a,not sign194,490). Our results demonstrate both a large difference from country to country in the average annual cost per patient in 2012 and the driving role of drugs in costs. Drugs represent nearly 90 % of direct healthcare costs in a majority of the countries analysed (Hungary, Italy, Spain and Germany). In Bulgaria, France and Sweden, however, healthcare services (visits, tests and hospitalisations) prevail. Costs are also shown to differ between children and adults. The mean EQ-5D index score for adult patients was 0.69 and mean EQ-5D VAS was 66.6. The mean EQ-5D index score for carers was 0.87 and mean EQ-5D VAS was 75.5. In the disability score, 60 % showed no disability and measuring caregiver burden with the Zarit Index produced an overall mean score of 25.3.</p>
<p>We have shown that haemophilia is associated with a substantial economic burden and impaired HRQOL. Studies on cost of illness and HRQOL are important for haemophilia as the future of this disease is likely to change with the development of new innovative treatments. The introduction of these treatments will most likely impact future costs related to haemophilia.</p>"

Demand and total factor productivity (TFP) shocks are equally important in shaping firm growth. However, the pass-through of shocks to growth is highly incomplete, more so for productivity shocks. We argue that incompleteness and asymmetry of the pass-through can be explained by frictions that, unlike those studied by the literature on factor misallocation, have differential effects according to the nature of the shock. We propose hurdles to firms' ability to reorganize as an example of these types of frictions.</p>"

<p>Research summary: Using a unique database that measures firm-level bribery in Africa and Latin America, we corroborate extant results in the literature that paying bribes deters firm investments in fixed assets. Our contribution is to explore four mechanisms. By adopting a reverse causality approach (Gelman and Imbens, 2013), we find evidence consistent with one of them: short-term oriented firms prefer to bribe rather than invest in fixed assets, while the opposite is true for firms with a long-term orientation. We rule out that bribe payments drain financial resources for investment, that firms that invest do not bribe because fixed assets make them less flexible and more vulnerable to future bribes, and that less efficient firms bribe rather than invest.Managerial summary: We ask whether, along with ethical issues, bribing affects the behavior and performance of firms in Africa and Latin America. Our statistical analysis shows that bribe payments do not reduce the short-term performance of firms, but frustrate investments in fixed assets, which is the foundation of firms' long-term growth. It is like seeking a job via nepotism or education. Nepotism makes it likely to find a job in the short term. However, the solid skills generated by education raise the odds of finding better jobs in the future. We rule out some common explanations for the trade-off between bribing and investment (e.g., bribes drain resources to invest or that less efficient firms bribe and do not invest). Our analysis suggests that firms with short-term orientations are more likely to bribe and firms with long-term orientation are more likely to invest. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>We have developed a method, called Meta-STEPP (subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot for meta-analysis), to explore treatment effect heterogeneity across covariate values in the meta-analysis setting for time-to-event data when the covariate of interest is continuous. Meta-STEPP forms overlapping subpopulations from individual patient data containing similar numbers of events with increasing covariate values, estimates subpopulation treatment effects using standard fixed-effects meta-analysis methodology, displays the estimated subpopulation treatment effect as a function of the covariate values, and provides a statistical test to detect possibly complex treatment-covariate interactions. Simulation studies show that this test has adequate type-I error rate recovery as well as power when reasonable window sizes are chosen. When applied to eight breast cancer trials, Meta-STEPP suggests that chemotherapy is less effective for tumors with high estrogen receptor expression compared with those with low expression.

<p>Background: Since the early 1980s all European countries have given priority to reforming the management of health services. A distinctive feature of these reforms has also been the drive to co-opt professionals themselves into the management of services, taking on full time or part time (hybrid) management or leadership roles. However, although these trends are well documented in the literature, our understanding of the nature and impact of reforms and how they are re-shaping the relationship between medicine and management remains limited. Most studies have tended to be nationally specific, located within a single discipline and focused primarily on describing new management practices. This article serves as an Introduction to a special issue of BMC Health Services Research which seeks to address these concerns. It builds on the work of a European Union funded COST Action (ISO903) which ran between 2009 and 2013, focusing specifically on the changing relationship between medicine and management in a European context.</p>
<p>Main text: Prior to describing the contributions to the special issue, this Introduction sets the scene by exploring four main questions which have characterised much of the recent literature on medicine and management. First is the question of what we understand by the changing relationship between medicine and management and in particular which this means for the emergence of so called 'hybrid' clinical leader roles? A second question concerns the forces that have driven change, in particular those relating to the wider project of management reforms. Third, we raise questions of how medical professionals have responded to these changes and what factors have shaped their responses. Lastly we consider what some of the outcomes of greater medical involvement in management and leadership might be, both in terms of intended and unintended outcomes.</p>
<p>Conclusions: The paper concludes by summarising the contributions to the special issue and highlighting the need to extend research in this area by focusing more on comparative dimensions of change. It is argued that future research would also benefit theoretically by drawing together insights from health policy and management literatures.</p>"

<p>Background: Involving doctors in management has been intended as one of the strategies to spread organizational principles in healthcare settings. However, professionals often resist taking on relevant managerial responsibility, and the question concerning by which means to engage doctors in management in a manner that best fit the challenges encountered by different health systems remains open to debate.</p>
<p>Methods: This paper analyzes the different forms of medical management experienced over time in the Italian NHS, a relevant ""lab"" to study the evolution of the involvement of doctors in management, and provides a framework for disentangling different dimensions of medical management.</p>
<p>Results: We show how new means to engage frontline professionals in management spread, without deliberate planning, as a consequence of the innovations in service provision that are introduced to respond to the changes in the healthcare sector.</p>
<p>Conclusions: This trend is promising because such means of performing medical management appear to be more easily compatible with professional logics; therefore, this could facilitate the engagement of a large proportion of professionals rather than the currently limited number of doctors who are ""forced"" or willing to take formal management roles.</p>"

<p>The general pattern of estimated volatilities of macroeconomic and financial variables is often broadly similar. We propose two models in which conditional volatilities feature comovement and study them using U.S. macroeconomic data. The first model specifies the conditional volatilities as driven by a single common unobserved factor, plus an idiosyncratic component. We label this model BVAR with general factor stochastic volatility (BVAR-GFSV) and we show that the loss in terms of marginal likelihood from assuming a common factor for volatility is moderate. The second model, which we label BVAR with common stochastic volatility (BVAR-CSV), is a special case of the BVAR-GFSV in which the idiosyncratic component is eliminated and the loadings to the factor are set to 1 for all the conditional volatilities. Such restrictions permit a convenient Kronecker structure for the posterior variance of the VAR coefficients, which in turn permits estimating the model even with large datasets. While perhaps misspecified, the BVAR-CSV model is strongly supported by the data when compared against standard homoscedastic BVARs, and it can produce relatively good point and density forecasts by taking advantage of the information contained in large datasets.</p>"

We establish that each of the differential games (pursuit or evasion) is equivalent to a differential game of m groups of countably many pursuers and one group of countably many evaders in Euclidean space. All the players in any of these groups are controlled by one controlled parameter. We find a condition under which pursuit can be completed, and if this condition is not satisfied, then evasion is possible. We construct strategies for the pursuers in pursuit game which ensure completion the game for a finite time and give a formula for this time.

<p>This paper studies how local food specialities can affect the attractiveness of tourist destinations, distinguishing between market-expanding and business-stealing effects. We surveyed 1100 Italians in their home about their intention to visit or revisit three popular mountain resorts in Northern Italy (Valtellina, Valle d'Aosta, Trentino), and about their experience, knowledge, and appreciation of five well-known local food products of these places (Pizzoccheri pasta, Bresaola dried beef, Fontina cheese, Melinda apples, Speck smoked ham). We find that product experience positively affects the likelihood of (re)visiting both a product's place of origin and the other mountain destinations (market-expanding effect). Conversely, the correct identification of the product's place of origin may reduce the intention to (re)visit the other destinations (business-stealing effect). Finally, strong appreciation for a local food speciality has a positive effect only on the intention to (re)visit the place of origin. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Background: Gaps remain in understanding how performance-based incentive (PBI) programs affect quality of care and service quantity, whether programs are cost effective and how programs could be tailored to meet client and provider needs while remaining operationally viable. In 2014, Malawi's Ministry of Health launched the Service Delivery Integration-PBI (SSDI-PBI) program. The program is unique in that no portion of performance bonuses are paid to individual health workers, and it shifts responsibility for infrastructure and equipment procurement from facility staff to implementing partners. This protocol outlines an approach that analyzes processes and outcomes, considers expected and unexpected consequences of the program and frames the program's outputs relative to its costs. Findings from this evaluation will inform the intended future scale-up of PBI in Malawi.</p>
<p>Methods/design: This study employs a prospective controlled before-and-after triangulation design to assess effects of the PBI program by analyzing quantitative and qualitative data from intervention and control facilities. Guided by a theoretical framework, the evaluation consists of four main components: service provision, health worker motivation, implementation processes and costing. Quality and access outcomes are assessed along four dimensions: (1) structural elements (related to equipment, drugs, staff); (2) process elements (providers' compliance with standards); (3) outputs (service utilization); (4) experiential elements (experiences of service delivery). The costing component includes costs related to start-up, ongoing management, and the cost of incentives themselves. The cost analysis considers costs incurred within the Ministry of Health, funders, and the implementing agency. The evaluation relies on primary data (including interviews and surveys) and secondary data (including costing and health management information system data).</p>
<p>Discussion: Through the lens of a PBI program, we illustrate how complex interventions can be evaluated via not only primary, mixed-methods data collection, but also through a wealth of secondary data from program implementers (including monitoring, evaluation and financial data), and the health system (including service utilization and service readiness data). We also highlight the importance of crafting a theory and using theory to inform the nature of data collected. Finally, we highlight the need to be responsive to stakeholders in order to enhance a study's relevance.</p>"

<p>We interview both parents and their children enrolled in six primary schools in the district of Treviso (Italy). We study the structural differences between the children network of friends reported by children and the one elicited asking their parents. We find that the parent-reported network has a bias that is consistent with the following explanation: parents expect peer effects on school achievement to be stronger than what they really are. Thus, parents of low-performing students report their children to be friends of high performing students. Our numerical simulations indicate that when this bias is combined with a bias on how some children target friends, then there is a multiplier effect on the expected school achievement.

<p>We report new experimental data on a simple common value auction to investigate the extent to which bidding can be explained by logit QRE, in combination with different models about bidder beliefs: cursed equilibrium, level-k, and cognitive hierarchy. There is a close correspondence between the predicted bidding patterns in those models and the distribution of observed bids. The pattern of median bids in the data consists of a combination of overbidding with low signals, and near-value-bidding with higher signals. Logit QRE with heterogeneous bidders approximates this pattern. Combining QRE with any of the other models of belief formation leads to a closer match with the data. All the estimated models predict only small treatment effects across different versions of the game, consistent with the data. We also reanalyze an earlier dataset for the same game (Ivanov et al., 2010), which exhibited much more overbidding, and reach similar qualitative conclusions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

<p>Background: An evolution led to community pharmacies experiencing increased competition both between themselves and with new entrants in the sector, for example, grocery retailers. Applying certain retail marketing strategies aimed at developing store loyalty may be an appropriate strategic path for pharmacies wanting to compete in this new arena.</p>
<p>Objectives: This study aimed to develop and test a two-step model to identify the determinants of store loyalty for community pharmacies in Italy.</p>
<p>Methods: Based on the retail literature, qualitative research was conducted to identify key variables determining loyalty to community pharmacies. The model was then tested by means of a phone survey. A total of 735 usable questionnaires was collected.</p>
<p>Results: The study highlights the key role of the relationship between pharmacists and their customers in the loyalty-building path; trust in pharmacists is the first driver of satisfaction and a direct and indirect (through satisfaction) driver of trust in pharmacies, which leads to store loyalty. Retail-level levers, such as the store environment, assortment, and communication, influence trust in pharmacies.</p>

New macro and micro evidence is provided highlighting the importance of these interactions in explaining cross-country differences in labor market adjustment to shocks. Having identified the labor market institutions responsible for this increasing unemployment divergence, we consider what can be done at the EU level to promote institutional convergence. In particular, we discuss a ""positive conditionality"" approach that could operate also in good times, and not only under recessions, when conditionality is strong, but some reforms may backfire.

<p>The transformation of waste into a valuable resource is a key process towards sustainable development and green growth and therefore represents a major concern for policy-makers. Technological innovation plays a crucial role in waste management and therefore understanding the way in which regulation may spur innovation in this domain constitute is crucial. This article aims at testing the weak version of the Porter hypothesis in waste management, by analysing the dynamic relationship between the stringency of environmental regulation and innovation in a European cross-country setting. Results confirm that the stringency of regulation positively affects innovation, but the effect is non-linear, suggesting the existence of an optimal cap to the stringency of regulation. Furthermore, the overall environmental conditions of the country, as well as the presence of highly polluting sectors hinder the development of environmental innovations.</p>"

<p>Composite indicators are becoming increasingly influential tools of environmental assessment and advocacy. Nonetheless, their use is controversial as they often rely on ad-hoc and theoretically problematic assumptions regarding normalization, aggregation, and weighting. Nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods, originating in the production-economics literature, have been proposed as a means of addressing these concerns. These methods dispense with contentious normalization and weighting techniques by focusing on a measure of best-case relative performance. Recently, the standard DEA model for composite indicators was extended to account for worst-case analysis by Zhou et al. (Ecol Econ 62(2):291-297, 2007) [hereafter, ZAP]. In this note we argue that, while valid and interesting in its own right, the measure adopted by ZAP may not capture, in a mathematical as well as practical sense, the notion of worst-case relative performance. By contrast, we focus on the strict worst-case analogue of standard DEA for composite indicators and show how it leads to tractable optimization problems. Finally, we compare the two methodologies using data from ZAP's Sustainable Energy Index case study, demonstrating that they occasionally lead to divergent results.</p>"

<p>The phenomenon of increased desire for, and use of, appearance-enhancing items during times of economic recession has been termed the lipstick effect. The motivation underlying this effect has been attributed to women's desires to enhance their attractiveness to financially stable partners (Hill, Rodeheffer, Griskevicius, Durante, & White, 2012). In the present research, we found evidence for our proposal that during times of economic recession, the heightened economic concern experienced by women translates into increased desire to use appearance-enhancing items to both attract romantic partners and create a favorable impression of themselves in the workplace, as both strategies can help women become secure financially. We also found that women with high economic concern elect to improve their professional appearance more frequently than their romantic attractiveness, which suggests that their motivation to obtain resources through a job dominates their motivation to obtain resources through a partner.</p>"

<p>This article examines the impact of structural changes in the postwar film industry on the activities and effectiveness of the foreign distribution subsidiaries of American firms. As these subsidiaries saw their regular supply of films from their in-house Hollywood studios decline, they sought out alternative sources of product content, often from local markets. Unable to rely on the traditional ownership advantages bestowed on them by their parent firms, these subsidiaries increasingly needed to integrate into local networks and forge closer relationships with local producers and exhibitors. Our focus is on Italy, one of the most important film markets for US companies in the 1960s. We collect data on the box office revenues and screen time allocated to every film released into the first-run cinema market and compare the effectiveness of American versus Italian distributors in maximizing the exposure of their most popular films. We explore the attempts by US firms to form partnerships with Italian distributors and producers. Finally, we examine available archival records to reveal the detailed activities of US distribution offices in Italy and their attempts to integrate into local business networks. We conclude that while US subsidiaries did not fully succeed in becoming insiders within the Italian film industry in this period, they did actively work toward such an objective.</p>"

<p>Contrary to conventional wisdom, recent studies argue that parenthood is not necessarily related to higher parental subjective well-being (SWB). However, parenthood remains an important aspect of adults' lives, also in highly developed societies where childbearing has become optional, financially expensive and affecting other goals in life. Whereas a great deal of effort has been put into answering why fertility is low in so many developed countries, one may even ask why is it not even lower. The answer is not obvious but stems from the fact that, to date, the relationship between fertility and SWB has been understudied and the mechanisms at work are not well understood. This special issue makes a step forward in this line of research, providing a coherent set of papers addressing different dimensions of the relationship between fertility and SWB and its mechanisms, starting from a demographic perspective, but integrating theories and research results from other disciplines. The collection of papers assesses the effect of the birth of a child on the individual SWB from angles still unexplored with the idea that the effects of fertility on individuals' SWB are diverse depending on individual, couple and country contextual factors.</p>"

<p>The existing literature has so far considered the role of the individual's subjective well-being on fertility, neglecting the importance of the partner's well-being. Using data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and event history models estimated separately by parity, we find that in a couple, women's happiness matters more than that of the male partner in terms of having the first child. Specifically, we observe that couples in which either partner is happier than usual are more at risk of having the first child, but the effect is stronger with higher happiness of the woman. For the transition to the second child, we find that couples in which the woman declares to be happier or less happy than usual have a lower risk of childbirth. We, moreover, find support for a multiplicative effect of partners' SWB on the decision to have a first child. Our results show that failing to acknowledge that the subjective well-being of both partners matters for the inherently joint decision making of childbearing can lead to an incomplete view of how subjective well-being affects fertility.</p>"

<p>Many empirical studies find that parents are not as happy as non-parents or that parenthood exerts a negative effect on subjective well-being (SWB). We add to these findings by arguing that there is a key moderating factor that has been overlooked in previous research, i.e. the level of work-family conflict. We hypothesize that the birth of a child means an increase in the level of work-family tension, which may be substantial for some parents and relatively weak for others. To outline such an approach, we estimate fixed-effects models using panel data from the Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia survey. We find that childbearing negatively affects SWB only when parents, mothers in particular, face a substantial work-family conflict, providing thus support for our hypothesis.</p>"

<p>Parenthood has strong effects on people's life. Some of these effects are positive and some negative and may influence the decision of having other children after the first. Demographic research has only marginally addressed the relationship between subjective well-being and fertility, and even less attention has been reserved to investigate how the subjective experience of the first parenthood may influence the decision to have a second child. Performing log-logistic hazard models using HILDA panel data (2001-2012), changes in couples' objective life conditions and satisfaction within family and work domains after the first childbirth are related to the timing of the transition to the second parenthood. Results show that partners adopting traditional gender specialization in roles proceed quicker to the second child; however, experiencing dissatisfaction in reconciling, in the couple's relationship and in the work domain negatively affects mothers' probability of having a second child in the future.</p>"

<p>This paper studies the effects of changes in the level of product market regulation on the industry-level innovation intensity in the EU electricity sector during years 1990-2009. In order to test the impact of deregulatory policies on the propensity to innovate in energy technologies, we match data on R&D budgets and European Patent Office patent applications from International Energy Agency and Eurostat Databases with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development indexes of product market regulation. The analysis addresses innovations in the traditional electricity-related technologies, but keeping aside renewable energy technologies. Findings show an increase in patenting activities following market deregulation, measured along three factors: entry barriers, public ownership and vertical integration. In particular, econometric results suggest that policies aimed at reducing vertical integration - i.e. to unbundle networks from energy generation and supply - have a positive impact on innovation activity. Results are robust to the introduction of controls for country-level public R&D expenditures in the electricity field.</p>"

<p>This article investigates whether and how having a child impacts an individual's subjective well-being, while taking into account heterogeneity in family attitudes. People with different family orientations have different values, gender attitudes, preferences toward career and family, and expectations about how childbearing can affect their subjective well-being. These differences impact fertility decisions and the effect of parenthood on an individual's life satisfaction. We define three groups of people based on their family orientations: Traditional, Mixed, and Modern. Applying propensity score matching on longitudinal data (British Household Panel Survey), we create groups of individuals with very similar socioeconomic characteristics and family orientations before childbearing. We then compare those who have one child with those who are childless, and those who have two children with those who have only one child. We show that parents are significantly more satisfied than nonparents, and this effect is stronger among men than among women. For men, we do not find significant differences across family orientations groups in the effect of the birth of the first child on life satisfaction. Among women, only Traditional mothers seem to be more satisfied than their childless counterparts. Women who have a second child are never more satisfied than those who have only one child, regardless of their family orientations. Traditional and Mixed men experience a gain in life satisfaction when they have a second child, but this effect is not found for Modern men.</p>"

<p>We examine incomplete annuity menus, background risk, bequest motives, and default risk as possible drivers of divergence from full annuitization. Contrary to what is often suggested in the literature, we find that full annuitization remains optimal if saving is possible after retirement. This holds irrespective of whether real or only nominal annuities are available. Whenever liquidity is desired, individuals save sizeable amounts out of their annuity income to smooth consumption shocks. Similarly, adding equity-linked annuities to the menu does not increase welfare significantly, since individuals can invest in stocks in order to get the desired equity exposure.

<p>Process monitoring is essential and plays a vital role in enhancing the quality of the output. For this purpose, many statistical tools are used in practice and the control chart is one of the most popular choices. Bayesian and classical set-ups are two major and popular categories for defining the design structures of different types of control charts. This study planned to investigate the Bayesian control charts under different loss functions to ensure an efficient monitoring of process parameters for quality control. The performance measures used in this study are average run length (ARL), relative ARL (RARL), extra quadratic loss (EQL) and performance comparison index (PCI). It has been observed that the application of Bayesian structure of process monitoring needs careful consideration in terms of prior distribution, sampling and posterior (predictive) distributions, and the choice of loss functions, in order to obtain reliable outcomes.</p>"

For example, the literature narrowly identifies entrepreneurship with start-ups and self-employment; does not theorize many potentially relevant inter-level links and mechanisms; and suffers from sample limitations, omitted variable biases, causality issues, and response heterogeneity. We argue that theories in management research, such as the resource-based view, transaction cost economics, and strategic entrepreneurship theory, can fill some of the conceptual and theoretical gaps.</p>"

<p>Over one billion people lack access to electricity and many of them in rural areas far from existing infrastructure. Off-grid systems can provide an alternative to extending the grid network and using renewable energy, for example solar photovoltaics (PV) and battery storage, can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from electricity that would otherwise come from fossil fuel sources. This paper presents a model capable of comparing several mature and emerging PV technologies for rural electrification with diesel generation and grid extension for locations in India in terms of both the levelised cost and lifecycle emissions intensity of electricity. The levelised cost of used electricity, ranging from $0.46-1.20/kWh, and greenhouse gas emissions are highly dependent on the PV technology chosen, with battery storage contributing significantly to both metrics. The conditions under which PV and storage becomes more favourable than grid extension are calculated and hybrid systems of PV, storage and diesel generation are evaluated. Analysis of expected price evolutions suggest that the most cost-effective hybrid systems will be dominated by PV generation around 2018. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Retailers determine the assortment for a mix of product categories in a particular space (e.g., the checkout aisle, endcaps, freezer space). Within such a ""target"" space, shoppers are exposed to a selection of product categories that are not necessarily correlated in consumption. In this article, the authors examine whether the assortment of one category affects consumers' purchase incidence decision in another, independent category that shares a common display space (e.g., frozen meals and ice cream). They use a multivariate probit model of purchase incidence and incorporate assortment variety captured by an entropy measure. Results from analyses of IRI data and an online experiment provide strong evidence that consumers are less likely to purchase from a category of a given assortment when it is presented with another category assortment of greater variety and that this effect is driven by the display proximity. Furthermore, results from an eye-tracking study indicate consumers' allocation of limited attention to category assortments as an explanation for the finding. This work serves as one of the first studies to document the impact of product assortment beyond a focal category, and the results highlight a limitation of individual category management when grocery retailers make product assortment decisions.</p>"

<p>The lack of pan-European guidelines for empowering children of parents with mental illness led to the EU project CAMILLE - Empowerment of Children and Adolescents of Mentally Ill Parents through Training of Professionals working with children and adolescents. The aim of this initial task in the project was to analyse needs, expectations and consequences for children with respect to living with a parent with mental illness from the perspective of professionals and family members. This qualitative research was conducted in England, Finland, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland and Scotland with 96 professionals, parents with mental illness, adult children and partners of parents with mental illness. A framework analysis method was used. Results of the study highlighted that the main consequences described for children of parental mental illness were role reversal; emotional and behavioural problems; lack of parent's attention and stigma. The main needs of these children were described as emotional support, security and multidisciplinary help. Implications for practice are that professionals working with parents with mental illness should be aware of the specific consequences for the children and encourage parents in their parental role; multi-agency collaboration is necessary; schools should provide counselling and prevent stigma.</p>"

<p>Plain language summaryThis article argues that the rapid evolution of expectations and influence capacity by corporate stakeholders requires managers in MNCs not only to adapt operating activities, but to rethink the purpose and overarching goal of the business enterprise, adapting it from a shareholder-primacy to a multi-stakeholder enterprise model. This complex adaptation process, however, requires the development of a specific form of competence to be developed and honed, different in kind from the typical capabilities focused on organizational change. With the help of concrete examples of sustainability-driven change initiatives, we discuss how the two enterprise models differ and how the development of this new type of competence facilitates the transition from one to the other.</p>
<p>Technical summaryThis article argues that the dynamic capabilities framework can be useful to study the evolutionary change processes that MNCs go through as they strive to innovate and adapt to societal pressures related to corporate sustainability. These pressures require MNCs to rethink and adapt core organizational elements and we argue that current dynamic capabilities theory is not sufficiently developed to explain these adaptive efforts. We suggest refining and extending theory in two directions: (1) distinguishing between behavioral, cognitive, and relational organizational elements as objects of the innovation, change, and learning dynamics; and (2) distinguishing between capabilities specific to generative variation and selection of innovative change and adaptation ideas from those specific to their diffusion and retention.

<p>We study how an excessively favorable regulatory environment for banks could arise even with a perfectly competitive credit market in a median voter world. In our occupational choice model with heterogeneous wealth endowments, market failure due to unobservability of entrepreneurial talent endogenously creates a misalignment between surplus maximizing reforms and reforms that are preferred by the median voter, who is a worker. This is in contrast to the world without market failure where the electorate unanimously vote in favor of surplus maximizing institutional reforms.

In 2010, Barilla initiated a sustainable farming project to significantly reduce the environmental impact of cultivating durum wheat, its most important raw material. Core components included replacing monoculture with crop rotation, collectively creating innovative approaches that support farmers' decision making and generating widely accessible guidelines for sustainability-oriented cropping knowledge and practices. These collaborative efforts initiated profound transformations within and beyond the organization's boundaries via increased production yields, reduced environmental impacts and improved sustainability of farming practices, which generated economic, social and ecological benefits for farmers, surrounding communities and the firm.

<p>Consumers frequently consume hedonic products together with other consumers and derive value from this shared experience. This article investigates the impact of shared consumption, a type of social influence that determines the enjoyment of joint experiences, in the context of a typical hedonic product: movies. The authors argue that this type of influence has important consequences for the diffusion curves of hedonic goods that are consumed together and the effectiveness of advertising in generating launch and postlaunch sales. An empirically validated agent-based model simulates the U.S. motion picture market, with new movies launching, competing, and exiting. The agent-based model serves as a means to demonstrate the essential role of shared consumption for explaining movie life cycles and tests how advertising expenditures accelerate and/or acquire movies' demand in markets with varying levels of shared consumption. The results provide key theoretical insights for the new product diffusion of hedonic products and help managers predict the financial consequences of their strategic decisions.</p>"

<p>Packaging waste is a major issue in several countries. Representing in industrialized countries around 30-35% of municipal solid waste yearly generated, this waste stream has steadily grown over the years even if, especially in Europe, specific recycling and recovery targets have been fixed. Therefore, an increasing attention starts to be devoted to prevention measures and interventions. Filling a gap in the current literature, this explorative paper is a first attempt to map the increasingly important phenomenon of prevention policies in the packaging sector. Through a theoretical sampling, 11 countries/states (7 in and 4 outside Europe) have been selected and analyzed by gathering and studying primary and secondary data. Results show evidence of three specific trends in packaging waste prevention policies: fostering the adoption of measures directed at improving packaging design and production through an extensive use of the life cycle assessment; raising the awareness of final consumers by increasing the accountability of firms; promoting collaborative efforts along the packaging supply chains.

<p>One of the most widespread implications of the Great Financial Crisis has been the increase in bankruptcies across advanced economies. The traditional approach to the problem of insolvencies is constrained by deeply ingrained concepts of money and credit and by the institutions in which those concepts are embodied, according to which the only way to discharge a debt is a payment in money. This paper deals with a peculiar project elaborated within the Italian Ministry of Justice to address the problem of the growing amount of uncollectibles involved in bankruptcy procedures. The project entails a new form of articulation between money and credit, which overturns the traditional logic of liquidation by transforming creditors of bankruptcy procedures, passively waiting to be paid, into active operators, capable of sustaining demand. This goal is pursued by converting part of their credits into purchasing power that can be immediately spent in the auctions for the assets of bankrupt companies, thereby increasing the efficiency of bankruptcy procedures, accelerating the reallocation of assets and maximising the satisfaction of creditors. The projects may be seen as a complementary currency characterised by a functional, and not by a territorial, delimitation. It incorporates some of the features that have been recently experimented with, with varying degree of success, within both the official and alternative monetary systems: endogenous money creation, targeted loans and demurrage. The present paper aims at illustrating the theoretical underpinnings of the project and its implication for the question of devising an alternative to current financial institutions.</p>"

The latter only emerges once we allow for the value of workers' skills to differ in the pre-and post-devaluation periods.

<p>Posterior and predictive distributions for in future trials, given the first n elements of an infinite exchangeable sequence (xi(1)) over tilde, (xi(2)) over tilde (,) ..., are considered in a nonparametric Bayesian setting. The former distribution is compared to the unit mass at the empirical distribution (e) over tilde (n) :=1/n Sigma(n)(i=1) delta((xi 1) over tilde) of the n past observations, while the latter is compared to the m-fold product (e) over tilde (m)(n). Comparisons are made by means of distinguished probability distances inducing topologies that are equivalent to (or finer than) the topology of weak convergence of probability measures. After stating almost sure convergence to zero of these distances as n goes to infinity, the paper focuses on the analysis of the rate of approach to zero, so providing a quantitative evaluation of the approximation of posterior and predictive distributions through their frequentistic counterparts delta(e) over tilde (n) and (e) over tilde (m)(n), respectively. Characteristic features of the present work, with respect to more common literature on Bayesian consistency, are: first, comparisons are made between entities which depend on the n past observation only; second, the approximations are studied under the actual (exchangeable) law of the (xi(n)) over tilde 's, and not under hypothetical product laws p(0)(infinity), as p(0) varies among the admissible determinations of a random probability measure.

<p>This paper applies the Europeanization toolkit' to EU democratization policies in Morocco within the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) framework. To this aim, the bottom-up and top-down dimensions of EUMorocco relations are analysed diachronically both before and after the Arab Spring. The analysis shows that the Moroccan ruling elite has used the anchor to the EU as a survival strategy and that the EU has merely responded to Moroccan political liberalization rather than having influenced it. Therefore, the paper debates the extent to which the very notion of Europeanization might be used with respect to democratization policies in Morocco, and it shows an overturning of the senderreceiver relationship proving that Europeanization has been used instrumentally rather than having any autonomous supportive effect on democratization.</p>"

<p>Background</p>
<p>The relationship between the risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and people's choices about life course events describing the transition to parenthood-sexual debut, union (in the form of marriage, cohabitation, or long-term relationship), and parenthood-is still unclear. A crucial role in shaping this relationship may be played by the sequence of these events and by their timing. This suggests the opportunity to focus on the life courses in their entirety rather than on the specific events, thus adopting a holistic approach that regards each individual's life course trajectory as a whole.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>We summarise the individual life courses describing the transition to parenthood using ordered sequences of the three considered events. We aim to (i) investigate the association between the sequences and HIV infection, and (ii) understand how these sequences interact with known mechanisms for HIV transmission, such as the length of sexual exposure and the experience of non-regular sexual partnerships. For this purpose, we use data from a general population cohort study run in Manicaland (Zimbabwe), a Sub-Saharan African area characterised by high HIV prevalence.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>For both genders, individuals who experienced either premarital or delayed childbearing have higher HIV risk compared to individuals following more standard transitions. This can be explained by the interplay of the sequences with known HIV proximate determinants, e.g., a longer exposure to sexual activity and higher rates of premarital sex. Moreover, we found that people in the younger birth cohorts experience more normative and safer sequences.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>The shift of younger generations towards more normative transitions to parenthood is a sign of behaviour change that might have contributed to the observed reduction in HIV prevalence in the area. On the other hand, for people with less normative transitions, tar geted strategies are essential for HIV prevention.</p>"

<p>This study applies mixture modelling to examine age-specific immunity to varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection in Norway based on the first large-scale serological study in the general population. We estimated the seropositive proportions at different ages and calculated the underlying force of infection by using a sample of 2103 residual sera obtained from patients seeking primary and hospital care. A rapid increase in the VZV-associated immunity is observed in the first years of life with 63% of children being immune by age 5. The increase in the immunity levels slows down thereafter, with a large proportion of adults still susceptible by age 20 (around 14.5%), thus at risk of serious sequelae of varicella infection. The corresponding force of infection peaks during the preschool period, subsequently declines to a minimum between ages 10 and 20 years, and afterwards moderately increases to reach a plateau lasting throughout the childbearing period. In comparison with the traditional cut-off approach, mixture modelling used the whole data without producing any inconclusive cases, led to an unbiased classification of individuals between susceptible and immune, and provided a smoother immune profile by age. These findings represent an important step towards any decision about the introduction of varicella vaccination in Norway, as they are a primary input for mathematical transmission models aimed at evaluating potential vaccination scenarios.</p>"

<p>According to the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), integrated reporting (IR) should disclose the leading indicators that managers use in their sustainability decision processes and thus overcome traditional silo thinking. In this respect, IR could favor the integrative management of sustainability. Yet some scholars are more critical and argue that IR cannot contribute to sustainability management.</p>
<p>This article contributes to the debate by analyzing how IR adopters communicate managerial aspects of corporate sustainability. Drawing on impression management studies, this study seeks to detect manipulations in this disclosure practice. A manual content analysis of reports available on the IIRC website and a multivariate statistical analysis reveal that firms offer biased IR disclosures. Firms not only provide limited forward-looking and quantitative disclosure of their actions to achieve sustainability outcomes but also avoid providing information about their sustainability performance when their social and environmental results are poor. The evidence suggests pessimistic conclusions about the capability of this reporting process to encourage the integrative management of corporate sustainability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>Consumers often touch products before reaching purchase decisions, and indeed touch improves evaluations of the given product. The present research investigates how touching a given product influences perception and choice of other seen products. We show that grasping a source product increases the visual fluency of a haptically similar product, thereby increasing the likelihood of choosing that product, but not the willingness to pay for it (Study 1). We also show that visually crowded rather than sparse product displays increase the effect of touch on choosing other haptically similar products, and that individuals' instrumental need for touch further modulates this effect (Study 2). Our results suggest that by manipulating or mimicking the haptic features (e.g., shape and size) of objects that consumers grasp while shopping, marketers can develop packaging that facilitates consumers' visual processing of their products, thereby increasing choice of those products.

<p>Background: Several randomized phase III trials in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) showed the clinical role of new targeted agents and their impact on tumor response and outcome of whose patients affected by advanced NET. In this study, we summarize the available clinical data related to clinical efficacy of targeted therapies in the treatment of advanced NETs. Methods: A meta-analysis of randomized studies in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines was performed after searching the databases of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the ASCO University Meeting for relevant publications. Results: One thousand 9 hundred and 8 cases were included in the meta-analysis; among these, 1012 were in the experimental arm and 896 were in the control arm. The pooled analysis of the use of target agents in NETs revealed significantly increased of progression free survival compared to control group (hazard ratio = 0.59, 95% CI:0.42-0.84; P = 0.003). Subgroup analysis of patients according to tumor site showed a difference in favor of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Moreover, targeted therapies improved the overall survival (hazard ratio = 0.79, 95%CI: 0.63-0.98; P = 0.03), and response rate (hazard ratio = 3.33, 95% CI 2.02-5.49; P < 0.00001) in all types of NETs. Conclusion: Our analysis supports the routine use of targeted agents for treatment of neuroendocrine tumors with particular regards to the pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.</p>"

<p>This study examines the impact of board decision processes on board task performance in family firms, contingent upon the presence of a family or a non-family CEO. Bridging insights from behavioral research on boards and the upper echelons perspective, it is suggested that influence of board decision processes on performance benefits from different aspects of CEO attributes. To the extent that family and non-family CEOs exhibit different cognitive frames, it is hypothesized that board processes contribute differently to board task performance, depending on whether a family or a non-family CEO is at the helm. An empirical analysis of a sample of Italian family firms provides support for two hypothesized effects: Use of knowledge and skills is more beneficial for board task performance under a non-family CEO; cognitive conflict is more beneficial under a family CEO. Contrary to expectations, the effects of effort norms do not differ between the two settings. This study contributes to research on both boards and family firms; new opportunities for advancements are discussed.</p>"

<p>Transport costs are widely considered as a key driver of competitive advantage of countries, regions and cities. Their relevance is even greater when scale economies are at work since production is concentrated and goods must be shipped. Recent literature has found that highways, by decreasing transport costs, are crucial in influencing agglomeration economies and ultimately urban development. In this article, we contribute to this literature by studying the effect of highway construction on the structure of local economies. In particular, we consider the effect of highways in Italian cities in terms of firm location by explicitly recognizing the pivotal role played by the transport sector and by intersectoral linkages in promoting development. The main research hypothesis is that the location of an highway exit in a given city attracts firms operating in the transport service sector and consequently transport-intensive firms. Our empirical evidence concerns Italian cities over the period 1951-2001 and exploits variation in employment, population and plants induced by the construction of the highway network. To deal with the endogeneity of the geography of highways exits, we propose as an instrument the geography of Roman roads. To this end, we have coded the whole network of Roman roads in Italy. We have found that the location of highway exits increases employment and the number of plants and that this growth is concentrated in transport service-intensive sectors. This result is robust to a number of checks, including eventual instrument non-validity and selection into treatment.</p>"

<p>World democracies widely differ in legislative, executive, and legal institutions. Different institutional environments induce different mappings from electoral outcomes to the distribution of power. We explore how these mappings affect voters' participation in an election. We show that the effect of such institutional differences on turnout depends on the distribution of voters' preferences. We uncover a novel contest effect: Given the preferences distribution, turnout increases and then decreases when we move from a more proportional to a less proportional power-sharing system; turnout is maximized for an intermediate degree of power sharing. Moreover, we generalize the competition effect, common to models of endogenous turnout: Given the institutional environment, turnout increases in the ex ante preferences evenness, and more so when the overall system has lower power sharing. These results are robust to a wide range of modeling approaches, including ethical voter models, voter mobilization models, and rational voter models.</p>"

<p>Discretionary spending is an important indicator of economic well-being. However, prior research is limited in empirically testing who is more likely to make discretionary purchases. To address this research gap, this article suggests that those who have less clearly and confidently defined, internally consistent, and temporally stable self-knowledge (i.e., those who have low self-concept clarity [SCC]) have higher discretionary spending tendencies than high-SCC individuals. The results indicate that low-SCC individuals have higher discretionary spending tendencies because they are more likely to adopt avoidant coping strategies than are high-SCC individuals. This research further tests the effectiveness of elaboration on potential outcomes in reducing the discretionary spending tendencies of individuals with high- or low-SCC and demonstrates that it is effective only for high-SCC individuals. This article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial implications of the results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Monthly regional data on pharmaceutical expenditures, volumes and policies in Italy from 2000 to 2014 are analysed using a difference-in-differences model enriched to capture short- versus long-term effects and simultaneous and interactive effects.

<p>Evidence on the impact over time of regional policies diversely introduced in different times have important policy implications. First, pharmaceutical policies interact with each other, and the combined effect may be different from what we would expect from the sum of each single policy. Hence, policymakers should be very careful in designing mixed policies for their unexpected combined effects. Second, the impact of policies tends to reduce over time. If longer-term impact is desired, it would be appropriate to introduce some adjustments over time. Third, policies have multiple effects, and this should be considered when they are designed. Finally, pharmaceutical policies may have an unintended impact on health and health care.</p>"

During policy formulation, accounting information was used mostly to provide answersimproving understanding. At the decision-making stage, the level of conflict influenced the quantity of information used, as well as the way it was used. Under low political conflict, accounting information primarily provided reassurance, whereas when there were conflicts between majority and opposition politicians, accounting information was used to (de)legitimize political positions and decisions.

<p>Robust methods for instrumental variable inference have received considerable attention recently. Their analysis has raised a variety of problematic issues such as size/power trade-offs resulting from weak or many instruments. We show that information reduction methods provide a useful and practical solution to this and related problems. Formally, we propose factor-based modifications to three popular weak-instrument-robust statistics, and illustrate their validity asymptotically and in finite samples. Results are derived using asymptotic settings that are commonly used in both the factor and weak-instrument literature. For the Anderson-Rubin statistic, we also provide analytical finite-sample results that do not require any underlying factor structure. An illustrative Monte Carlo study reveals the following. Factor-based tests control size regardless of instruments and factor quality. All factor-based tests are systematically more powerful than standard counterparts. With informative instruments and in contrast to standard tests: (i) power of factor-based tests is not affected by k even when large; and (ii) weak factor structure does not cost power. An empirical study on a New Keynesian macroeconomic model suggests that our factor-based methods can bridge a number of gaps between structural and statistical modeling.

<p>Background: The subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot (STEPP) is an appealing method for assessing the clinical impact of a predictive marker on patient outcomes and identifying a promising subgroup for further study.

<p>Research and development (R&D) professionals play a key role in companies' innovation performance. Whereas prior research has indicated the potential benefits of dual ladder career systems to retain and motivate R&D professionals, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the design properties of dual ladders that facilitate such positive effects. The purpose of this study is to address this research gap by exploring how organizations can design dual ladders to enhance R&D professionals' organizational commitment and career satisfaction. Drawing on contemporary justice theory, we point to two factors integral for the successful application of dual ladders: the perceived equality of the technical ladder and the transparency of the dual ladder. These factors are related to R&D professionals' organizational commitment and career satisfaction. Furthermore, this study investigates whether these relationships are moderated by R&D professionals' age and self-directedness in career management as well as firm size. The hypotheses are tested in a cross-level study with 9 heads of R&D departments, 32 human resource managers, and 382 R&D professionals from 32 organizations. Based on the analyses, this study finds positive relationships between the perceived equality and the transparency of the dual ladder with R&D professionals' organizational commitment and career satisfaction. In addition, the findings show that the effects of the perceived equality of the technical ladder on R&D professionals' career satisfaction are weaker at high levels of self-directed career management. The study contributes by developing theory on the consequences of dual ladders' design properties and moderating influences thereon. Thus, this research has implications for the literature on innovation management by expanding the knowledge on the interplay between career management and the human side of innovation.</p>"

<p>Institutional theory has been widely debated by scholars. A part of literature examines how institutional pressures act on company choices regarding proactive environmental strategies. However, the institutional perspective has still not completely clarified the influence of these pressures on the effectiveness of environmental management systems (EMSs) in achieving goals in terms of eco-innovation, competitiveness and corporate reputation. This paper analyses the role played by coercive, mimetic and normative forces in stimulating innovative and competitive responses by firms with an environmental certification. Using the results of a survey on 242 European EMAS-registered organisations, the paper highlights the more positive influence of mimetic and normative pressures than coercive ones.

<p>This paper addresses issues in the governance of the public-private partnership (PPP) with a review of a recent case: Metro Line M4 in Milan, Italy. The paper discusses how to optimize the use of public grants by channeling some into the equity of the concessionaire. This approach creates a truly public private special purpose vehicle (SPV) (i.e., concessionaire) that leaves efficiency incentives to the private party but results in greater public control of funding contributions as well as project costs. The paper demonstrates how public-sector involvement in the concessionaire can reduce the information asymmetry between the public and private sectors during project bidding and negotiation: greater public control of a project's technical and financial information is a crucial factor in the reduction of project costs. Reduction in information asymmetry and the creation of a public-private SPV (concessionaire) establish a double layer of control over a project, which allows for a more efficient monitoring system during the construction and the operation of the project. The paper shows how the City of Milan developed and negotiated the Line M4 project and left little margin for increased costs, yet ensured an adequate return to the private party. This Milan experience provides lessons to improve effective project delivery in infrastructure development: the method used can create an efficient framework to reduce project costs and to discourage opportunistic behavior during project renegotiations.

<p>Aim. The aim of this study was to examine the impacts of nurses' psychological capital and managerial support, plus specific safety interventions (managerial safety priorities, safety training satisfaction), on nurses' in-role safety performance.</p>
<p>Background. Most hospitals in industrialized countries have adopted selective (often the least costly) aspects of safety, usually related to safety policies. However, patient safety remains a challenge in many countries. Research shows that training can be used to upskill employees in psychological capital, with statistically significant organizational and employee benefits, but this area is under-researched in nursing.</p>
<p>Design. Data were collected using a survey-based, self-report strategy. The emerging patterns of data were then compared with the findings of previous research.</p>
<p>Methods. Quantitative survey data were collected during 2014 from 242 nurses working in six Australian hospitals. Two models were tested and analysed using covariance-based Structural Equation Modelling.</p>
<p>Results. Psychological capital and safety training satisfaction were important predictors of nurses' in-role safety performance and as predictors of nurses' perceptions of whether management implements what it espouses about safety ('managerial safety priorities'). Managerial support accounted for just under a third of psychological capital and together, psychological capital and managerial support, plus satisfaction with safety training, were important to nurses' perceptions of in-role safety performance.</p>
<p>Conclusion. Organizations are likely to benefit from upskilling nurses and their managers to increase nurses' psychological capital and managerial support, which then will enhance nurses' satisfaction with training and in-role safety performance perceptions.</p>"

<p>We investigate the implications of imperfect best response in combination with different assumptions about correct (QRE) or incorrect beliefs (Quantal-Gambler's Fallacy or QGF) - in the alternating offer multilateral bargaining game. We prove that a QRE of this game exists and characterize the unique solution to the proposer's problem that is, the proposal observed most frequently in a QRE. We structurally estimate this model on data from laboratory experiments, and show that it explains behavior better than the model with perfect best response: receivers vote probabilistically; proposers allocate resources mostly within a minimum winning coalition of legislators but do not fully exploit their bargaining power. Incorporating history-dependent beliefs about the future distribution of proposal power into the QRE model (QGF) leads to an even better match with the data, as this model implies slightly lower shares to the proposer, maintaining similar or higher frequencies of minimum winning coalitions and similar voting behavior.

<p>Extant literature on foreign entry increasingly recognizes firms' heterogeneity as a potential reason for inconsistency in results on the establishment mode choice, that is, whether and under which conditions firms should choose to enter a new country through a greenfield investment or an acquisition. Our study contributes to this debate by identifying family ownership and family involvement in management as potential powerful sources of such heterogeneity. Integrating international business studies with both corporate finance literature on family firms and recent contributions from the Socio Emotional Wealth perspective on family ownership, we claim that, due to greater risk aversion and lower access to information, the family involvement both in the firm ownership and management leads to a higher propensity towards greenfield initiatives (vs acquisitions). However, we also find that such a propensity decreases with international experience especially in family-owned firms given the greater ability of professionalized management to overcome family-related concerns on making acquisitions. Our analysis on 1045 foreign initiatives undertaken by 311 Italian family and non-family firms between 2003 and 2013 confirms our expectations, indicating family ownership as a significant driver of firms' international strategies.</p>"

<p>Working on the top 100 Interbrand world corporate brands dataset over the 10-years period 2001-10, we analyze the relative positioning of country brands as derived from the structural characteristics of the corresponding portfolios of top corporate brands. We find that the structural complexity of both sector and country variables are not correlated with brand equity. Moreover, we apply an innovative ANN methodology, AutoCM, to build the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the multi-dimensional similarities among the top corporate brands structures at country level, and carry out a further related analysis in terms of the so called Maximum Regular Graph (MRG). We find that while the USA dominates the ranking of top brands at a global level, it does not have a central positioning in the MST and MRG, whereas Germany and other European and Far-Eastern countries do. We show how these results may have significant implications for the strategic intelligence analysis of country and corporate brands, and of their inter-relatedness. Moreover, we illustrate how AutoCM qualifies as a new computational approach that usefully expands the toolbox of scholars and analysts in corporate and country branding in a relevant, as yet unexplored direction.

<p>Recent research emphasizes the importance of information feedback in situations of recurrent decisions and strategic interaction, showing how it affects the uncertainty that underlies selfconfirming equilibrium (e.g., Battigalli et al., 2015, Fudenberg and Kamada, 2015). Here, we discuss in detail several properties of this key feature of recurrent interaction and derive relationships. This allows us to elucidate different notions of selfconfirming equilibrium, showing how they are related to each other given the properties of information feedback. In particular, we focus on Maxmin selfconfirming equilibrium, which assumes extreme ambiguity aversion, and we compare it with the partially-specified-probabilities (PSP) equilibrium of Lehrer (2012). Assuming that players can implement any randomization, symmetric Maxmin selfconfirming equilibrium exists under either ""observable payoffs,"" or ""separable feedback."" The latter assumption makes this equilibrium concept essentially equivalent to PSP-equilibrium. If observability of payoffs holds as well, then these equilibrium concepts collapse to mixed Nash equilibrium. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Evidence is growing that forms of incivility-e.g. aggressive and disrespectful behaviors, harassment, hate speech and outrageous claims-are spreading in the population of social networking sites' (SNS) users. Online social networks such as Facebook allow users to regularly interact with known and unknown others, who can behave either politely or rudely. This leads individuals not only to learn and adopt successful strategies for using the site, but also to condition their own behavior on that of others. Using a mean field approach, we define anevolutionary game framework to analyse the dynamics of civil and uncivil ways of interaction in online social networks and their consequences for collective welfare. Agents can choose to interact with others-politely or rudely-in SNS, or to opt out from online social networks to protect themselves from incivility. We find that, when the initial share of the population of polite users reaches a critical level, civility becomes generalized if its payoff increases more than that of incivility with the spreading of politeness in online interactions. Otherwise, the spreading of self-protective behaviors to cope with online incivility can lead the economyto non-socially optimal stationary states.</p>"

<p>This paper examines the evolution of financial supervision as a policy tool over the last three decades, with a focus on the issues raised by the Global Crisis. It considers a sample of advanced and emerging economies to discuss the four main questions debated in the literature, and addressed in the economic policy arena: the architecture of supervision, the role of the central bank as supervisor, the governance of supervision, and financial supervision vs. the internationalization of finance. Our survey finds that, on each of these issues, theory and practice do not offer clear-cut answers and unambiguous optimal solutions. At the same time, the most promising approach is to tackle financial supervision as a principal-agent problem, where economics and political economy approaches must be used in combination to improve both positive and normative analyses of supervisory governance.</p>"

<p>Aim of this study was to compare a minimally fluoroscopic radiofrequency catheter ablation with conventional fluoroscopy-guided ablation for supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) in terms of ionizing radiation exposure for patient and operator and to estimate patients' lifetime attributable risks associated with such exposure.</p>
<p>We performed a prospective, multicentre, randomized controlled trial in six electrophysiology (EP) laboratories in Italy. A total of 262 patients undergoing EP studies for SVT were randomized to perform a minimally fluoroscopic approach (MFA) procedure with the EnSite(TM)NavX(TM) navigation system or a conventional approach (ConvA) procedure. The MFA was associated with a significant reduction in patients' radiation dose (0 mSv, iqr 0-0.08 vs. 8.87 mSv, iqr 3.67-22.01; P < 0.00001), total fluoroscopy time (0 s, iqr 0-12 vs. 859 s, iqr 545-1346; P < 0.00001), and operator radiation dose (1.55 vs. 25.33 A mu S per procedure; P < 0.001). In the MFA group, X-ray was not used at all in 72% (96/134) of cases. The acute success and complication rates were not different between the two groups (P = ns). The reduction in patients' exposure shows a 96% reduction in the estimated risks of cancer incidence and mortality and an important reduction in estimated years of life lost and years of life affected. Based on economic considerations, the benefits of MFA for patients and professionals are likely to justify its additional costs.</p>
<p>This is the first multicentre randomized trial showing that a MFA in the ablation of SVTs dramatically reduces patients' exposure, risks of cancer incidence and mortality, and years of life affected and lost, keeping safety and efficacy.</p>

<p>We propose that cross-listing is associated with better environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, because cross-listed firms adopt ESG, practices to mitigate the liability of foreignness (LOF) in foreign financial markets. Institutionalization processes have made ESG practices important for managing challenges associated with the LOF. With tests involving the S&P Global 1200 index, we show that cross-listing improves corporate social responsibility (CSR; i.e., social and environmental dimensions) but not corporate governance. The effects of cross-listing on CSR also depend on investor protection regimes of listing destinations: Stronger regimes correspond with poorer CSR performance, suggesting that they limit managerial discretion.

<p>This paper provides an analysis of the link between the oil market and the U.S. stock market returns at the aggregate as well as industry levels. We empirically model oil price changes as driven by speculative demand shocks along with consumption demand and supply shocks in the oil market. We also take into account in our model all the factors that affect stock market price movements over and above the oil market, in order to quantify the pure effect of oil price shocks on returns. The results show that stock returns respond to oil price shocks differently, depending on the causes behind the shocks. Impulse response analysis suggests that consumption demand shocks are the most relevant drivers of the stock market return, relative to other oil market driven shocks. Industry level analysis is performed to control for the heterogeneity of the responses of returns to oil price changes. The results show that both cost side and demand side effects of oil price shocks matter for the responses of industries to oil price shocks. However, the main driver of the variation in industries' returns is the shock to aggregate stock market. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we assess the SIDS' pattern towards energy sustainability. Second, we try to understand the macro factors that drive policy-makers in setting the optimal framework for investments in renewable energy sources. The empirical analysis is performed on a large dataset of 136 countries and 41 variables observed in the time span 2000-2011. Countries analyzed include a sample of 12 SIDS (Bahrain, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Fiji Islands, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Maldives, Mauritius, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Trinidad and Tobago) distributed worldwide. Due to the large number of variables collected and their high degree of collinearity, the first step of the analysis concerns the implementation of a Principal Component Analysis in order to extract factors explaining the majority of variation of the original variables. In the second step, three different scenarios of modeling are designed to examine the key factors promoting RES investments. In a first scenario, we employ a pooled regression model, in the second a Fixed Effect model and, in the third, a Random Effect model is estimated. The main results of empirical analysis could be unexpected at first sight. They show, in fact, that SIDS are not on a energy sustainability path. As in the case of other developing countries, policy-makers prefer to use resources to improve economic aspects of development leaving behind issues related to the environmental protection, the use of RES and sustainability. In order to improve economic and environmental resilience of SIDS a synergy between local governments and international organizations to promote the investments in RES is needed. Moreover, an energy plan that clearly supports the generation of energy from RES is recommended. Finally policy-makers should strength their commitment in raising population's awareness toward a green energy generation. Such synergic interventions will allow SIDS to achieve a more sustainable development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Twenty-one studies reporting data on overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP), were included in a meta-analysis. The pooled post-TARE OS was 63% (95% CI: 56-70%) and 27% (95% CI: 21-33%) at 1- and 3-years respectively in intermediate stage HCC, whereas OS was 37% (95% CI: 26-50%) and 13% (95% CI: 9-18%) at the same time intervals in patients with sufficient liver function (Child-Pugh A-B7) but with an advanced HCC because of the presence of portal vein thrombosis. When an intermediate and advanced case-mix was considered, OS was 58% (95% CI: 48-67%) and 17% (95% CI: 12-23%) at 1-and 3-years respectively. As for TTP, only four studies reported data: the observed progression probability was 56% (95% CI: 41-70%) and 73% (95% CI: 56-87%) at 1 and 2 years respectively. The safety analysis, focused on the risk of liver decompensation after TARE, revealed a great variability, from 0-1% to more than 36% events, influenced by the number of procedures, patient Child-Pugh stage and treatment duration.</p>

It uses the anthropometric and occupational data included in the records of the general conscription carried out during the Napoleonic invasion. The findings are interpreted in light of the recent contributions regarding the evolution of the economy and industrial output of central Spain during the second half of the eighteenth century. Significant differences can be observed between different professions and economic sectors, largely explained by income levels, the possible selection for some occupations in accordance with physical characteristics, and access to animal proteins. Furthermore, the data also reveals an overall decrease in height and an increase in inequality between professions during the period.</p>"

<p>We propose a simple model of non-exclusive financial advice in which two households rely on a self-interested (common) expert to make their investment choices. There is only one source of risk, and the expert is privately informed about the risky asset's volatility. When monetary transfers are unenforceable, we show that investors may delegate their investment decisions to the expert. When doing so, however, they impose restrictions on her choices which crucially depend on whether the expert perceives investors' asset allocations as complements or as substitutes. Finally, we analyze the implications of non-exclusivity in financial advice on investment behavior and welfare, and highlight a set of novel testable implications.</p>"

<p>Investigating the factors that drive differences in preferences for health insurance products among rural populations is a relevant policy issue that has so far received little attention. This study used a discrete choice experiment to explore heterogeneity of preferences for a prospective micro-health insurance (MHI) product in Malawi. Through an extensive qualitative study, six attributes, each associated with three levels, were derived and used to construct a D-efficient design. The attributes included unit of enrollment, management structure, health service benefit package, copayment levels, transportation coverage and monthly premium. The experiment was interviewer administered to a stratified random sample of household heads and their spouse(s). Using mixed logit and generalized multinomial logit models, respondent characteristics were interacted with MHI attributes to explore heterogeneity of preferences. The results showed that those in the higher age group (a parts per thousand yen55 years) and those from households with higher household expenditure had significantly higher preferences for comprehensive and medium benefit packages than for a basic package. Those from households that incurred any healthcare expenditure within the past 4 weeks had lower preferences for the core family as a unit of enrollment than the individual, and higher preferences for coverage of transport costs. Women and non-micro-finance members had higher preferences for 25% copayment than for 50% copayment. There was evidence of scale heterogeneity signifying that the observed preference variations could have resulted from scale and variance differences, rather than real variations in the taste of respondents. To attract the relatively older and wealthier, prospective MHI should offer comprehensive health services benefit packages. Premium exemptions or subsidies should also be offered to the poor. Lower copayments can provide an incentive for women and non-micro-finance members, whilst coverage of transport costs can also attract those with recent history of incurring out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure to accept MHI.</p>"

<p>We examine asset allocation decisions under smooth ambiguity aversion when an investor has a prior degree of belief in the domestic capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Different from a Bayesian approach, the investor separately relies on the conditional distribution of returns and on the posterior over parameters to make decisions, rather than on the predictive distribution of returns that integrates priors and likelihood information. We find that in the perspective of U.S. investors, ambiguity aversion generates strong home bias in equity holdings, regardless of beliefs in the CAPM or risk aversion. Results become stronger under regime-switching investment opportunities.</p>"

<p>Offshoring offers managers the promise of substantial economic benefits, but also comes with the risk of increased complexity and coordination challenges. We argue that offshoring firms must accumulate architectural knowledge to keep the cost of coordination of the geographically separated activities at bay. Based on a simulation model that examines the performance implications of firms' learning strategies when offshoring, we show that such knowledge accumulation can be achieved through either a home-based or a host-based learning strategy. Our analysis suggests that the relative performance of these two strategies depends on nontrivial interactions among the costs of communication, the distance to the offshoring location, and the level of noise in the firm's performance function. In particular, the difficulties of interpreting performance signals in noisy situations suggest that there are benefits of making changes to the configuration after the offshoring implementation (host-based learning). In contrast, when coordination costs and distance dominate, the strategy of gearing the organization for offshoring prior to separating them across country borders prevails (home-based learning). Thus, by formalizing these two learning strategies for acquiring architectural knowledge in offshoring, we show that important contingencies can lead to significant performance trade-offs in the search for new organizational configurations that span international borders.</p>"

<p>Research Question/Issue: Considering the recent financial and economic crisis as a unique exogenous shock, our study investigates the financial performance of family-controlled firms in ""steady-state"" conditions as opposed to situations of severe economic distress. In addition, we focus our attention within family firms in order to tease out the leadership (family or non-family CEO) and family ownership (family ownership concentration or dispersion) conditions that allow some governance arrangements to perform better than others during an economic downturn.</p>
<p>Research Findings/Insights: Examining the entire population of Italian industrial family and non-family publicly listed companies over the period 2002-2012, we observe a significantly and consistently better performance of family-controlled firms during the financial and economic crisis, a finding that proves to be robust to several analytical specifications, as well as to different performance measures (ROA, ROE). Then, focusing on family firms only, we find that mixed configurations (family CEOs with relatively lower family ownership concentration) produce better performance in the face of an external hazard.</p>
<p>Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study confirms the pivotal assumption of the socioemotional wealth perspective that the advantages of family firms showup exactly when ownership is at stake. Our results also add to the growing literature on the resilience of family firms, showing that they are more able than others to absorb exogenous shocks.</p>
<p>Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our findings suggest the importance of crafting governance structures well in advance of a crisis. Our research speaks to policymakers, indicating the importance of family firms for national economies, and the political opportunity to sustain their growth and managerial development.</p>"

<p>Manuscript Type: Empirical</p>
<p>Research Question/Issue: Although non-family managers (NFMs) can be expected to influence firm performance, this issue is largely under-investigated. In this study, we examine how diversity inside the non-family component of the top management team (non-family team, or NFT) influences family firm performance. More specifically, we investigate the performance effects of three specific sources of NFT diversity (NFT size; NFT tenure diversity; and NFT dominant functional diversity).</p>
<p>Research Findings/Insights: The analysis of 584 survey responses by top managers representing 97 complete NFTs (and the related top management teams, TMTs) out of the top 500 family-controlled firms in the Italian furniture industry indicates that (1) NFT-dominant functional diversity improves firm performance; (2) a U-shaped relationship exists between NFT tenure diversity and family firm performance; (3) an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between NFT size and family firm performance. Additionally, we show that the relation between non-family manager characteristics and firm performance is moderated by family dominance in the entire TMT, that is, the proportion of family to non-family managers.</p>
<p>Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our results call for further exploration regarding the demographic characteristics of nonfamily managers and their effect on the performance of family firms. In this way, they have several implications for the family business literature, contributing to the growing debate on the socio-emotionalwealth (SEW) perspective of family firms' behaviors. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of better contextualizing research on strategic leadership and strategic leaders.</p>
<p>Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our study suggests that the choice of outsiders should take into account not only their ""market value"" and reputation, but also the attributes of other NFMs among the company's executives, providing guidance to family owners in their decisions about professionalization.</p>"

<p>We present a model of stereotypes based on Kahneman and Tversky's representativeness heuristic. A decision maker assesses a target group by overweighting its representative types, defined as the types that occur more frequently in that group than in a baseline reference group. Stereotypes formed this way contain a ""kernel of truth"": they are rooted in true differences between groups. Because stereotypes focus on differences, they cause belief distortions, particularly when groups are similar. Stereotypes are also context dependent: beliefs about a group depend on the characteristics of the reference group. In line with our predictions, beliefs in the lab about abstract groups and beliefs in the field about political groups are context dependent and distorted in the direction of representative types.</p>"

<p>Perceived similarity is influenced by both taxonomic and thematic relations. Assessing taxonomic relations requires comparing individual features of objects whereas assessing thematic relations requires exploring how objects functionally interact. These processes appear to relate to different thinking styles: abstract thinking and a global focus may be required to explore functional interactions whereas attention to detail and a local focus may be required to compare specific features. In four experiments we explored this idea by assessing whether a preference for taxonomic or thematic relations could be created by inducing a local or global perceptual processing style. Experiments 1-3 primed processing style via a perceptual task and used a choice task to examine preference for taxonomic (versus thematic) relations. Experiment 4 induced processing style and examined the effect on similarity ratings for pairs of taxonomic and thematically related items.

<p>Since the Keynesian revolution in economics, a standard part of the profession's analytical framework, and an argument for government support for investment, has been the multiplier concept. This classical multiplier works through consumption in an equilibrium model. Our contention is that there is also an entrepreneurial multiplier that works directly through investment by incentivizing or forcing investments in innovation in a dynamic, disequilibrium model. These investments have been analyzed as spill-overs, or responses to bottlenecks, or Schumpeterian examples of emulation. We suggest that the surges of innovation in capitalism were even broader than Schumpeter did, and that they can best be explored using a multiplier paradigm. We start that exploration by briefly examining selected patterns of entrepreneurship in the first, second, and third industrial revolutions. Our emphasis is on the sequences of innovations; the manner in which they are multiplied; and their economic, cultural, and political consequences. We delve into the first Industrial Revolution in New England and in Lombardy, Italy; the second Industrial Revolution in the United States and France, and the third Industrial Revolution in America and Europe. In all three of these dramatic capitalist transitions, there is evidence of the entrepreneurial multiplier at work, broadening, deepening, and extending the impact of the major innovations.</p>"

<p>Measures of sensitivity and uncertainty have become an integral part of risk analysis. Many such measures have a conditional probabilistic structure, for which a straightforward Monte Carlo estimation procedure has a double-loop form. Recently, a more efficient single-loop procedure has been introduced, and consistency of this procedure has been demonstrated separately for particular measures, such as those based on variance, density, and information value. In this work, we give a unified proof of single-loop consistency that applies to any measure satisfying a common rationale. This proof is not only more general but invokes less restrictive assumptions than heretofore in the literature, allowing for the presence of correlations among model inputs and of categorical variables. We examine numerical convergence of such an estimator under a variety of sensitivity measures. We also examine its application to a published medical case study.</p>"

<p>We analyze the contribution of credit spread, house and stock price shocks to the US economy based on a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model. We find that the contribution of financial shocks to gross domestic product growth fluctuates from about 20% in normal times to more than 50% during the Great Recession. The Great Recession and the subsequent weak recovery can largely be traced back to negative housing shocks. Housing shocks have become more important for the real economy since the early 2000s, and negative housing shocks are more important than positive ones. Unexpected increases in credit spreads have not been deflationary recently. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

We argue that different explanations should be invoked to understand the early modern growth of inequality throughout Europe since several factors conspired to make for a society in which it was much easier for inequality to rise than to fall. Although long-term trends in economic inequality were apparently similar across the continent, divergence occurred in terms of inequality extraction ratios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

<p>We introduce a dependent Bayesian nonparametric model for the probabilistic modeling of membership of subgroups in a community based on partially replicated data. The focus here is on species-by-site data, that is, community data where observations at different sites are classified in distinct species. Our aim is to study the impact of additional covariates, for instance, environmental variables, on the data structure, and in particular on the community diversity. To this end, we introduce dependence a priori across the covariates and show that it improves posterior inference. We use a dependent version of the Griffiths-Engen-McCloskey distribution defined via the stick-breaking construction. This distribution is obtained by transforming a Gaussian process whose covariance function controls the desired dependence. The resulting posterior distribution is sampled by Markov chain Monte Carlo. We illustrate the application of our model to a soil microbial data set acquired across a hydrocarbon contamination gradient at the site of a fuel spill in Antarctica. This method allows for inference on a number of quantities of interest in ecotoxicology, such as diversity or effective concentrations, and is broadly applicable to the general problem of community response to environmental variables.</p>"

<p>Eating a food reduces the desire to eat more of that food. General-process theories of motivation posit that eating a food also increases the motivation to eat other foods-an effect known as cross-stimulus sensitization. The authors propose that eating a food selectively sensitizes consumers to its complements rather than to all foods. Eating a food activates a goal to consume foods that consumers perceive to be well paired with the consumed food. In five experiments, imagined and actual consumption of a food sensitized participants to complementary foods but not to unrelated or semantically associated foods. These findings suggest that cross-stimulus sensitization is more specific and predictable than previously assumed. The authors identify goal activation as the process through which cross-stimulus sensitization occurs and can be instilled.</p>"

<p>Purpose This paper reviews and adapts the methodology ""Guide on the methodology for carrying out cost-benefit analysis"" prepared by the European Commission (EC). It is specifically tailored to the assessment of an innovative rail freight service, and its application in the context of a number of potential service areas (principally pan European) in Europe. The SPECTRUM service is an innovative rail freight concept for the transport of low density high value (LDHV) goods.</p>
<p>Methods The methodology is primarily based on the ""Guide to cost-benefit analysis of investment projects"" of the European Commission. The cost definition takes input from a Life Cycle Cost analysis and applies a series of conversion factors. The benefits have been estimated considering the user's surplus, i.e. the difference between Generalised Logistic Costs (GLC) borne by transport/logistics operators (and more in general freight transport service users) when using the SPECTRUM service and GLC connected to ""preshift"" mode, i.e. road or traditional rail; and the difference in external costs generated by freight transport activities connected to externalities such as air pollution and climate change, noise, accidents, and other externalities (up-and down-stream processes, nature and landscape, biodiversity losses, soil and water pollution, congestion).</p>
<p>Results The adapted methodology has proven capable of representing the multiple effects resulting from the theoretical introduction of an innovative rail service in the freight transport sector - accounting for the differential impacts compared to the baseline scenario solutions. The logical articulation of the analysis is flexible; two specific estimation schemes (the estimation of ad hoc unit parameters for the external costs and ad hoc approach for using GLC as proxies of users' surplus in a scenario where the introduction of the innovative service modifies the modal split of freight transport between different solutions) can be applied to other territorial contexts. It may also be used to evaluate other types of freight transport services, provided that some unit data can be retrieved, which pertain to site-specific cost of infrastructures, average speeds and rates of different transport solutions, costs of personnel and other operating costs.</p>"

<p>The study presented in this paper aimed at checking whether companies that embed information and communication technologies (ICT)-enabled time performance into their product offering can achieve better economic outcomes from technology adoption. Indeed, it is still questionable whether technology adoption results in a superior profitability, especially if such an improvement is achieved through the use of functional ICT applications. In this study, we assume that a better alignment among ICT investments, improvements of the logistics process and the value proposition of the firm can lead towards a superior economic performance. A survey was conducted and 180 usable questionnaires were collected from companies engaged in the electronics and vehicle manufacturing industries. Data were analysed through the structural equation modeling approach. The results show that improvements in speed and dependability, achieved through technology adoption, can lead to a better economic performance if they are embedded into superior after-sales services and/or into an improved product offering.</p>"

<p>The problem of the evaluation and estimation of the mean density of random closed sets in R-d with integer Hausdorff dimension 0 < n < d, is of great interest in many different scientific and technological fields. Among the estimators of the mean density available in literature, the so-called ""Minkowski content""- based estimator reveals its benefits in applications in the non-stationary cases. We introduce here a multivariate version of such estimator, and we study its asymptotical properties by means of large and moderate deviation results. In particular we prove that the estimator is strongly consistent and asymptotically Normal. Furthermore we also provide confidence regions for the mean density of the involved random closed set in m >= 1 distinct points x(1), ... , x(m) is an element of R-d.</p>"

In most cases the variability around the average aggregate behaviour does not vanish asymptotically: this requires to accompany usual macroeconomic mean predictions with some measure of uncertainty, which is readily yielded by the adopted Bayesian nonparametric approach. Moreover, we discover that the extent of the asymptotic variability is the result of the interaction between the rate at which the economy creates new sectors and the concavity of returns in sector specific technologies.</p>"

<p>A simple approach for modeling multivariate extremes is to consider the vector of component-wise maxima and their max-stable distributions. The extremal dependence can be inferred by estimating the angular measure or, alternatively, the Pickands dependence function. We propose a nonparametric Bayesian model that allows, in the bivariate case, the simultaneous estimation of both functional representations through the use of polynomials in the Bernstein form. The constraints required to provide a valid extremal dependence are addressed in a straightforward manner, by placing a prior on the coefficients of the Bernstein polynomials which gives probability one to the set of valid functions. The prior is extended to the polynomial degree, making our approach nonparametric. Although the analytical expression of the posterior is unknown, inference is possible via a trans-dimensional MCMC scheme. We show the efficiency of the proposed methodology by means of a simulation study. The extremal behaviour of log-returns of daily exchange rates between the Pound Sterling vs the U.S. Dollar and the Pound Sterling vs the Japanese Yen is analysed for illustrative purposes.</p>"

<p>Being lauded is not the same as being liked; celebrated products that win awards frequently fail to stand out in terms of commercial success. This work documents how creative control, the extent to which the same entity takes responsibility for all stages of the creative process, impacts which products are singled out for recognition but does not play a comparable role in determining what consumers like and thus purchase. Using real-world data, study 1 demonstrates how songs by performers who write their own material are more likely to garner acclaim but do not excel in terms of sales. Study 2 replicates the pattern of results in the lab. Study 3 reproduces the effect in a new domain (beer) using different measures of recognition. Study 4 shows creative authenticity, the extent to which a product is considered a faithful execution of its creator's vision, mediates the effect of creative control on recognition. Further, study 4 highlights the contingent role played by the perceived trustworthiness of the creator on this relationship.

<p>Donation of human tissues for research and ELSI (ethical, legal, and social issues) of biobanking are increasingly debated issues. While several studies have highlighted patients' concerns, little is known about opinions and preferences of healthy potential donors. Further investigations in this respect may allow communication procedures tailored to participants' needs. Based on the Italian Twin Registry, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among twins who had not yet donated biological samples for research. The objective was to assess the importance these potential donors attributed to specific procedures and pieces of communication related to research biobanking. A self-administered questionnaire was constructed and validated. Items were as follows: potential agreement on use of biological samples for research; knowledge of biobanks; and importance given to privacy protection and to communication of general and individual tests results, study objectives, type and amount of participant involvement, location and duration of sample storage, and benefits and potential risks. Multivariate analysis was performed to estimate the association of these items with sociodemographic factors as well as with perceived health status and chronic or long-term diseases. The questionnaire was mailed to 4894 twins aged 18-65 (response rate 34%). One-third of subjects already knew about biobanks, 52% had some knowledge, and 20% were uninformed. A majority expressed unconditional agreement to sample use for research. Only 6% of respondents considered privacy protection not important in research biobanking. Knowledge of biobanks predicted attention to most of the issues. Higher education was associated with more frequent concern about type and amount of involvement, but less frequent concern about place and time of storage, and presence of benefits. Women were more attentive to research biobanking. This study supports the need of procedures tailored on different donors' concerns and highlights the social value of population biobanks. Furthermore, the results call for greater efforts in the promotion of research biobanking.</p>"

<p>Over the last 15 years, business model innovation (BMI) has gained an increasing amount of attention in management research and among practitioners. The emerging BMI literature addresses an important phenomenon but lacks theoretical underpinning, and empirical inquiry is not cumulative. Thus, a concerted research effort seems warranted. Accordingly, we take stock of the extant literature on BMI. We identify and analyze 150 peer-reviewed scholarly articles on BMI published between 2000 and 2015. We provide the first comprehensive systematic review of the BMI literature, include a critical assessment of these research efforts, and offer suggestions for future research. We argue that the literature faces problems with respect to construct clarity and has gaps with respect to the identification of antecedent conditions, contingencies, and outcomes. We identify important avenues for future research and show how the complexity theory, innovation, and other streams of literature can help overcome many of the gaps in the BMI literature.</p>"

<p>Countries craft their regulations in a specific national context. When foreign exporters apply this regulation to achieve market access, it becomes subject to a global array of implementation conditions. Several World Trade aganization (WTO) disputes have ruled that regulation failed to acknowledge the conditions of foreign exporters. The WTO Appellate Body has suggested that comparing conditions or 'situations' is part of not discriminating between foreign and domestic products, but the implications remain vague. In fact, pulling too hard on this thread could unravel the non-discrimination principle as it leads to its inherent contradiction: regulation will never treat all trade partners exactly the same precisely because of their diverse conditions. Further, suggesting that it should put a huge undue burden on regulators: deep integration run amok. Key WTO environment and development controversies centre on how to acknowledge differences between countries' situations and still achieve the formal equality that the system promises. The case law on situational discrimination feeds into these debates. This article proposes that the focus should be on how different situations influence the comparative effectiveness of a regulation in meeting its goal, an approach which delimits and clarifies.</p>"

<p>Biases in meeting opportunities have been recently shown to play a key role for the emergence of homophily in social networks (see Currarini et al., 2009). The aim of this paper is to provide a simple microfoundation of these biases in a model where the size and type-composition of the meeting pools are shaped by agents' socialization decisions. In particular, agents either inbreed (direct search only to similar types) or outbreed (direct search to population at large). When outbreeding is costly, this is shown to induce stark equilibrium behavior of a threshold type: agents ""inbreed"" (i.e. mostly meet their own type) if, and only if, their group is above certain size. We show that this threshold equilibrium generates patterns of in-group and cross-group ties that are consistent with empirical evidence of homophily in two paradigmatic instances: high school friendships and interethnic marriages.

<p>Research summary: This special issue of Strategic Management Journal was motivated by concern that the growing scope and diversity of the strategic management field creates the risk of incoherence and fragmentation and the belief that research reviews could contribute to synthesis and integration. In this introductory essay, we address the expanding domain of strategic management, consider where its boundaries lie, identify the forces engendering fragmentation, and discuss how this special issue-and research reviews in general-can assist convergence within the field of strategy. We conclude by addressing the potential for integration more broadly in relation to the theories we deploy, the phenomena we investigate, and cohesiveness of our scholarly community. Managerial summary: The expanding domain of strategic management reflects the widening range of strategic issues that practising managers face. However, the fragmentation that has accompanied this broadening scope impedes the usefulness of strategic management research in guiding strategic decision making. We argue that reviews of strategic management research, such as those included within this special issue, can support the accumulation of an integrated, empirically-validated knowledge base which is essential to informing management practice.

<p>Behavioral bias - loss aversion - can explain monetary policy inertia in setting interest rates. Economic literature has tended to explain inertia in monetary pollcymaking in terms of frictions and delays, or has stressed the role of governance rules. We introduce.a new driver of inertia, independent from frictions and central bank governance settings. While the degree of conservatism doesn't necessarily produce monetary inertia, we show that introducing loss aversion in individual behavior influences the stance of monetary policy under three different but convergent perspectives. First of all, a Moderation Effect can emerge, i.e. the number of pigeons increases. At the same time also a Hysteresis Effect can become relevant, whereby both doves and hawks soften their attitudes. Finally a SmoothingEffect tends to stabilize the number of pigeons. Together, the three effects consistently cause higher monetary policy inertia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Banks use internal models to optimize risk weights and better account for the specific risk of each asset. As the choice of risk weights affects the regulatory capital ratio, economic theory suggests that banks with a higher cost of equity should be more aggressive in reducing risk weights. We consider a large panel of international banks and find that, after controlling for a number of bank and country characteristics and contrary to what happens for a non-Basel II bank, for a Basel II bank a higher cost of equity is not associated with a higher ratio between risk-weighted assets and total assets. These results are obtained in the context of state-of-theart endogeneity-robust econometric procedures and across several specifications. We propose an indicator of risk weights saving and assess its impact on several performance measure during the 2008-2009 and the 2010-2012 crises. We find that for European banks not located in peripheral countries, a higher degree of RWA-saving is associated with more equity raising during the European crisis, more volatility, and lower distance-to-default. European banks located in peripheral countries engaged less strongly in RWA-saving than European banks located in core countries, and its impact on the various performance measures is almost nonexistent, except for a decrease in the distance-to-default.

By adopting a demand-side perspective, this paper addresses the implications of hybridity for strategic choices with products and businesses by focusing on the role of social business hybrids' customers. In the conceptual framework, social identity theory explains how hybridity generates both positive and negative demand-side externalities. Thus, hybridity can be a source of competitive advantage in the marketplace, but also create hurdles to firms' ability to scale up their business. Diversification represents a potential choice that simultaneously generates growth, preserves hybridity, and avoids negative demand-side externalities.

We use data from the home loan application processing operations of a Japanese bank to establish the phenomenon in the field. We document that increased task variety at a daily level is associated with lower levels of rule breaking in the form of violating corporate break time policies (Study 1). We further explore the relationship between task variety and rule breaking in three lab experiments, using different operationalizations of rule breaking (Studies 2, 3a, and 3b) and provide direct evidence for the mediating effect of deliberative thinking in this relationship (Studies 3a and 3b).

This new approach, which includes and improves various attempts by the recent literature, is very general and fulfills the essential requirement that the orbits lie entirely in the economically feasible interval. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for all solutions to be cycles lying entirely in the unit box. In addition, we study the period length of the cycles near the equilibrium and close to the boundary of the domain.

<p>Background: Intermittent catheterisation is the method of choice for the management of bladder dysfunctions. Different urinary catheters are available, but there is conflicting evidence on which type of catheter is best. The present study provides an objective evaluation of the clinical effectiveness of different subsets of urinary catheters.</p>
<p>Methods: A systematic literature review was performed for published RCTs regarding hydrophilic coated and PVC (standard) catheters for intermittent catheterisation. Separate meta-analyses were conducted to combine data on frequencies of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and haematuria. Two separate analyses were performed, including or excluding reused standard catheters.</p>
<p>Results: Seven studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. The meta-analyses exploring UTI frequencies showed a lower risk ratio associated with hydrophilic catheters in comparison to standard ones (RR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.94; p = 0.003). Results for the ""reuse"" scenario were consistent with the ones related to ""single-use"" scenario in terms of frequency of UTIs. The meta-analyses exploring haematuria were not able to demonstrate any statistically significant difference between hydrophilic catheters in comparison to standard ones.</p>
<p>Conclusions: The findings confirm previously reported benefits of hydrophilic catheters but a broader evaluation that takes into account also patient preferences, compliance of therapy, quality of life and costs would be needed to assess the economic sustainability of these advanced devices.</p>"

The shocks we estimate are large and correspond to well-known macroeconomic episodes such as the Great Moderation and the productivity slowdown. We compare our results to earlier estimates of ""long-run risks"" and assess the implications for asset pricing. Our estimates yield greater return predictability and a more volatile price-dividend ratio. In addition, we can explain a substantial fraction of cross-country variation in the equity premium.. An advantage of our approach, based on macroeconomic data alone, is that the parameter estimates cannot be viewed as backward engineered to fit asset pricing data.

A cost analysis has been performed to compare the standard embolization endovascular approach, performed postpartum in emergency settlement, with a novel proposed preventive embolization approach, and performed in election in selected high-risk patients before the delivery. Two groups have been compared: 46 patients (non-preventive group) and 67 patients (preventive group). The computation of the detailed costs derived from the real costs supported by the hospital, based on the regional tariff in the period considered. The total expense for the 46 patients of the non-preventive group was 640.551,84a,notsign (13.925,04a,notsign/patient); all of them received transfusions and 43.4 % underwent to hysterectomy; the total expense for the 67 patients of the preventive group was 509.720,59a,notsign (7.607,77a,notsign/ patient); 36 % required transfusions and 26 % underwent to hysterectomy. Overall, in the preventive group, there is a mean saving of 45 %, it else 6.317a,notsign/patient. In this sample, predelivery uterine artery embolization has proved to be a cost-effective procedure, reducing the length of the hospital stay and the number of transfers to the intensive care unit, in pregnants with placental implant anomalies.</p>"

<p>Background</p>
<p>Patterns of person-to-person contacts relevant for infectious diseases transmission are still poorly quantified in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where socio-demographic structures and behavioral attitudes are expected to be different from those of more developed countries.</p>
<p>Methods and Findings</p>
<p>We conducted a diary-based survey on daily contacts and time-use of individuals of different ages in one rural and one pen-urban site of Manicaland, Zimbabwe. A total of 2,490 diaries were collected and used to derive age-structured contact matrices, to analyze time spent by individuals in different settings, and to identify the key determinants of individuals' mixing patterns. Overall 10.8 contacts per person/day were reported, with a significant difference between the pen-urban and the rural site (11.6 versus 10.2). A strong age-assortativeness characterized contacts of school-aged children, whereas the high proportion of extended families and the young population age-structure led to a significant intergenerational mixing at older ages. Individuals spent on average 67% of daytime at home, 2% at work, and 9% at school. Active participation in school and work resulted the key drivers of the number of contacts and, similarly, household size, class size, and time spent at work influenced the number of home, school, and work contacts, respectively. We found that the heterogeneous nature of home contacts is critical for an epidemic transmission chain. In particular, our results suggest that, during the initial phase of an epidemic, about 50% of infections are expected to occur among individuals younger than 12 years and less than 20% among individuals older than 35 years.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>With the current work, we have gathered data and information on the ways through which individuals in SSA interact, and on the factors that mostly facilitate this interaction. Monitoring these processes is critical to realistically predict the effects of interventions on infectious diseases dynamics.</p>"

<p>This study explores the critical notion of how feasible it is to achieve long-term mitigation goals to limit global temperature change. It uses a model inter-comparison of three integrated assessment models (TIAM-Grantham, MESSAGE-GLOBIOM and WITCH) harmonized for socio-economic growth drivers using one of the new shared socio-economic pathways (SSP2), to analyse multiple mitigation scenarios aimed at different temperature changes in 2100, in order to assess the model outputs against a range of indicators developed so as to systematically compare the feasibility across scenarios. These indicators include mitigation costs and carbon prices, rates of emissions reductions and energy efficiency improvements, rates of deployment of key low-carbon technologies, reliance on negative emissions, and stranding of power generation assets. The results highlight how much more challenging the 2 degrees C goal is, when compared to the 2.5-4 degrees C goals, across virtually all measures of feasibility. Any delay in mitigation or limitation in technology options also renders the 2 degrees C goal much less feasible across the economic and technical dimensions explored. Finally, a sensitivity analysis indicates that aiming for less than 2 degrees C is even less plausible, with significantly higher mitigation costs and faster carbon price increases, significantly faster decarbonization and zero-carbon technology deployment rates, earlier occurrence of very significant carbon capture and earlier onset of global net negative emissions. Such a systematic analysis allows a more in-depth consideration of what realistic level of long-term temperature changes can be achieved and what adaptation strategies are therefore required.</p>"

<p>This article synthesizes the cross-disciplinary literature on government transparency. It systematically reviews research addressing the topic of government transparency published between 1990 and 2015. The review uses 187 studies to address three questions: (1) What forms of transparency has the literature identified? (2) What outcomes does the literature attribute to transparency? and (3) How successful is transparency in achieving those goals? In addressing these questions, the authors review six interrelated types of transparency and nine governance-and citizen-related outcomes of transparency. Based on the findings of the analysis, the authors outline an agenda for future research on government transparency and its effects that calls for more systematically investigating the ways in which contextual conditions shape transparency outcomes, replicating studies with varying methodologies, investigating transparency in neglected countries, and paying greater attention to understudied claims of transparency such as improved decision making and management.</p>"

<p>Many applications in risk analysis require the estimation of the dependence among multivariate maxima, especially in environmental sciences. Such dependence can be described by the Pickands dependence function of the underlying extreme-value copula. Here, a nonparametric estimator is constructed as the sample equivalent of a multivariate extension of the madogram. Shape constraints on the family of Pickands dependence functions are taken into account by means of a representation in terms of Bernstein polynomials. The large-sample theory of the estimator is developed and its finite-sample performance is evaluated with a simulation study. The approach is illustrated with a dataset of weekly maxima of hourly rainfall in France recorded from 1993 to 2011 at various weather stations all over the country. The stations are grouped into clusters of seven stations, where our interest is in the extremal dependence within each cluster. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>We examine the effect of the 2005 Banking Regulation Amendment Bill and the 2011 Banking Laws Amendment Bill proposals for removal of the 10 percent voting rights cap in Indian Banks. The 2011 Banking Laws Bill was first introduced in 2005, but lapsed with the dissolution of the 14th Lok Sabha. The Bill was passed in December 2012 and raised the voting cap in private sector banks from 10 to 26 percent. We present evidence that the removal of the voting cap enhances the value of votes of bank stocks by reducing the wedge between cash-flow and control rights, thus increasing monitoring and the probability of takeover. Post-deregulation analysis reveals that the passage of the Bill was followed by increasing blockholders' number and percentage of shares held in larger and government banks. Furthermore, a stronger negative relationship between banks' profitability and size, as well as share of non-performing loans is observed. This study makes an important contribution to the growing literature on the valuation impact and efficiency gains of liberalization of ownership restrictions in emerging markets, as well as the rich literature on corporate governance and control relating to the value of voting privilege in companies with disparate voting rights.

We show that this effect mostly occurs along an intensive margin, whereby financial imperfections distort the quality of existing exports to a given destination market.

<p>This paper investigates whether the gender of elected politicians affects political outcomes at the municipal level. Relying on Italian administrative data from 1991 to 2009, we are able to instrument the gender of elected politicians using an institutional exogenous change: a gender quota in the candidacy list enforced only in a subsample of municipalities and for a short period of time. While the gender of politicians does not affect the general 'quality of life', proxied by the internal migration rate, it does increase significantly both the efficacy of policies targeting women and households, proxied by the fertility rate, and the efficiency of the municipal administration, proxied by the actual size of the administrative bodies. These results, which are robust to several specifications and checks, suggest that affirmative action enhancing gender equality in political representation may be beneficial not only in terms of social justice but also from a political outcome perspective.</p>"

<p>Background: Cancer may cause financial difficulties, but its impact in countries with public health systems is unknown. We evaluated the association of financial difficulties with clinical outcomes of cancer patients enrolled in academic clinical trials performed within the Italian public health system.</p>
<p>Patients and methods: Data were pooled from 16 prospective multicentre trials in lung, breast or ovarian cancer, using the EORTC quality of life (QOL) C30 questionnaire. Question 28 scores financial difficulties related to disease or treatment in four categories from 'not at all' to 'very much'. We defined financial burden (FB) as any financial difficulty reported at baseline questionnaire, and financial toxicity (FT) as score worsening in a subsequent questionnaire. We investigated (i) the association of FB with clinical outcomes (survival, global QOL response [questions 29/30] and severe toxicity), and (ii) the association of FT with survival. Multivariable analyses were performed using logistic regression models or the Cox model adjusting for trial, gender, age, region and period of enrolment, baseline global QOL and, where appropriate, FB and global QOL response. Results are reported as odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</p>
<p>Results: At baseline 26% of the 3670 study patients reported FB, significantly correlated with worse baseline global QOL. FB was not associated with risks of death (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85-1.04, P = 0.23) and severe toxicity (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76-1.06, P = 0.19) but was predictive of a higher chance of worse global QOL response (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08-1.70, P = 0.009). During treatment, 2735 (74.5%) patients filled in subsequent questionnaires and 616 (22.5%) developed FT that was significantly associated with an increased risk of death (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05-1.37, P = 0.007). Several sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Even in a public health system, financial difficulties are associated with relevant cancer patients outcomes like QOL and survival.</p>"

<p>While rules of origin (ROOs) for goods have been thoroughly discussed, similar rules for services remain nascent and have attracted insufficient scholarly attention to date. Despite their crucial role in determining the existence of trade in services and granting preferential treatment, current ROOs for services bear serious limitations as they are tied to the defectious approach of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). This article aims to examine the main strands of thought on this topic over the past two decades to illustrate the necessity of a new approach. It starts by affirming the importance of ROOs for services in the context of new patterns of trade. Next, it demonstrates how the GATS-based approach has brought progress in both rule-making practice and academic research to a standstill. By revisiting the 'substantial transformation' criterion, it then reveals the possibility of importing certain concepts from the sphere of goods to that of services and suggesting that some hints for the discussion should be found in other fields of law. Finally, it comes up with the recommendation that origin rules for services should be designed bottom-up and sector-specific.</p>"

<p>OBJECTIVE: Infectious disease spread depends on contact rates between infectious and susceptible individuals. Transmission models are commonly informed using empirically collected contact data, but the relevance of different contact types to transmission is still not well understood. Some studies select contacts based on a single characteristic such as proximity (physical/non-physical), location, duration or frequency. This study aimed to explore whether clusters of contacts similar to each other across multiple characteristics could better explain disease transmission.</p>
<p>METHODS: Individual contact data from the POLYMOD survey in Poland, Great Britain, Belgium, Finland and Italy were grouped into clusters by the k medoids clustering algorithm with a Manhattan distance metric to stratify contacts using all four characteristics. Contact clusters were then used to fit a transmission model to sero-epidemiological data for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in each country.</p>
<p>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Across the five countries, 9-15 clusters were found to optimise both quality of clustering (measured using average silhouette width) and quality of fit (measured using several information criteria). Of these, 2-3 clusters were most relevant to VZV transmission, characterised by (i) 1-2 clusters of age-assortative contacts in schools, (ii) a cluster of less age-assortative contacts in non-school settings. Quality of fit was similar to using contacts stratified by a single characteristic, providing validation that single stratifications are appropriate. However, using clustering to stratify contacts using multiple characteristics provided insight into the structures underlying infection transmission, particularly the role of age-assortative contacts, involving school age children, for VZV transmission between households.

<p>All OECD countries have either legally mandated severance pay or compensations imposed by industry level bargaining in case of employer initiated job separations. The paper shows that mandatory severance is optimal in presence of wage deferrals induced by workers' moral hazard. We also establish a link between optimal severance and efficiency of the legal system and characterize the effects of shifting the burden of proof from the employer to the worker. Quantitatively, the welfare effects of suboptimal severance payments vary in general equilibrium between I and 3 %. The model accounts also for two neglected features of the legislation. The first is the discretion of judges in declaring the nature, economic vs. disciplinary, of the layoff. The second feature regards the relationship between severance and tenure. Our theory gives necessary conditions under which optimal severance is increasing with tenure, as generally observed. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.</p>"

Firstly, we focus on the estimation of the treatment effect of being located within the park. Our results show a significant difference between on and off park firms with respect to their innovativeness and propensity to invest in R & D; to the contrary, firms' growth appears unaffected by location effects. Secondly, we analyse what features of Science Parks drive the impact on the diverse measures of performance.

In systems with isolated neutral or with resonant earthing, this may be sufficient to provide safety from electric shock.

<p>We argue that the divergence in fertility trends in advanced societies is influenced by the interaction of long-standing differences in generalized trust with the increase in women's educational attainment. Our argument builds on the idea that trust enhances individuals' and couples' willingness to outsource childcare to outside their extended family. This becomes critically important as women's increased education leads to greater demand for combining work and family life. We test our hypothesis using data from the World Values Survey and European Values Study on 36 industrialized countries between the years 1981 and 2009. Multilevel statistical analyses reveal that the interaction between national-level generalized trust and cohort-level women's education is positively associated with completed fertility.

<p>This article reconsiders the relative growth performance of centrally planned economies in the broader context of postwar growth in Europe. It reports a new dataset of revised estimates for investment rates in eastern European countries between 1950 and 1989. Complemented with data on other growth determinants, this evidence is used to re-evaluate the socialist growth record in a conditional convergence framework with a panel of 24 European countries. After controlling for relative backwardness, investment rates, and improvements in human capital, the findings show that centrally planned economies underperformed due to their relative inefficiency only after the postwar golden age. In the 1950s and 1960s, eastern Europe was falling behind mainly due to relatively low levels of investment and weak reconstruction dynamics. Both are explained, in part, by the lack of labour-supply flexibility that, in turn, resulted from the comparatively much larger negative impact of the war on population growth in eastern Europe.</p>"

<p>Completely random measures (CRM) represent the key building block of a wide variety of popular stochastic models and play a pivotal role in modern Bayesian Nonparametrics. The popular Ferguson & Klass representation of CRMs as a random series with decreasing jumps can immediately be turned into an algorithm for sampling realizations of CRMs or more elaborate models involving transformed CRMs. However, concrete implementation requires to truncate the random series at some threshold resulting in an approximation error. The goal of this paper is to quantify the quality of the approximation by a moment-matching criterion, which consists in evaluating a measure of discrepancy between actual moments and moments based on the simulation output. Seen as a function of the truncation level, the methodology can be used to determine the truncation level needed to reach a certain level of precision. The resulting moment-matching Ferguson & Klass algorithm is then implemented and illustrated on several popular Bayesian nonparametric models.</p>"

The overarching goal is to use the knowledge gained to support adaptation and mitigation decisions that require regional or global perspectives within the context of facilitating transformations to enable sustainable development, despite inevitable climate shifts and disruptions. ISIMIP uses community-agreed sets of scenarios with standardized climate variables and socioeconomic projections as inputs for projecting future risks and associated uncertainties, within and across sectors. The results are consistent multi-model assessments of sectoral risks and opportunities that enable studies that integrate across sectors, providing support for implementation of the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>"

<p>Declining welfare systems increase the importance of self-determination in pension decisions. Thus, the stability of long-life consumption markedly relies on individual long-range planning attitude. Our paper investigates how behavioural traits affect this attitude and influence the probability of holding voluntary integrative pension schemes (VIPS). We find that psychophysiological heterogeneity plays a role in predicting demand for VIPS, together with saving/indebtedness style and conventional sociodemographic characteristics. Specifically, individuals who have a high degree of non-planning impulsiveness, and who are inclined to intense psychophysiological arousals, are less likely to demand VIPS. Our results imply that behavioural individualities might prompt individuals to postpone, or even neglect, decisions necessary to maintain stable lifestyles in the long range.</p>"

<p>Technological innovation in healthcare yields better health outcomes but also drives healthcare expenditure, and governments are struggling to maintain an appropriate balance between patient access to modern care and the economic sustainability of healthcare systems. Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and centralized procurement are increasingly used to govern the introduction and diffusion of new technologies in an effort to make access to innovation financially sustainable. However, little empirical evidence is available to determine how they affect the selection of new technologies and unit prices. This paper focuses on medical devices (MDs) and investigates the combined effect of various HTA governance models and procurement practices on the two steps of the MD purchasing process (i.e., selecting the product and setting the unit price). Our analyses are based on primary data collected through a national survey of Italian public hospitals. The Italian National Health Service is an ideal case study because it is highly decentralized and because regions have adopted different HTA governance models (i.e., regional, hospital-based, double-level or no HTA), often in combination with centralized regional procurement programs. Hence, the Italian case allows us to test the impact of different combinations of HTA models and procurement programs in the various regions. The results show that regional HTA increases the probability of purchasing the costliest devices, whereas hospital-based HTA functions more like a cost containment unit. Centralized regional procurement does not significantly affect MD selection and is associated with a reduction in the MD unit price: on average, hospitals located in regions with centralized procurement pay 10.1% less for the same product. Hospitals located in regions with active regional HTA programs pay higher prices for the same device (+23.2% for inexpensive products), whereas hospitals that have developed internal HTA programs pay 8.3% on average more for the same product.

<p>This paper studies the issue of constitutional design, and supermajorities in particular, from a behavioral economics perspective. The relevant parameters are voting power, risk aversion, and pessimism. Voters who feel powerful prefer lower thresholds, while risk averters and those who feel pessimistic about the majority prefer higher thresholds. We also analyze the effects of loss aversion and overconfidence. The former leads voters to prefer more protective voting rules, a manifestation of their bias towards the status quo. The latter leads them to prefer overly low (high) protection when they receive good (bad) news about how others will vote. Finally, we study constitutional agreements on the voting rule. Members of the constituent assembly are heterogeneous in the parameters above. Weak and minority members anticipate high expropriation risk in future decisions. This gives them consistent leverage to push for a protective constitution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This article proposes a Bayesian estimation framework for a typical multi-factor model with time-varying risk exposures to macroeconomic risk factors and corresponding premia to price U.S. publicly traded assets. The model assumes that risk exposures and idiosyncratic volatility follow a break-point latent process, allowing for changes at any point on time but not restricting them to change at all points. The empirical application to 40 years of U.S. data and 23 portfolios shows that the approach yields sensible results compared to previous two-step methods based on naive recursive estimation schemes, as well as a set of alternative model restrictions. A variance decomposition test shows that although most of the predictable variation comes from the market risk premium, a number of additional macroeconomic risks, including real output and inflation shocks, are significantly priced in the cross-section. A Bayes factor analysis massively favors the proposed change-point model. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.</p>"

We optimise the allocation of the observations within the performance clusters by applying an enhanced version of an observation re-allocation procedure proposed in our previous work. Next, based on the result of the grouping phase, we construct a performance class variable by attaching a performance label to each data row. Then, in the second phase of our methodology, we propose a feed-forward neural-network classification model that maps the input space to the newly-constructed performance class variable. This model allows us to forecast the performance of new companies as data become available.</p>"

<p>This study proposes a framework that aims to explain why successive changes in industry leadership (called also the catch-up cycle) occur over time in a sector. In catch-up cycles, latecomer firms and countries emerge as international leaders, whereas incumbents lose their previous positions. New leaders are then dethroned by newcomers. To identify factors at the base of catch-up cycles, this article adopts a sectoral system framework and identifies windows of opportunity that may emerge during the long run evolution of an industry. This study proposes three windows related to the specific dimensions of a sectoral system. One dimension is related to changes in knowledge and technology. The second dimension pertains to changes in demand, and the third includes changes in institutions and public policy. The combination of the opening of a window (technological, demand, or institutional/policy) and the responses of firms and other components of the sectoral system of the latecomer and incumbent countries determines changes in industrial leadership and catch-up. Sectors differ according to the type of windows that may open and the responses of firms and other components of systems. Empirical evidence of catch-up cycles is presented from six sectors, namely mobile phones, cameras, semiconductors, steel, mid-sized jets, and wines. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>The wine industry is an extremely interesting sector from a catch-up point of view because the latecomers in the international market have changed how wine is produced, sold and consumed and, in doing so, they have challenged the positions of incumbents. Until the end of the 1980s, the European countries, and particularly France and Italy, dominated the international market for wine. Subsequently, significant changes in the market, namely decreases in consumption by traditional consuming countries, the entry of new inexperienced consumers, and the increasing importance of large distribution have threatened this supremacy. Initially, the USA and Australia and later emerging countries such as Chile and South Africa, gained increasing market shares in both exported volumes and value, at the expense of incumbents. However, some of these newcomers (e.g. Australia) have shown slower growth, opening opportunities for newer entrants such as Argentina and New Zealand. At the same time, some of the incumbents (especially Italy) have innovated, challenging the leadership of France in key markets such as the USA. In this article we investigate the different catch-up cycles in the global wine sector that occurred between the 1960s and 2010, through a detailed analysis of export volumes, values and unit prices. We address issues related to the increasing share in the global market of latecomer countries and the relative decline of the incumbents, as well as possible changes in the market leadership within these two groups.

<p>Successive changes in industrial leadership between both firms and countries (described here as catch-up cycles) have been common in several sectors. This article develops a history-friendly model to explore the role played by technological conditions in the emergence of such leadership changes. The model is inspired by two cases where the emergence of disruptively novel technology played an important role: mobile phones and semiconductors. In the baseline setting the model is able to generate the benchmark case of three cycles with two leadership changes. In particular, the simulation analysis reveals that: (a) the more disruptive the new technology and the lower the incumbents' capabilities, the greater the shake-up of market shares between incumbents and latecomers; (b) leadership change is more likely to occur when it coincides with certain responses by the actors to the technological disruption, such as a high lock-in behaviour on the part of incumbents; and (c) a technology-driven change of industrial leadership is more likely to occur in the presence of increasing returns to technological investments. The counterfactual experiments show that different catch-up dynamics can emerge depending on the magnitude of technological disruption, the degree of lock-ins, the shape of technological landscape, and incumbents' initial capabilities. In particular, four other types of catch-up cycle are generated - the aborted cycle, persistent leadership, return of the old leadership, and coexistence in leadership between latecomers and incumbents. Each of these cycles is identified with a specific historical case of catch-up. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400-1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO(2) to more than 120 GtCO(2) per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6 W/m(2) that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2 degrees C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).

<p>Assessing medical devices (MDs) raises challenges which require us to reflect on whether current methods are adequate. Major features of devices are: (i) device-operator interaction can generate learning curve effects; (ii) incremental nature of innovation needs to be addressed by careful identification of the alternatives for comparative and incremental cost-effectiveness analysis; and (iii) broader organizational impact in terms of training and infrastructure, coupled with dynamic pricing, requires a more flexible approach to costing. The objective of the MedtecHTA project was to investigate improvements in HTA methods to allow for more comprehensive evaluation of MDs. It consisted of several work packages concerning (i) the available evidence on the currently adopted approaches for regulation and HTA of medical devices; (ii) the geographical variation in access to MDs; (iii) the development of methodological frameworks for conducting comparative effectiveness research and economic evaluation of MDs; and (iv) the organizational impact of MDs. This introductory paper summarizes the main results of the project and draws out the main overarching themes. This supplement represents a comprehensive report of all the main findings of the MedtecHTA project, and it is intended to be the main source for researchers and policy makers wanting information on the project.

<p>Much criticism has been directed at the licencing requirements for medical devices (MDs) as they often result in a lack of robust evidence to inform health technology assessment (HTA) decisions. To better understand the current international decisional framework on MD technologies, we undertook three linked research studies: a review of the device regulatory procedures, a survey of current HTA practices and an empirical comparison of HTA reports of drugs versus MDs. Our review confirms that current device regulatory processes across the globe are substantially less stringent than drugs. As a result, international HTA agencies report that they face a number of challenges when assessing MDs, including reliance on suboptimal data to make clinical and cost-effectiveness decisions. Whilst many HTA agencies have adapted their processes and procedures to handle MD technology submissions, in our comparison of HTA reports we found little evidence of the application of methodologies that take account of device-specific issues, such as incremental development. Overall, our research reinforces the need for better linkage between licencing and HTA and the development and application of innovative HTA methodologies with the objective of securing faster patient access for those technologies that can be shown to represent good value for money.

<p>Despite established efficacy for cardiac implantable electrical devices (CIEDs), large differences in CIED implant rates have been documented across and within countries. The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of socio-economic, epidemiological and supply side factors on CIED implant rates across 57 Regions in 5 EU countries and to assess the feasibility of using administrative data for this purpose. A total of 1330098 hospitalizations for CIED procedures extracted from hospital discharge databases in Austria, England, Germany, Italy and Slovenia from 2008 to 2012 was used in the analysis. Higher levels of tertiary education among the labour force and percent of aged population are positively associated with implant rates of CIED. Regional per capita GDP and number of implanting centres appear to have no significant effect. Institutional factors are shown to be important for the diffusion of CIED. Wide variation in CIED implant rates across and within five EU countries is undeniable. However, regional factors play a limited part in explaining these differences with few exceptions. Administrative databases are a valuable source of data for investigating the diffusion of medical technologies, while the choice of appropriate modelling strategy is crucial in identifying the drivers for variation across countries.

<p>Evaluation of clinical effectiveness of medical devices differs in some aspects from the evaluation of pharmaceuticals. One of the main challenges identified is lack of robust evidence and a will to make use of experimental and observational studies (OSs) in quantitative evidence synthesis accounting for internal and external biases. Using a case study of total hip replacement to compare the risk of revision of cemented and uncemented implant fixation modalities, we pooled treatment effect estimates from OS and RCTs, and simplified existing methods for bias-adjusted evidence synthesis to enhance practical application. We performed an elicitation exercise using methodological and clinical experts to determine the strength of beliefs about the magnitude of internal and external bias affecting estimates of treatment effect. We incorporated the bias-adjusted treatment effects into a generalized evidence synthesis, calculating both frequentist and Bayesian statistical models. We estimated relative risks as summary effect estimates with 95% confidence/credibility intervals to capture uncertainty. When we compared alternative approaches to synthesizing evidence, we found that the pooled effect size strongly depended on the inclusion of observational data as well as on the use bias-adjusted estimates. We demonstrated the feasibility of using observational studies in meta-analyses to complement RCTs and incorporate evidence from a wider spectrum of clinically relevant studies and healthcare settings. To ensure internal validity, OS data require sufficient correction for confounding and selection bias, either through study design and primary analysis, or by applying post-hoc bias adjustments to the results.

<p>Medical devices (MDs) have distinctive features, such as incremental innovation, dynamic pricing, the learning curve and organisational impact, that need to be considered when they are evaluated. This paper investigates how MDs have been assessed in practice, in order to identify methodological gaps that need to be addressed to improve the decision-making process for their adoption. We used the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist supplemented by some additional categories to assess the quality of reporting and consideration of the distinctive features of MDs. Two case studies were considered: transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) representing an emerging technology and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) representing a mature technology. Economic evaluation studies published as journal articles or within Health Technology Assessment reports were identified through a systematic literature review. A total of 19 studies on TAVI and 41 studies on ICDs were analysed. Learning curve was considered in only 16% of studies on TAVI. Incremental innovation was more frequently mentioned in the studies of ICDs, but its impact was considered in only 34% of the cases. Dynamic pricing was the most recognised feature but was empirically tested in less than half of studies of TAVI and only 32% of studies on ICDs. Finally, organisational impact was considered in only one study of ICDs and in almost all studies on TAVI, but none of them estimated its impact. By their very nature, most of the distinctive features of MDs cannot be fully assessed at market entry. However, their potential impact could be modelled, based on the experience with previous MDs, in order to make a preliminary recommendation. Then, well-designed post-market studies could help in reducing uncertainties and make policymakers more confident to achieve conclusive recommendations. (c) 2017 The Authors.

<p>Decisions about the adoption of medical interventions are informed by evidence on their costs and effects. For a range of reasons, evidence relating to medical devices may be limited. The decision to adopt a device early in its life cycle when the evidence base is least mature may impact on the prospects of acquiring further evidence to reduce uncertainties. Equally, rejecting a device will result in no uptake in practice and hence no chance to learn about performance. Decision options such as only in research' or approval with research' can overcome these issues by allowing patients early access to promising new technologies while limiting the risks associated with making incorrect decisions until more evidence or learning is established. In this paper, we set out the issues relating to uncertainty and the value of research specific to devices: learning curve effects, incremental device innovation, investment and irrecoverable costs, and dynamic pricing. We show the circumstances under which an only in research or approval with research scheme may be an appropriate policy choice. We also consider how the value of additional research might be shared between the manufacturer and health sector to help inform who might reasonably be expected to conduct the research needed.

<p>Decisions to adopt medical devices at the hospital level have consequences for health technology assessment (HTA) on system level and are therefore important to decision makers. Our aim was to investigate the characteristics of organizations and individuals that are more inclined to adopt and utilize cardiovascular devices based on a comprehensive analysis of environmental, organizational, individual, and technological factors and to identify corresponding implications for HTA. Seven random intercept hurdle models were estimated using the data obtained from 1249 surveys completed by members of the European Society of Cardiology. The major findings were that better manufacturer support increased the adoption probability of new' devices (i.e. in terms of CE mark approval dates), and that budget pressure increased the adoption probability of old' devices. Based on our findings, we suggest investigating the role of manufacturer support in more detail to identify diffusion patterns relevant to HTA on system level, to verify whether it functions as a substitute for medical evidence of new devices, and to receive new insights about its relationship with clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.

<p>There are particular characteristics of Medical Devices, such as the device-user interaction, the incremental nature of innovation and the broader organizational impact that lead to additional challenges for health technology assessment (HTA). The project explored key aspects of the conduct and methods of HTA for MDs. Systematic reviews and original research studies were conducted to determine improvements in processes and methods that could enhance the potential for HTA and optimize the diffusion of MDs. Regulatory processes for MDs should be more closely aligned, the HTA evaluative framework should be harmonized and processes for conditional coverage and evidence development should be used. The methods for HTA should consider MDs as complex interventions, require the establishment of high quality registries, consider an iterative approach to the evaluation over time, recognize and allow for the particular characteristics of devices and use appropriate approaches for confounder adjustment in comparative effectiveness studies. To optimize the diffusion, a common classification should be developed across countries in order to facilitate international comparisons, factors driving diffusion should be explored in HTA reports and physicians' personal goals and motivation should be better understood. The key recommendations of the MedtecHTA project should improve the conduct and use of HTA for MDs. (c) 2017 The Authors. Health Economics published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p>"

<p>International Standards define a Global Earthing System as an earthing net created interconnecting local Earthing Systems (generally through the shield of MV cables and/or bare buried conductors). In Italy, the regulatory authority for electricity and gas requires distributors to guarantee the electrical continuity of LV neutral conductor. This requirement has led to the standard practice of realizing ""reinforcement groundings"" along the LV neutral conductor path and at users' delivery cabinet. Moreover, in urban high-load scenarios (prime candidates to be part of a Global Earthing System), it is common that LV distribution scheme creates, through neutral conductors, an effective connection between grounding systems of MV/LV substations, modifying Global Earthing System consistency. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect, in terms of electrical safety, of the aforementioned LV neutral distribution scheme when an MV-side fault to ground occurs. For this purpose, simulations are carried out on a realistic urban test case and suitable evaluation indexes are proposed.</p>"

<p>Tourism is one of the prime manifestations of the 'great acceleration of humankind' since the Anthropocene started around 1950. The almost 50-fold increase in international tourism arrivals has substantial implications for environmental sustainability, but these have not yet been fully explored. This paper argues that a full exploration requires the study of tourism as a complex socio-ecological system. Such approach integrates environmental processes and stakeholder behaviour and puts feedbacks in the spotlight. Systemic insights can inform strategies to address tourism's problematic environmental performance. The paper finds that systems approaches in tourism research are rare and identifies a number of challenges: the large number of stakeholders involved; the heterogeneity of stakeholders; and the lack of transdisciplinarity in tourism research. The paper then argues that agent-based modelling can help address some of these challenges. Agent-based modelling allows to run simplified tourism systems with heterogeneous stakeholders and explore their behaviour, thus acting as living hypotheses. They do this by: ( 1) representing tourism's dynamics in a systemic, intuitive and individual-based way; ( 2) combining theories from different domains; ( 3) unpacking the link between stakeholder behaviours and emergent tourism system patterns; and ( 4) connecting researchers and stakeholders. Agent-based models allow representation of heterogeneous agents driven by plausible needs, who perceive local context and interact socially. Companion modelling is identified as a promising tool for more effective stakeholder inclusion.</p>"

<p>Background: Distinct RNA species may compete for binding to microRNAs (miRNAs). This competition creates an indirect interaction between miRNA targets, which behave as miRNA sponges and eventually influence each other's expression levels. Theoretical predictions suggest that not only the mean expression levels of targets but also the fluctuations around the means are coupled through miRNAs. This may result in striking effects on a broad range of cellular processes, such as cell differentiation and proliferation. Although several studies have reported the functional relevance of this mechanism of interaction, detailed experiments are lacking that study this phenomenon in controlled conditions by mimicking a physiological range.</p>
<p>Results: We used an experimental design based on two bidirectional plasmids and flow cytometry measurements of cotransfected mammalian cells. We validated a stochastic gene interaction model that describes how mRNAs can influence each other's fluctuations in a miRNA-dependent manner in single cells. We show that miRNA-target correlations eventually lead to either bimodal cell population distributions with high and low target expression states, or correlated fluctuations across targets when the pool of unbound targets and miRNAs are in near-equimolar concentration. We found that there is an optimal range of conditions for the onset of cross-regulation, which is compatible with 10-1000 copies of targets per cell.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Our results are summarized in a phase diagram for miRNA-mediated cross-regulation that links experimentally measured quantities and effective model parameters. This phase diagram can be applied to in vivo studies of RNAs that are in competition for miRNA binding.</p>"

We present a randomized experiment in which 700 Italian women of reproductive age with no children are exposed to positive information about formal child care through a text message or a video, while others are not. We find a positive effect on the intention to use formal child care and a negative effect on the intention to work. This average result hides important heterogeneities: the positive effect on formal child care use is driven by high-educated women, while the negative effect on work intention is found only among less-educated women. These findings may be explained by women's education reflecting their work-family orientation, and their ability to afford formal child care.</p>"

<p>Ethnography is defined as a research methodology based on sustained, explicit, methodical observation and paraphrasing of social situations in relation to their naturally occurring events. The value of producing local observational data over extended periods of time lies in the ability to systematically explore the subjective construction of meanings and its consequences on organizational and institutional dynamics. Based on a systematic review of published ethnographic studies in the field of public management, this article investigates how ethnography has been conceptualized and employed by the scholarly community in the past 25 years (1990-2014); it highlights the methodological features of the ethnographic design; and it outlines a set of research directions for future applications of the ethnographic approach to the study of theoretically and empirically relevant phenomena.

We compare a bundling first-price auction with two equivalent treatments where allotment is implemented: a two-unit discriminatory auction and two simultaneous single-unit first-price auctions. We find that allotment in the form of a discriminatory auction generates a loss of efficiency with respect to bundling. In the allotment treatments, we observe large and persistent bid spread, and the discriminatory auction is less efficient than simultaneous auctions. We provide a unified interpretation of our results that is based on both a non-equilibrium response to the coordination problem characterizing the simultaneous auction format and a general class of behavioral preferences that includes risk aversion, joy of winning and loser's regret as specific cases.</p>"

In particular, a single industry is divided into a number of market segments, each characterized by a different degree of horizontal product differentiation. Such a setup allows us to explain, within a single theoretical framework, the non-linear relations between firm productivity, size and exporting behavior that have been documented by the empirical literature. The theoretical results are tested empirically by examining the performance of French wine producers operating in market segments characterized by different levels of horizontal product differentiation. Such segments are identified using the official classification of French wines based upon the controlled denomination of origin, i.e., the Appellation d'Origine Controlee (AOC) system.</p>"

<p>Despite numerous attempts to agree on the nature of the relationship between environmental and financial performance, controversial results still exist in the literature. This discrepancy suggests that we must enlarge the spectrum of analysis to understand when it pays to be green. The way in which society takes a stance on environmental responsibility is deeply bounded to the cultural lenses through which it sets its priorities. A cultural perspective can help explain the capacity for social phenomena to shape behaviour. We consider how the contextual environment of culture, thus far neglected, might moderate the corporate environmental performance-corporate financial performance relationship and thus influence firms' capacity to offset the costs of environmental management. By using a sample of 954 companies, we contribute to the long-running debate, showing how the effect of cultural influence can overcome the hurdle of contrasting results and offer novel insights for both academia and practitioners.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

<p>Objectives This study presents a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing hydrophilic coated to uncoated catheters for patients performing urinary intermittent catheterisation. A national budget impact analysis is also included to evaluate the impact of intermittent catheterisation for management of bladder dysfunctions over a period of 5years.</p>
<p>Design A Markov model (lifetime horizon, 1year cycle length) was developed to project health outcomes (life years and quality-adjusted life years) and economic consequences related to patients using hydrophilic coated or uncoated catheters. The model was populated with catheter-related clinical efficacy data retrieved from randomised controlled trials and quality-of-life data (utility weights) from the literature. Cost data (EUR, 2015) were estimated on the basis of healthcare resource consumption derived from an e-survey addressed to key opinion leaders in the field.</p>
<p>Setting Italian Healthcare Service perspective.</p>
<p>Population Patients with spinal cord injury performing intermittent urinary catheterisation in the home setting.</p>
<p>Main outcome measures Incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios (ICER and ICUR) of hydrophilic coated versus uncoated catheters and associated healthcare budget impact.</p>
<p>Results The base-case ICER and ICUR associated with hydrophilic coated catheters were Euro20761 and Euro24405, respectively. This implies that hydrophilic coated catheters are likely to be cost-effective in comparison to uncoated ones, as proposed Italian threshold values range between Euro25000 and Euro66400. Considering a market share at year 5 of 89% hydrophilic catheters and 11% uncoated catheters, the additional cost for Italy is approximately Euro12 million in the next 5years (current market share scenario for year 0: 80% hydrophilic catheters and 20% uncoated catheters).</p>
<p>Conclusions Considered over a lifetime, hydrophilic coated catheters are potentially a cost-effective choice in comparison to uncoated ones. These findings can assist policymakers in evaluating intermittent catheterisation in patients with spinal cord injury.</p>"

By building on data pertaining to 9,692 inventors from 23 countries, this study shows that female inventors represent only 4.2% of total inventors, and they earn about 14% less than their male peers. The gap persists even when controlling for sources of heterogeneity, the selection of inventors into types of jobs and tasks, and potential parenthood, instrumented by exploiting a source of variation related to religious practices. The income gap is not associated with differences in the quality of the inventions that female and male inventors produce. Thus, even in this human capital-intensive profession, where capabilities and education are important assets, and productivity differentials can be observed, women earn less than men, though they contribute to the development of high-quality inventions as much as men do.</p>"

<p>Technology transfer is an important channel of technological change and sustainable development for countries with less innovative ability than technological leaders. This paper studies whether domestic environmental policies affect the inward technology transfer of cleaner innovation from abroad. We focus specifically on the power sector, for its important role in the decarbonization process, by looking at zero-carbon (renewable) and carbon-saving (efficient fossil) technologies for energy production. Using data on cross-country patent applications, we provide evidence that environmental policy contributes to attracting foreign cleaner technology options to OECD markets but not to non-OECD markets. We show that this is due to the nature of the implemented policy instruments. Market-based approaches positively impact technology transfer to both OECD and non-OECD economies, while non-market based approaches have at best only a weak effect in OECD countries. Domestic environmental policies may provide too weak a signal for foreign innovators in countries off the technological frontier. This calls for a strengthening of policy incentives for technology transfer in light of pressing climate change objectives.</p>"

<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to investigate the parallel decline of early baptism and early mortality at the beginning of the demographic transition in a European high-neonatal mortality context.</p>
<p>METHODS</p>
<p>We use an individual-nominative linked database of 33,000 births and 10,000 deaths for 11 parishes in the province of Padua (northeast Italy) from 1816 to 1870. We utilize life tables, logistic regressions, and two-level logistic regressions, including characteristics of the family.</p>
<p>RESULTS</p>
<p>Life tables and regression models show that during the winter, the association between early baptism and the risk of death is pronounced. The connection persists also during the summer, when the exposure to low temperature could not influence the risk of death, and a reverse effect could prevail. (Children in periculo mortis were immediately baptized.) Family behaviours influence both early baptism and early death.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
<p>The data shows clearly that those social groups and families and those areas experiencing the most intense decline in early baptism were also those in which mortality during the first three months of life declined more. However, it is not true that - as suggested by commentators at the time -the strong statistical connection between the two events was just a direct one, with cold exposure exacerbated by early baptism increasing the risk of dying from hypothermia or respiratory diseases.</p>
<p>CONTRIBUTION</p>
<p>We first show that in the province of Padua during the central part of the 19th century (1816-1870), there is a clear and strong statistical connection between the decline of early mortality and the decline of early baptism. Second, we try to disentangle the meaning of this connection.</p>"

<p>Scenarios showing future greenhouse gas emissions are needed to estimate climate impacts and the mitigation efforts required for climate stabilization. Recently, the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) have been introduced to describe alternative social, economic and technical narratives, spanning a wide range of plausible futures in terms of challenges to mitigation and adaptation1. Thus far the key drivers of the uncertainty in emissions projections have not been robustly disentangled. Here we assess the sensitivities of future CO2 emissions to key drivers characterizing the SSPs. We use six state-of-the-art integrated assessment models with different structural characteristics, and study the impact of five families of parameters, related to population, income, energy effciency, fossil fuel availability, andlow-carbon energy technology development. A recently developed sensitivity analysis algorithm2 allows us to parsimoniously compute both the direct and interaction effects of each of these drivers on cumulative emissions. The study reveals that the SSP assumptions about energy intensity and economic growth are the most important determinants of future CO2 emissions from energy combustion, both with and without a climate policy. Interaction terms between parameters are shown to be important determinants of the total sensitivities.</p>"

We randomized the way information was provided across participants using three different formats similar to those used in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports(2,3). In spite of having received all available relevant scientific information, policymakers adopted such information very conservatively, assigning it less weight than their own prior beliefs. However, providing individual model estimates in addition to the statistical range was more effective in mitigating such inertia. The experiment was repeated with a population of European MBA students who, despite starting from similar priors, reported conditional probabilities closer to the provided models' forecasts than policymakers. There was also no effect of presentation format in the MBA sample. These results highlight the importance of testing visualization tools directly on the population of interest.</p>"

<p>Objectives: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the use of transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with that of sorafenib in the treatment of patients with intermediate or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system. Methods: Patient-level data were consecutively recorded and collected at three oncology centers in Italy. A propensity score matching was performed to compare patients with similar clinical characteristics who underwent TARE or sorafenib treatment. Clinical data from the matched cohorts were used to populate a Markov model to project, on a lifetime horizon, life years, quality adjusted life years, and economic outcomes associated with TARE and sorafenib for both intermediate and advanced HCC stages. Results: Starting from data covering 389 and 241 patients who underwent TARE and sorafenib treatment, respectively, the propensity score matching yielded a total of 308 matched patients. For intermediate-stage patients, the model estimated for TARE versus sorafenib an incremental cost-utility ratio of (sic)3,302/QALY (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of (sic)1,865 per life year gained), whereas for patients in advanced stage TARE dominated (lower costs and greater health improvements) compared with sorafenib. Conclusions: From an Italian health care service perspective, TARE could be a cost-effective strategy in comparison with sorafenib for patients with intermediate or advanced HCC. The results from forthcoming randomized controlled trials comparing TARE with sorafenib will be able to confirm or reject the validity of this preliminary evaluation. In the meantime, decision makers can use these results to control and coordinate the diffusion of the technology.</p>"

<p>The efficacy of medicines, medical devices, and other health technologies should be proved in trials that assess final patient-relevant outcomes such as survival or morbidity. Market access and coverage decisions are, however, often based on surrogate end points, biomarkers, or intermediate end points, which aim to substitute and predict patient-relevant outcomes that are unavailable because of methodological, financial, or practical constraints. We provide a summary of the present use of surrogate end points in health care policy, discussing the case for and against their adoption and reviewing validation methods. We introduce a three-step framework for policymakers to handle surrogates, which involves establishing the level of evidence, assessing the strength of the association, and quantifying relations between surrogates and final outcomes. Although the use of surrogates can be problematic, they can, when selected and validated appropriately, offer important opportunities for more efficient clinical trials and faster access to new health technologies that benefit patients and health care systems.</p>"

<p>Evidence suggests that the increasing life expectancy levels at birth witnessed over the past centuries are associated with a decreasing concentration of the survival times. The purpose of this work is to study the relationships that exist between longevity and concentration measures for some regression models for the evolution of survival. In particular, we study a family of survival models that can be used to capture the observed trends in longevity and concentration over time. The parametric family of log-scale-location models is shown to allow for modeling different trends of expected value and concentration of survival times. An extension towards mixture models is also described in order to take into account scenarios where a fraction of the population experiences short term survival. Some results are also presented for such framework. The use of both the log-scale-location family and the mixture model is illustrated through an application to period life tables from the Human Mortality Database.</p>"

<p>The article contests the claim that EU private law is narrowly circumscribed by a market rationality. Such a claim tracks broader criticism of EU functional legal integration, although it tends to obscure the underlying transformative pressures on private law and regulation and the role EU law plays in coping with such pressures. To offer a number of counter-narratives, the article draws on examples from the regulated sectors, including telecommunications and energy, to reveal their experimentalist features. These suggest that EU private law is constructed through a process of error-corrections, which allows for mutual adjustment of instruments and hybridisation of EU and local policy goals. The process results in more finely grained assemblages of autonomy and regulation to respond to concrete problems or newly salient policy goals, so that markets are understood as social institutions that are always works-in-progress rather than convergence points. Thus, EU private law provides a platform for transnational market-building through innovating institutions that promote various normative and policy commitments despite the interdependencies that could undermine them.</p>"

<p>In a decision problem under uncertainty, a decision maker considers a set of alternative actions whose consequences depend on uncertain factors beyond his control. Following Luce and Raiffa (Games and decisions: introduction and critical survey. Wiley, New York, 1957), we adopt a natural representation of such a situation which takes as primitives a set of conceivable actions A, a set of states S and a consequence function rho: A x S -> C. Each action induces a map from states to consequences, a Savage act, and each mixed action induces a map from states to probability distributions over consequences, an Anscombe-Aumann act. Under an axiom of consequentialism, preferences over pure or mixed actions yield corresponding preferences over the induced acts. This observation allows us to relate the Luce-Raiffa description of a decision problem to the most common framework of modern decision theory which directly takes as primitive a preference relation over the set of all Anscombe-Aumann acts. The key advantage of the latter framework is the possibility of applying powerful convex analysis techniques as in the seminal work of Schmeidler (Econometrica 57: 571-587, 1989) and the vast literature that followed. This paper shows that we can maintain the mathematical convenience of the Anscombe-Aumann framework within a description of decision problems which is closer to many applications and experiments. We argue that our framework ismore expressive as it allows us to be both explicit and parsimonious about the assumed richness of the set of conceivable actions, and to directly capture preference for randomization as an expression of uncertainty aversion.</p>"

<p>This article focuses on the dynamic relationship between the occupancy of a high-status position and the development of organizational capabilities. If, on the one hand, the cumulative advantage inherent in a high-status position gives rise to greater competitive strength, on the other hand, some scholars have emphasized how occupancy of a well-defined market position, such as a high-status one, weakens competitive intensity by reducing the motivation to compete aggressively. By integrating both perspectives, this article proposes a dynamic account of the relationship between occupancy of a high-status position and development of capabilities. Despite being more complacent with exchange partners, occupants of a high-status position extend such position by entering in new exchange relationships with partners providing resources of higher quality. Yet, occupancy of a high-status position undercuts the development of capabilities within the boundaries of the firm, leaving the firm less able to use and integrate the resources provided by existing exchange relationships.

The longitudinal structure of our experimental design allows us to assess the effects of the questionnaire manipulation both between and within subject. In our sample of university students, asking subjects to report satisfaction with life domains before reporting overall satisfaction with life generates a robust unpacking effect, as it shifts upwards the subsequent mean overall life satisfaction evaluations. In addition, raising awareness about life domains significantly increases reliability and validity of self-reported life satisfaction, by reducing the dispersion of responses and increasing the association between life satisfaction and life domain evaluations. We also detect heterogeneous effects across subgroups of our sample-such as people with children or in bad health- and discuss implications of these findings for research on life satisfaction.</p>"

<p>This paper investigates third party access regulatory issues in China's natural gas industry. We study the development of China's gas market-oriented reform and how third party access becomes a pressing issue in that context. This paper aims to report stakeholders' benefit and distributional effects during a hypothetical third party access process. To that end, we apply an oligopolistic equilibrium model, based on the mixed complementarity problem, to China's gas pipeline network. We compare two scenarios: a scenario without third party access and the other scenario where an independent pipeline operator optimizes flows. This latter scenario aims to guarantee that the maximum social benefit is achieved. In addition, the latter scenario transfers the congestion rent to former integrated gas companies to compensate their actual loss control of the pipeline operation, in order to minimize the adverse distributional effects for pipeline companies. The solution of the model indicates that operational separation is feasible with Pareto improvement in China's context. Moreover, it merits particular attention from policy makers in China that pipeline capacity scarcity should be properly evaluated and managed.</p>"

Of particular interest are special cases of our results obtained under the specification of the two parameter Poisson Dirichlet prior and the normalized generalized Gamma prior.

<p>Rare diseases are an important public health issue with high unmet need. The introduction of the EU Regulation on orphan medicinal products (OMP) has been successful in stimulating investment in the research and development of OMPs. Despite this advancement, patients do not have universal access to these new medicines. There are many factors that affect OMP uptake, but one of the most important is the difficulty of making pricing and reimbursement (P& R) decisions in rare diseases. Until now, there has been little consensus on the most appropriate assessment criteria, perspective or appraisal process. This paper proposes nine principles to help improve the consistency of OMP P& R assessment in Europe and ensure that value assessment, pricing and funding processes reflect the specificities of rare diseases and contribute to both the sustainability of healthcare systems and the sustainability of innovation in this field. These recommendations are the output of the European Working Group for Value Assessment and Funding Processes in Rare Diseases (ORPH-VAL), a collaboration between rare disease experts, patient representatives, academics, health technology assessment (HTA) practitioners, politicians and industry representatives. ORPH-VAL reached its recommendations through careful consideration of existing OMP P& R literature and through a wide consultation with expert stakeholders, including payers, regulators and patients. The principles cover four areas: OMP decision criteria, OMP decision process, OMP sustainable funding systems and European co-ordination. This paper also presents a guide to the core elements of value relevant to OMPs that should be consistently considered in all OMP appraisals. The principles outlined in this paper may be helpful in drawing together an emerging consensus on this topic and identifying areas where consistency in payer approach could be achievable and beneficial. All stakeholders have an obligation to work together to ensure that the promise of OMP's is realised.</p>"

<p>Despite their business relevance, creative professional service firms are under-researched, in particular with regard to how they compete for work. Competing for work is key to survival, but also extremely challenging due to the complexity of the services offered. In this paper we use a paradox framework to investigate the opposing demands that creative professional service firms experience when competing for work. Based on a set of semi-structured interviews in the context of architectural competitions, we show that creative professional service firms face two interwoven paradoxes which relate to the strategic intent (why to compete) and the design intent (what to propose) of client propositions. We describe these paradoxes and explain how organizations manage and cope with them through both synthesis and separation management approaches. Contributions of this study can be found in theorizing paradoxes of competing for work from the professional service provider's perspective, and in fostering the firms' paradoxical mind-set, which facilitates the acceptance and resolution of complexity and different competing demands.

<p>Our motivating application stems from surveys of natural populations and is characterized by large spatial heterogeneity in the counts, which makes parametric approaches to modeling local animal abundance too restrictive. We adopt a Bayesian nonparametric approach based on mixture models and innovate with respect to popular Dirichlet process mixture of Poisson kernels by increasing the model flexibility at the level both of the kernel and the nonparametric mixing measure. This allows to derive accurate and robust estimates of the distribution of local animal abundance and of the corresponding clusters. The application and a simulation study for different scenarios yield also some general methodological implications. Adding flexibility solely at the level of the mixing measure does not improve inferences, since its impact is severely limited by the rigidity of the Poisson kernel with considerable consequences in terms of bias. However, once a kernel more flexible than the Poisson is chosen, inferences can be robustified by choosing a prior more general than the Dirichlet process. Therefore, to improve the performance of Bayesian nonparametric mixtures for count data one has to enrich the model simultaneously at both levels, the kernel and the mixing measure.</p>"

<p>Predictive constructions are a powerful way of characterizing the probability laws of stochastic processes with certain forms of invariance, such as exchangeability or Markov exchangeability. When de Finetti-like representation theorems are available, the predictive characterization implicitly defines the prior distribution, starting from assumptions on the observables; moreover, it often helps in designing efficient computational strategies. In this paper we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the sequence of predictive distributions such that they characterize a Markov exchangeable probability law for a discrete valued process X. Under recurrence, Markov exchangeable processes are mixtures of Markov chains. Our predictive conditions are in some sense minimal sufficient conditions for Markov exchangeability; we also provide predictive conditions for recurrence. We illustrate their application in relevant examples from the literature and in novel constructions.</p>"

<p>Using data at the bank-firm level collected through the 9th UniCredit Survey conducted in 2012 on a large sample of small businesses, we investigate the extent to which a large international bank offers better credit conditions to enterprises that use ICT more extensively. The results, which are robust to selection and endogeneity issues, show that banks tend to grant increasing volumes of credit to such enterprises. We interpret this evidence as the ceteris paribus effect of ICT adoption by small businesses on the quality of information transmitted to banks. Another possible interpretation is that banks consider ICT adoption as a signal of firms' willingness to innovate. We also discuss implications concerning the key role that technology plays in changing the 'arm's length' versus 'relationship' lending paradigms.</p>"

<p>To progress beyond the idea that the value of interfirm collaboration is largely determined by the complementarity of the resources held by partners, we build a theoretical framework that explains under which conditions a set of resources or capabilities can be considered as complementary and resulting in superior value creation. Specifically, we argue that the tasks that an interfirm collaboration has to perform determine complementarities and that complementarities arise from similar and dissimilar resources alike. We capture this relationship in the concept of task resource complementarity. Further, we examine factors that impact on the relevance of this construct as a predictor of partner selection. Finally, we discuss which implications arise for a theory of the firm when tasks are explicitly incorporated into the conceptualization of resource complementarity.</p>"

<p>Across Europe grandparents play very different roles. This paper studies to what extent grandparents' role as providers of child care relates to the country policy context, focusing on public child-care services and parental leave regulation, and to the availability of part-time jobs for women. We also explore whether mothers' needs to combine family and work differently influence the frequency of grandparental child care across countries. The analysis combines micro-data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe and macro-indicators from the Multilinks database and Eurostat. We find a clear association between policy context and frequency of grandparental child care. Three models emerge. In countries close to the familialism by default model (i.e. characterised by scarce public child-care services and parental leave), when grandparents provide child care they often do it daily. In countries characterised by defamilialisation and supported familialism policies (with generous public services and parental leave) grandparents take on a marginal role. An intermediate model emerges in countries characterised by a limited offer of child care or parental leave, where grandparental child care complements state support and tends to be offered on a weekly basis. Our analysis corroborates the idea that the highly intensive involvement of grandparents in countries with low availability of part-time jobs for women is influenced by the need (unmet by the welfare) of mothers to combine work and family.</p>"

<p>Having a large network of colleagues means having several opportunities to help those colleagues, as well as a higher chance of receiving requests for help from them. Employees with large networks are therefore expected to help more in the workplace than those with small networks. However, large networks are also associated with cognitive costs, which may reduce the focal employee's ability to both recognize the need for help and engage in helping behaviours. For these reasons, the authors assert an inverted U-shaped relation between the size of an ego's social network and engagement in helping behaviour. However, high-quality relationships imply higher mutual understanding between the actors, and hence lower cognitive costs. In turn, the position (and threshold) of the curve between network size and interpersonal helping should be influenced by the quality of the relationship between the provider and the beneficiaries of help. Analysis of employee-level, single-firm data supports these ideas, providing preliminary evidence that quality of relationship compensates for the difficulties that may arise from having large social networks.</p>"

<p>The prediction of future outcomes of a random phenomenon is typically based on a certain number of ""analogous"" observations from the past. When observations are generated by multiple samples, a natural notion of analogy is partial exchangeability and the problem of prediction can be effectively addressed in a Bayesian nonparametric setting. Instead of confining ourselves to the prediction of a single future experimental outcome, as in most treatments of the subject, we aim at predicting features of an unobserved additional sample of any size. We first provide a structural property of prediction rules induced by partially exchangeable arrays, without assuming any specific nonparametric prior. Then we focus on a general class of hierarchical random probability measures and devise a simulation algorithm to forecast the outcome of m future observations, for any m >= 1. The theoretical result and the algorithm are illustrated by means of a real dataset, which also highlights the ""borrowing strength"" behavior across samples induced by the hierarchical specification.

<p>We investigated a novel avenue for buffering against threats to meaning frameworks: vintage consumption. Although the appeal of vintage goods, defined as previously owned items from an earlier era, is strong and growing, this paper is among the first to examine the possible psychological ramifications of vintage consumption. Six studies found that vintage items mitigated the typical reactions to meaning threats. Four of these studies also showed that vintage consumption facilitates mental connections among the past, present, and future. As a result, people whose meaning structures had been threatened, for example, by being reminded of their own eventual death, preferred vintage products more than others who had not experienced a meaning threat, and more than similar non-vintage products. These findings suggest that meaning disruptions stimulate a desire for intertemporal connections, a desire that vintage products as existing and continuing symbols of bygone eras seem to satisfy.

<p>Stochastic processes play an important role in the infectious disease dynamics of wildlife, especially in species subject to large population oscillations. Here, we study the case of a free ranging population of yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) in northern Italy, where circulation of Dobrava-Belgrade hantavirus (DOBV) has been detected intermittently since 2001, until an outbreak emerged in 2010. We analysed the transmission dynamics of the recent outbreak using a computational model that accounts for seasonal changes of the host population and territorial behaviour. Model parameters were informed by capture-mark-recapture data collected over 14years and longitudinal seroprevalence data from 2010 to 2013. The intermittent observation of DOBV before 2010 can be interpreted as repeated stochastic fadeouts after multiple introductions of infectious rodents migrating from neighbouring areas. We estimated that only 20% of introductions in a naive host population results in sustained transmission after 2years, despite an effective reproduction number well above the epidemic threshold (mean 4<bold></bold>5, 95% credible intervals, CI: 0<bold></bold>65-15<bold></bold>8). Following the 2010 outbreak, DOBV has become endemic in the study area, but we predict a constant probability of about 4<bold></bold>7% per year that infection dies out, following large population drops in winter. In the absence of stochastic fadeout, viral prevalence is predicted to continue its growth to an oscillating equilibrium around a value of 24% (95% CI: 3-57). We presented an example of invasion dynamics of a zoonotic virus where stochastic fadeout have played a major role and may induce future extinction of the endemic infection.</p>"

While prior research has considered the characteristics of the individuals generating project ideas, we shift the focus to the panel of selectors and explore how they shape the evaluation of novelty. We theorize that a high panel workload reduces panel preference for novelty in selection, whereas a diversity of panel expertise and a shared location between panel and applicant increase preference for novelty.

In the cross-section, the information content of the plan disclosures and the accuracy increase are incrementally associated with the extent of forward-looking narrative disclosures in the plan, after controlling for other disclosures within and outside the plan presentation and the fact that the firm has self-selected into the sample. Both quantitative and qualitative narrative disclosures are informative to investors and analysts. The results are driven by narrative disclosures about company strategy and action plans rather than about the business environment in which the company operates. Our study informs the current debate on the use of voluntary comprehensive, integrated, long-run-oriented strategic plan disclosure as a potential complement for disclosures such as quarterly earnings forecasts that have been described as an example of short-termism'.</p>"

<p>In this paper, we critically review literature on trade shows developed in industrial marketing (IM) and economic geography (EG), aiming to contribute to the ongoing conversation between these disciplines and showing that they can learn from each other. In IM, trade shows are conceived as promotional instruments, whereas in EG these events are seen as temporary clusters through which firms can escape the liabilities of embeddedness and interact with, and learn from, distant actors. EG literature has integrated insights from IM that have provided a means to go beyond earlier formulations that downplayed market-based learning processes at these events. IM has in fact far under-theorized space and conceived exhibitors as individual agents, neglecting the fact that many of these events are collective marketing platforms that industry agglomerations or geographical clusters can use to affirm their presence in international markets. Based on our analysis, we propose research directions that can benefit individual exhibitors as well as geographically-based business networks. The analysis addresses the boundaries and limitations of disciplinary analyses and strongly suggests transdisciplinary encounters and engagements in IM and EG research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

<p>This paper provides an empirical investigation of the role played by selected characteristics of the policy mix in inducing innovation in energy efficiency technologies. An original dataset covering 23 OECD countries over the period 1990-2010 combines the full set of policies in the energy efficiency domain for the residential sector with data on patents applied over the same period in this specific technological sector. The econometric results suggest that when the policy mix is characterised by a more balanced use in demand-pull and technology-push instruments, its positive effects on eco-innovation tend to be greater. Moreover, a more comprehensive policy mix is shown to be able to enhance innovation activities for the generation of new energy efficient technologies. However, the simple addition of an indiscriminate number of simultaneous policy instruments may reduce policy mix effectiveness. Finally, the empirical findings confirm previous evidence on the importance of policy spillover effects, and suggest that policy similarity between countries may represent an important aspect to be accounted for in policy mix design.

<p>Research policy observers are increasingly concerned about the potential impact of current academic working conditions on mental health, particularly in PhD students. The aim of the current study is threefold. First, we assess the prevalence of mental health problems in a representative sample of PhD students in Flanders, Belgium (N=3659). Second, we compare PhD students to three other samples: (1) highly educated in the general population (N=769); (2) highly educated employees (N=592); and (3) higher education students (N=333). Third, we assess those organizational factors relating to the role of PhD students that predict mental health status. Results based on 12 mental health symptoms (GHQ-12) showed that 32% of PhD students are at risk of having or developing a common psychiatric disorder, especially depression. This estimate was significantly higher than those obtained in the comparison groups. Organizational policies were significantly associated with the prevalence of mental health problems. Especially work family interface, job demands and job control, the supervisor's leadership style, team decision-making culture, and perception of a career outside academia are linked to mental health problems.

<p>The ability of an organization to apply knowledge globally has been conceptualized as critical for the existence of multinational corporations (MNCs). We argue for an organizational separation effect on knowledge sharing that challenges the view of the MNC as a latent social community. Using a unique data-set of more than 4000 individual responses from an MNC, Telenor, we test how three types of drivers for individuals' knowledge sharing-individuals' motivation, and individuals' perceptions of organizational values and organizational work practices-work differently within, as opposed to across, business units. Our analysis suggests that while intrinsic motivation, innovative values and job autonomy are relatively important drivers of knowledge sharing within the business units, extrinsic motivation, result-oriented values and participation in corporate employee development are relatively more important for knowledge sharing across business units.

<p>We study a parsimonious competition setting whereby two studio producers launch their movies simultaneously. They compete deciding about the positioning of their movies, as they can position close to or far from the mainstream, and investing in advertising and in quality. We study our competitive setting with an analytical model and solve it using a standard game-theoretical technique. Next, we use an agent-based model (ABM) to relax several assumptions of the analytical model and investigate more realistic market situations, such as symmetric as well as asymmetric positioning, competitions among big and/or small studios, settings with more than two competitors, and studios that use weighted and evolving decision rules. Our results explain interesting dynamics behind the scenes of the competition. They indicate the drivers of studios' behaviors and shed light on some important aspects of their strategic competition. In this sense, our results offer relevant theoretical and practical implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>AIMSIntravesical instillation of hyaluronic acid (HA) plus chondroitin sulfate (CS) in women with bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC) has shown promising results. This study compared the efficacy, safety, and costs of intravesical HA/CS (Ialuril((R)), IBSA) to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).</p>
<p>METHODSRandomized, open-label, multicenter study involving 110 women with BPS/IC. The allocation ratio (HA/CS:DMSO) was 2:1. Thirteen weekly instillations of HA (1.6%)/CS (2.0%) or 50% DMSO were given. Patients were evaluated at 3 (end-of-treatment) and 6 months. Primary endpoint was reduction in pain intensity at 6 months by visual analogue scale (VAS) versus baseline. Secondary efficacy measurements were quality of life and economic analyses.</p>
<p>RESULTSA significant reduction in pain intensity was observed at 6 months in both treatment groups versus baseline (P<0.0001) in the intention-to-treat population. Treatment with HA/CS resulted in a greater reduction in pain intensity at 6 months compared with DMSO for the per-protocol population (mean VAS reduction 44.7725.07 vs. 28.89 +/- 31.14, respectively; P=0.0186). There were no significant differences between treatment groups in secondary outcomes. At least one adverse event was reported in 14.86% and 30.56% of patients in the HA/CS and DMSO groups, respectively. There were significantly fewer treatment-related adverse events for HA/CS versus DMSO (1.35% vs. 22.22%; P=0.001).

<p>We analyze partial privatization by local governments, driven by investment and credit constraints, and provide a theory of monopolistic mixed firms based on strategic interaction between local politicians and private shareholders. Minority participation by private investors-as empirically observed-arises endogenously in the model to prevent investment expropriation. We consider the example of water supply with perfectly inelastic demand and fixed-price regulation, coupled with price discretion at a local level. Welfare-maximizing local governments face a trade-off between the increase in consumers' surplus and the reduction in costly public funds. Therefore, private shareholders choose investment to keep the government share at a threshold such that the politician always sticks to the price-cap and dividends are then maximized. To consider normative issues, we compare investment by mixed firms and by a social planner.</p>"

<p>We study the patterns of political selection in majoritarian versus proportional systems. Political parties face a trade off in choosing the mix of high- and low-quality candidates: high-quality candidates are valuable to voters, and thus help to win elections, but they crowd out loyal candidates, who are most preferred by the parties. Under proportional representation, politicians' selection depends on the share of swing voters in the entire electorate. In majoritarian elections, it depends also on the distribution of competitive versus safe (single-member) districts. We show that a majoritarian system with only a few competitive districts is less capable of selecting good politicians than a proportional system. As the share of competitive districts increases, the majoritarian system becomes more efficient than the proportional system. However, for a large enough share of competitive districts, a non-monotonic relation arises: the marginal (positive) effect of adding high-quality politicians on the probability of winning the election is reduced, and highly competitive majoritarian systems become less efficient than proportional ones in selecting good politicians.</p>"

<p>We analyse the role of financial barriers in affecting the adoption of environmental innovations (EI) with a focus on manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe. In taking stock of the consolidated literature on EI, we find that the role of financial barriers is substantially neglected, although crucial, even more relevant in the current phase of the economic cycle. Our empirical analysis confirms the existence of direct negative effects of financial barriers on environmental innovation investment decisions. It furthermore sheds more light on the determinants of financial barriers that shape firms' cleaner production choices. Our findings have the following policy implications: properly designed policies can play a critical role, not only by stimulating EI through their determinants, but also by acting on the financial obstacles to eco-innovation.Policy relevanceEnvironmental innovations (EI) are essential to achieve economic growth and environmental protection goals. Technological development is one of the key factors that can counterbalance the growth and population emission-augmenting effects. EI are a priority in major EU policy strategies and a prerequisite for the development of a Resource efficient Europe', one of the flagship initiatives of Europe 2020. The existence of financial barriers can constitute a serious deterrent for the eco-innovative capacity of firms, even more than for traditional' innovations, as EI are characterized by high technical risk, long payback period and uncertainty on the appropriability of private rents. This article analyses in depth whether barriers related to external financing affect EI investments and whether the stringency of financial constraints to investments in EI is affected by factors related to EI specificities. We show that when both direct and indirect effects on EI investments are considered, the role of the policy framework appears to be as particularly crucial in order to reverse the risk/return trade-off of eco-innovative investments. Targeting policy interventions to facilitate access to credit and to mitigate capital markets' imperfections is essential to mitigate the apparent contradiction between EU industrial policies and climate abatement scenarios.</p>"

<p>Is opening up the innovation process a ""must"", or rather an opportunity? This paper discusses whether closed innovation models are still suitable in the era of increasing technological networking, or is some degree of openness actually imposed. Starting from the premises given in the enormous amount of literature on open innovation, this paper investigates a case in the food industry, namely the Italian R&D subsidiary of the famous chocolate company, Lindt & Sprungli. The case concerns a company that states that it uses a closed approach to innovation. The paper shows what being closed actually means in Lindt. It also investigates why Lindt rejects an open model to innovation, and illustrates the actual characteristics of a ""closed"" approach in the open innovation era. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

<p>Innovation has traditionally been seen as the province of producers. However, theoretical and empirical research now shows that individual users-consumers-are also a major and increasingly important source of new product and service designs. In this paper, we build a microeconomic model of a market that incorporates demand-side innovation and competition. We explain the conditions under which firms find it beneficial to invest in supporting and harvesting users' innovations, and we show that social welfare rises when firms utilize this source of innovation. Our modeling also indicates reasons for policy interventions with respect to a mixed user and producer innovation economy. From the social welfare perspective, as the share of innovating users in a market increases, profit-maximizing firms tend to switch ""too late"" from a focus on internal research and development to a strategy of also supporting and harvesting user innovations. Underlying this inefficiency are externalities that the producer cannot capture. Overall, our results explain when and how the proliferation of innovating users leads to a superior division of innovative labor involving complementary investments by users and producers, both benefitting producers and increasing social welfare.</p>"

<p>Investor attention matters for corporate actions. Our new identification approach constructs firm-level shareholder ""distraction"" measures, by exploiting exogenous shocks to unrelated parts of institutional shareholders' portfolios. Firms with ""distracted"" shareholders are more likely to announce diversifying, value-destroying, acquisitions. They are also more likely to grant opportunistically timed CEO stock options, more likely to cut dividends, and less likely to fire their CEO for bad performance. Firms with distracted shareholders have abnormally low stock returns. Combined, these patterns are consistent with a model in which the unrelated shock shifts investor attention, leading to a temporary loosening of monitoring constraints.</p>"

We argue that managerial and stakeholder interventions shape the self-construction of team identity as well as the team's commitment to specific work objectives. We also suggest that team identity becomes isomorphic to organizational identity because of pressures related to: (1) the presence of a dense network of managers and stakeholders, which orients teams towards a focus on certain aspects of the higher-order identity; (2) the use of team routines and regular feedback loops, which force alignment with the organizational identity; and (3) the use of coordinating roles aimed at promoting, ratifying and reinforcing the convergence of identity within the team.

Based on our structural analysis, we find that oil-specific demand shocks have had positive effects on the US stock market since 2009 as opposed to oil supply shocks, which have no large effects on stock returns.

<p>International alliances have been studied in considerable depth, but almost entirely as host market entry options. And while much global value production is done through international alliances, the organizational forms used to control dispersed value chains are often reduced to ""make or buy""-that is, captive operations vs. market-based outsourcing. We examine how strategic purpose (vertical or offshore production vs. horizontal or production for local market entry) affects the choice of cooperative governance form. We contend that an offshore production role, as opposed to a market entry strategy, makes an alliance more likely to be governed as a contractual alliance than as a joint venture. Data on 261 cross-border alliances in the major appliances industry largely support our hypotheses. Further, strategic purpose moderates the effects of alliance activities and of the institutional environment of the host country on the choice of governance form. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, we employ the differences among estimates and impulse response functions across linear and nonlinear models to identify and measure cross-asset contagion. An application to weekly Eurozone data for a 2007-2014 sample reveals that a two-state Markov switching model shows economically weak, though accurately estimated, contagion effects in a crisis regime. These findings are mainly explained by a flight-to-quality channel. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to explore whether European markets may or may not have been subject to contagion when exposed to external shocks, such as those originated from the US subprime crisis.

The results confirm the pervasive nature of energy efficiency to be nested in many technological components. In addition, we show that a dematerialisation process has affected the evolution of energy efficiency technologies over time, in a technology space characterised by a high level of complexity and variety. Energy efficiency has links with information technologies embodied in the appliances, which are far from their maturity path. Consequently, innovation and information policies are of utmost importance in order to achieve more ambitious energy efficiency targets in the groups of appliances analysed.</p>"

<p>Impact of European Cohesion Policy on regional growth: does local economic structure matter? Regional Studies. A growing body of literature has analysed the effect of European Cohesion Policy on regional gross domestic product (GDP) growth. The paper contributes to this literature by discussing Structural Funds and assigning an explicit role to the choice of strategy and the economic structure of regions. In particular, adopting a regression discontinuity design with heterogeneous treatment and using data on NUTS-3 regions makes it possible to identify the causal impact of Structural Funds on regional growth according to the size of the service sector, a sector that accounts for a large share of total Structural Funds expenditure. The paper shows that the larger the sector, the greater the amount of financial resources directed to services and the slower is growth. The interpretation pertaining to policy implications is that higher growth rates can be obtained by promoting the service sector at its early stages, i.e., when it is comparatively small and its potential for productivity growth is higher.</p>"

<p>How does political unrest influence public policy? We assume that protests are an emotional reaction to unfair treatment. Individuals have a consistent view of fairness that internalizes government constraints. Individuals accept lower welfare if the government is more constrained. This resignation effect induces a benevolent government to delay unpleasant choices and accumulate public debt to mitigate social unrest. More radical and homogeneous groups are more prone to unrest and hence more influential. Even if the government is benevolent and all groups are identical in their propensity to riot, equilibrium policy can be distorted. The evidence is consistent with these implications.</p>"

<p>We study how women's choices over labor activities in village economies correlate with poverty and whether enabling the poorest women to take on the activities of their richer counterparts can set them on a sustainable trajectory out of poverty. To do this we conduct a large-scale randomized control trial, covering over 21,000 households in 1,309 villages surveyed four times over a seven-year period, to evaluate a nationwide program in Bangladesh that transfers livestock assets and skills to the poorest women. At baseline, the poorest women mostly engage in low return and seasonal casual wage labor while wealthier women solely engage in livestock rearing. The program enables poor women to start engaging in livestock rearing, increasing their aggregate labor supply and earnings. This leads to asset accumulation (livestock, land, and business assets) and poverty reduction, both sustained after four and seven years. These gains do not crowd out the livestock businesses of noneligible households while the wages these receive for casual jobs increase as the poor reduce their labor supply. Our results show that (i) the poor are able to take on the work activities of the nonpoor but face barriers to doing so, and, (ii) one-off interventions that remove these barriers lead to sustainable poverty reduction.</p>"

We project the expected timing and number of pregnancies infected with ZIKV during the first trimester and provide estimates of microcephaly cases assuming different levels of risk as reported in empirical retrospective studies. Our approach represents a modeling effort aimed at understanding the potential magnitude and timing of the ZIKV epidemic and it can be potentially used as a template for the analysis of future mosquito-borne epidemics.</p>"

<p>Research summary: This study explores the effect of knowledge integration on strategic renewal. In particular, it examines how executives from different levels and sources influence renewal when added to top management teams (TMT). In contrast to prior work, the study hypothesizes and finds that new outside rookiesthose new to top management and the firmare associated with higher firm growth than other types of executives. We also find that seasoned outsidersthose with prior TMT experience outside the focal industrycontribute to growth only when the existing TMT has a long tenure. The results suggest that the ability of the TMT to integrate new members varies by executive type and has an important effect on incremental strategic renewal.Managerial summary: Conventional wisdom holds that firms are better off hiring those who can demonstrate prior experience and skill in tasks as close as possible to the job. In the realm of the top management team (TMT), however, we find that many firms benefit from hiring rookies from other firms who are new to the top management team level. These candidates bring useful knowledge of the operations of competitors and other firms, and they are easier to socialize and integrate with the existing team. While more experienced senior leaders may bring valuable strategic knowledge, this study suggests that only top management teams with long shared experience can weather the disruption that they cause to realize the potential benefits.

<p>This paper examines the effects of different public policies (strengthening capability building, favouring firms' learning, protectionism and support of entry of new domestic firms) on the catch-up of a latecomer with respect to an incumbent country in changing and uncertain technological environments. The effects of these policies are analysed with a simulation model first separately and then jointly to assess possible complementarities. We reach several results. First, we confirm that capability building and firms' learning are important drivers of catch-up. Second, we find that when a large technological discontinuity takes place, entry support favours catch-up while protectionism has the opposite effect. Protectionism favours catch-up only when no technological discontinuity opens up. Third, we find that depending on the technological conditions, different policy complementarities exist; therefore, different policy mixes should be at the base of a country catch-up strategy. These results add to the previous literature on public policy and catching up by developing countries in an industry by distinguishing the different effects of various types of public policy and relating them to the technological conditions that are present in an industry.</p>"

<p>In this paper we investigate whether coffee farms that have been granted in-house socio-environmental certification from a global buyer, display better social and environmental conduct compared to non-certified farms. We perform an econometric analysis using data from an original cross-country survey covering 575 farms in various regions of Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Mexico. We find that farms that have been granted in-house certification demonstrate better environmental but not better social conduct than non-certified farms. We find also that the positive relationship between in-house certification and environmental conduct is stronger if the farm sells to a cooperative, and if it is located in an institutionally weak country. Finally, we find that the institutional strength of the farm's home country has a positive influence on its social conduct. We discuss how our analysis contributes to the literature on the social and environmental impacts of certifications, and to scholarship in global value chains' social and environmental upgrading.

<p>The social cost of carbon (SCC) is a key tool in climate policy. The SCC expresses in monetary terms the social impact of the emission of a ton of CO2 in a given year. The SCC is calculated using a 'social welfare function' (SWF): a method for assessing social welfare. The dominant SWF in climate policy is the discounted-utilitarian SWF. Individuals' well-being numbers (utilities) are summed, and the values for later generations are reduced ('discounted'). This SWF has been criticized for ignoring the distribution of well-being and including an arbitrary time preference. Here, we use a 'prioritarian' SWF, with no time discount, to calculate the SCC. This SWF gives extra weight ('priority') to worse-off individuals. Prioritarianism is a well-developed concept in ethics and welfare economics, but has been rarely used in climate scholarship. We find substantial differences between the discounted-utilitarian and non-discounted prioritarian SCCs.</p>"

<p>Research summaryThis study develops a framework that links a typology of spinouts with distinct product/market strategies and the characteristics of localization economies to study location choice. Specifically, we examine focal spinouts and user-industry spinouts entry into generic and market-specific product categories and localization economies related to the focal industry and to downstream, user industries. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 413 spinouts in the U.S. semiconductor industry from 1997 to 2007. Our findings show that focal spinouts make different location choices than user-industry spinouts and that such choices are mediated by product strategy at entry. Our results contribute to the literatures on location choice and strategic entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Managerial summaryThis study concerns the location choices of different types of spinouts at the moment of entry. Our study suggests that location may be a key decision for entrepreneurs to increase their exposure to potential knowledge spillovers. Location, therefore, should not be taken as a given in either studies or business plans related to entrepreneurship. Rather, location needs to be treated as a strategic choice to be exercised by new firms as they enter an industry. Our research also underscores the importance of downstream industries both as a source of entrepreneurship and as a source of knowledge. In some cases, localization economies related to downstream industries might offer greater potential to entrants than localization economies related to the focal industry.

<p>Brokers are expected to be more creative than employees embedded in closed social structures because they occupy a position in the social space that provides them with access to non-redundant knowledge. However, the extant research provides partly inconsistent findings on the creative implications of brokerage, which raises important questions about when and how brokering between otherwise disconnected colleagues leads to individual creativity. We advance the relational perspective on individual creativity by adopting a contingency view, and showing that a curvilinear ( inverted U-shape) specification of the relationship between brokerage and creativity applies particularly when brokers work in research and development, as they are more likely to intensively exploit their structural opportunities. In addition, we show that brokers who work in research and development are more sensitive to work environments that protect their cognitive resources, such that they exhibit greater creativity when the work environment is free from environmental stressors, such as noise and disturbances. Thus, environmental stressors are particularly harmful for those employees who are most likely to exploit the opportunity to broker across otherwise disconnected colleagues.</p>"

<p>The function that accountants fulfil in the economic system is dependent on their ability to maintain the perception of high ethical standards. Building on the idea that birth cohorts, otherwise known as generations, are a useful proxy for the socio-cultural environment of different time periods, we focus on the so-called 'GenMe', that is, students and young workers born in the 1980s and 1990s. In particular, combining the accounting and business ethics literature, the purpose of our paper is to contribute to an increased awareness of the GenMe perceptions of accountants, with special attention given to ethical aspects. We believe that the perceptions of this age group are particularly crucial for the future of the accounting profession as it is these young people who will either become professional accountants or the accountants' future clients. Using an extensive database of 1,794 questionnaires, results show that the impression of the accountant as a corrupt professional is not dominant among GenMe and seem to suggest the existence of a multifaceted perception of accountants' ethics. Specifically, the factors that contribute to influencing GenMe perceptions of accountants' ethics are level of education, having attended an accounting course at high school level, gender, and belonging to the accounting profession. Finally, our study indicates that there is room for improving public perceptions of accountants' ethics through university courses in ethics, continuing education programs, and focused communication strategies by accounting firms and professional bodies.</p>"

<p>We study optimal taxation of savings in an economy where agents face self-control problems and the severity of these problems possibly depends on age. Focusing on quasi-hyperbolic discounting, we show that if agents' ability to self-control increases concavely with age, then savings should be subsidised and the subsidy should decrease with age. Quantitatively, we find that the optimal subsidies in our calibrated model with age-dependent self-control are much larger than those implied by models with constant self-control. Our optimal subsidies are of comparable magnitudes to those implied by the 401(k) plan, even though the latter prescribes subsidies increasing with age.</p>"

Furthermore, empowering behaviors positively moderate the effect of Lean Operations on workers' safety. The study bridges sustainable operations literature with theories related to the ethical side of safety management, sustainable HRM, ethical leadership, and empowerment.

The results show a general trend toward U but with significant variation across countries and time, including cases with a reversal of this trend.</p>"

Our results reveal that while capital expenditures are mostly idiosyncratic and related to unique property characteristics, they are a significant determinant of property returns. We find persistently strong positive relationship between capital expenditures and excess NPI returns when controlling for the endogeneity of capital expenditures for industrial, office and retail properties. A further analysis reveals that this relationship is driven by the positive impact of building improvements and building expansions, while returns in all property types do not fully adjust to account for tenant improvements.</p>"

<p>The Integrated Reporting Framework of 2013 represents the latest international attempt to connect a firm's financial and sustainability (i.e., environmental, social and governance) performance in one company report. An Integrated Report (IR) should communicate ""concisely"" about how a firm's strategy, governance, performance and prospects, in the context of its external environment, lead to the creation of sustainable value. At the same time, an IR needs to be ""complete and balanced"", i.e., broadly including all material matters, both positive and negative, in a balanced way. Drawing on impression management studies, we examine a selection of performance determinants to gain insights into the factors associated with conciseness, completeness and balance in IR. The results from a sample of IR early adopters show that in the presence of a firm's weak financial performance, the IR tends to be significantly longer and less readable (i.e., less concise), and more optimistic (i.e., less balanced). We additionally find that firms with worse social performance provide reports that are foggier (i.e., less concise) and with less information on their sustainability performance (i.e., less complete). Our evidence implies that IR early adopters employ quantity and syntactical reading ease manipulation as well as thematic content and verbal tone manipulation as impression management strategies. The results also suggest that such strategies depend not only on the level of firms' performance but also on the type of performance (financial versus nonfinancial/sustainability). This paper adds to the limited literature on IR in sustainability accounting as well as to the research in mainstream financial accounting that examines disclosure quality using textual analysis.

<p>To date, only a few studies have investigated the attitude of companies towards the EU Ecolabel. This article intends to provide an updated portrait of what are the main motivations that push companies to use the EU Ecolabel, the benefits that companies perceive as deriving from it and the barriers that companies perceive as hindering uptake. In order to answer to these research questions, we have used the data collected by the empirical survey on the EU Ecolabel that ran from April to July 2014. Evidence emerging from the survey shows that companies deem that the EU Ecolabel added-value lies in it being a useful ""showcase"" tool of their eco-innovation efforts, potentially able to close the information gap with the market (made of consumers above all, but also retailers and public procurers) about their products and services' environmental performance. However, there is evidence throughout the study that, although the EU Ecolabel brings some market rewards, these are fewer than those expected by companies when they first decide to apply for the EU Ecolabel. This is linked to the lack of awareness of the EU Ecolabel by consumers and to the insufficient and inadequate promotion and support granted by public institutions.</p>"

<p>The literature on business responses to climate change until now identified several drivers: regulatory changes; physical changes; product and technology innovation; operational efficiency; reputation; financial impacts; and changes in consumer needs. However, these studies are mainly based on qualitative research methods. Therefore, this study aims to investigate with a quantitative analysis the contextual drivers of multinational enterprises' responses to climate change considering the risks and opportunities identified by previous studies. The research is based on the Carbon Disclosure Project climate questionnaire of 2015, which includes information of 1896 companies within different industries and countries. The analyses highlight that the business continuity is mainly endangered by the physical changes; changes in demand for goods/services or new product/services correspond to market changes drivers; changes in market valuation correspond to reputation drivers. Finally, changes in operational costs and investment opportunity correspond to regulatory drivers. The study provides contributions to the literature on business responses to climate change and implications for business and public policy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

Findings on the effect of self-control depletion on unethical behavior are mixed.

Here we analyze the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), testing the hypothesis that lowering tariffs on food and beverage syrups that contain high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) increased its use in foods consumed in Canada.</p>
<p>METHODS: We used supply data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to assess changes in supply of caloric sweeteners including HFCS after NAFTA. We estimate the impact of NAFTA on supply of HFCS in Canada using an innovative, quasi-experimental methodology -synthetic control methods -that creates a control group with which to compare Canada's outcomes. Additional robustness tests were performed for sample, control groups and model specification.</p>
<p>RESULTS: Tariff reductions in NAFTA coincided with a 41.6 (95% confidence interval 25.1 to 58.2) kilocalorie per capita daily increase in the supply of caloric sweeteners including HFCS. This change was not observed in the control groups, including Australia and the United Kingdom, as well as a composite control of 16 countries. Results were robust to placebo tests and additional sensitivity analyses.</p>
<p>INTERPRETATION: NAFTA was strongly associated with a marked rise in HFCS supply and likely consumption in Canada. Our study provides evidence that even a seemingly modest change to product tariffs in free trade agreements can substantially alter population-wide dietary behaviour and exposure to risk factors.</p>"

<p>We analyzed the effects of 10,748 weather events on attention to climate change between December 2011 and November 2014 in local areas across the USA. Attention was gauged by quantifying the relative increase in Twitter messages about climate change in the local area around the time of each event. Coastal floods, droughts, wildfires, strong wind, hail, excessive heat, extreme cold, and heavy snow events all had detectable effects. Attention was reliably higher directly after events began, compared to directly before. Financial damage associated with the weather events had a positive and significant effect on attention, although the effect was small. The abnormality of each weather event's occurrence compared to local historical activity was also a significant predictor. In particular and in line with past research, relative abnormalities in temperature (local warming) generated attention to climate change. In contrast, wind speed was predictive of attention to climate change in absolute levels. These results can be useful to predict short-term attention to climate change for strategic climate communications and to better forecast long-term climate policy support.</p>"

<p>Public energy research and development (R&D) is recognized as a key policy tool for transforming the world's energy system in a cost-effective way. However, managing the uncertainty surrounding technological change is a critical challenge for designing robust and cost-effective energy policies. The design of such policies is particularly important if countries are going to both meet the ambitious greenhouse-gas emissions reductions goals set by the Paris Agreement and achieve the required harmonization with the broader set of objectives dictated by the Sustainable Development Goals. The complexity of informing energy technology policy requires, and is producing, a growing collaboration between different academic disciplines and practitioners. Three analytical components have emerged to support the integration of technological uncertainty into energy policy: expert elicitations, integrated assessment models, and decision frameworks. Here we review efforts to incorporate all three approaches to facilitate public energy R&D decision-making under uncertainty. We highlight emerging insights that are robust across elicitations, models, and frameworks, relating to the allocation of public R&D investments, and identify gaps and challenges that remain.</p>"

<p>The paper considers the austerity measures introduced in the wake of the financial and economic crisis in the late 2000s in relation to their distributional impact across households and potential effects on aggregate demand. We determine the size, composition and effects of fiscal consolidation using a 'bottom-up' measurement strategy and find notable cross-country variation. We show that while richer households tend to bear a greater burden in most countries, combined cuts in public wages and transfers are more likely to affect liquidity-constrained households and thereby aggregate demand, casting doubts on the presumed effectiveness of such measures for macro-economic recovery. This suggests that in order to reach robust policy conclusions it is important to consider the distributional patterns of detailed policy measures.</p>"

<p>We study the effects of a conventional monetary expansion, quantitative easing, and the maturity extension program on corporate bond yields using impulse response functions obtained from flexible models with regimes. Using a three-state Markov switching model with time-homogeneous vector autoregressive (VAR) coefficients that emerges from a systematic model specification search, we find that unconventional policies may have been generally expected to decrease both corporate yields and spreads. However, even though the sign of the responses is the one desired by policymakers, the size of the estimated effects depends on the assumptions regarding the decline in long-term Treasury yields caused by unconventional policies, on which considerable uncertainty remains. Further tests based on yield spreads and a variable that measures inflation expectations show that, in the crisis regime, unconventional monetary policies do not produce any perverse effects on expected inflation. These results prove robust to adopting a framework that allows VAR coefficients to break, to imposing coefficient restrictions that increase parsimony, and to a range of different ordering schemes that identify shocks in alternative ways.

<p>Pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to invest in research and development (R&D) of products for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) mainly due to the low ability-to-pay of health insurance systems and of potential consumers. The available preventive and curative interventions for NTDs mostly rely on old technologies and products that are often not adequate. Moreover, NTDs mostly affect populations living in remote rural areas and conflict zones, thereby hampering access to healthcare. The challenges posed by NTDs have led to the proliferation of a variety of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the last decades. We conducted a systematic review to assess the functioning and impact of these partnerships on the development of and access to better technologies for NTDs. Our systematic review revealed a clear lack of empirical assessment of PPP5: we could not find any impact evaluation analyses, while these are crucial to realize the full potential of PPP5 and to progress further towards NTDs elimination.

<p>Ethnic diversity has been linked to important social outcomes such as economic underperformance and civil war, yet its study is still hampered by conceptual difficulties and imprecise measurement. In this paper, a modified understanding of ethnic diversity is developed. Ethnic diversity is disaggregated into two components-first- and second-order ethnic diversity which have opposing consequences for collective outcomes. While first-order ethnic diversity the diversity of a local community is theorized to undermine cooperation, second-order ethnic diversity the ethnic diversity of the hinterland of a community is theorized to induce ethnic competition, thereby reinforcing cooperation. ""Relating data from over 100,000 individuals interviewed at 2,942 locations in 33 African countries to novel sub national indicators of first- and second-order ethno-linguistic diversity, the theory is tested and its basic tenets confirmed. In a next step, I show that it is indeed ethnic competition that accounts for the positive association between second-order diversity and increased cooperation: second-order ethnic diversity is a much better predictor of cooperation in regions where contemporary or historical factors have exacerbated interethnic tensions. The paper sheds new light on the debate on the consequences of ethnic diversity for cooperation and contributes to our understanding of the origins of the global 'geography of social capital'.

<p>Does inventor centrality foster regional innovation? The case of the Swiss medical devices sector. Regional Studies. This paper contributes an empirical analysis to the discussion of the impact of inventors' collaboration networks on regional innovation. More precisely, it investigates how inventors' degree centrality in the regional co-invention network, and inventors' cross-regional linkages, influence innovation in the Swiss medical devices sector. The results show that high values of inventor centrality and the presence of cross-regional linkages have mutually reinforcing effects on innovation. These findings provide insights for policy-makers designing policy to encourage regional innovation.</p>"

<p>Objective. To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of mud-bath therapy (MBT) in addition to usual treatment compared to usual treatment alone in patients with bilateral knee osteoarthritis (OA).</p>
<p>Methods. An economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial was conducted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a 2-week cycle of MBT in addition to their usual treatment or to continue routine care alone. The EuroQol 5-domain questionnaire was administered at baseline, 2 weeks, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Direct health care resource consumption data up until 12 months were derived from a daily diary given to patients and returned at prescheduled followup visits.</p>
<p>Results. A total of 103 patients were included (n=53 for MBT patients; n=50 for controls). Overall, patients in the MBT group accrued mean +/- SD 0.835 +/- 0.10 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to 0.753 +/- 0.11 in the control group (P<0.001). Average direct costs per patient ((sic)303 versus (sic)975; P<0.001) were higher in the control group, primarily because of hospitalization for total knee replacement and use of intraarticular hyaluronic acid. Bootstrapping replications of costs and QALY sample distributions consistently indicated that the MBT therapy combined with standard therapy represents a dominant strategy as compared with standard therapy alone. The probability of MBT being cost-effective at standard cost-effectiveness thresholds (e.g., (sic)20,000/QALY) is 100%.</p>
<p>Conclusion. The results of this cost-effectiveness analysis support the use of MBT as midterm complementary therapy in the management of knee OA.</p>"

<p>In many service contexts, customers share the service setting with other customers. However, knowledge about the influences of fellow customers' copresence remains largely fragmented. We address this deficiency by introducing the integrative concept of customer copresence influence modes (CCIMs) and investigate its potential consequences for service perceptions and evaluations. Following a grounded theory approach and drawing on in-depth, qualitative interviews with both managers and customers of a leading service company, we develop a typology of CCIMs, categorizing the various ways-interactions (reactive/proactive and social/instrumental), observations (information-seeking/comparative), and spillovers (spatial/behavioral)-in which fellow customers might influence the focal customer. Building on this typology, we propose a conceptual framework with a set of testable propositions about consequences of CCIMs for the focal customer's service experience and the service provider's image. The CCIM typology and propositional inventory, in addition to offering directions for further research, emphasize the need for service managers to pay special attention to customer copresence because (1) its influence on service experience is contingent on a variety of factors, including some within the managers' control, and (2) customers might assign responsibility to the service provider for both desirable and detrimental effects of customer copresence.</p>"

<p>Objectives: There are no commonly accepted standards for monitoring patients treated for head and neck cancer. The aim of this study was to assess patients' preferences for different aspects of follow-up. Methods: A best-worst survey was conducted in a sample of head and neck cancer patients in clinical follow-up at the National Cancer Institute (Milan, Italy). Conditional logit regression with choice as the dependent variable was run to analyse the data. A covariate-adjusted analysis was performed in order to identify socio-demographic and clinical factors related to the selection of best-worst items. The participants were asked to report any difficulties encountered during the survey. Results: A total of 143 patients, predominantly male (74%) and with a mean age of 58 years were enrolled in the survey. The strongest positive preference was expressed for a hospital-based program of physical examinations with frequency decreasing over time. Conversely, the lowest valued item was not performing any positron emission tomography (PET) scan during follow-up. Patients with high educational levels were more likely to value attending a primary care-based program and undergoing intensive radiological investigations. Other patient-specific variables significantly associated with the choice of items were employment and living status, time already spent in follow-up and number of treatments received. Conclusions: Overall, patients were more likely to choose an intensive follow-up scheme broadly consistent with the program currently administered by the hospital. There is little evidence of preference heterogeneity that might justify customized programs based on demographics. The best-worst scaling task appeared feasible for most participants.</p>"

<p>Objectives: To better understand the reasons for differences in reimbursement decisions for orphan drugs in four European countries that were not readily apparent from health technology assessment (HTA) reports and operating procedures. Methods: Semistructured interviews with representatives of HTA bodies in England, Scotland, Sweden, and France were conducted. An interview topic guide was developed on the basis of findings from a systematic comparison of HTA decisions for 10 orphan drugs. Qualitative thematic data analysis was applied to the interview transcripts using the framework approach. Results: Eight representatives from the four HTA bodies were interviewed between March and June 2015. Evidentiary requirements and approaches to dealing with imperfect or incomplete evidence were explored, including trial design and duration, study population and subgroups, comparators, and end points. Interviewees agreed that decisions regarding orphan drugs are made in a context of lower quality evidence, and the threshold of acceptable uncertainty varied by country. Some countries imposed higher evidentiary standards for greater clinical claims, which may be more challenging for orphan diseases. The acceptability of surrogate end points was not consistent across countries nor were the validation requirements. The most common social value judgments identified related to innovation, disease severity, and unmet need. Differences were seen in the way these concepts were defined and accounted for across countries. Conclusions: Although agreement was seen in evidentiary requirements or preferences, there were subtle differences in the circumstances in which uncertain evidence may be considered acceptable, possibly explaining differences in HTA recommendations across countries.</p>"

<p>Research summary: This article studies strategic interactions between firms that form alliances to exploit synergistic benefits. Firms cooperate to create value, but they can also compete to capture value. Fundamental questions rarely addressed by strategy scholars relate to how the configuration of control over resources influences firms' strategies, the potential for termination, and the emergence of cooperation and trust. The formal results reveal crucial aspects of the interorganizational rent-generating process and yield testable implications. With greater synergistic benefits, firms invest more, but they also compete more intensively to capture more value. With symmetric control, more value gets created, which limits the potential for termination, but also exacerbates the competition for value; from a relational perspective, this form of control augments the calculative rationale of cooperation and trust.</p>
<p>Managerial summary: When forming an alliance to exploit synergies, firms engage in a complicated strategic interaction that is part cooperation and part competition. What happens when partner firms cooperate and invest to create value while competing and using costly adversarial tactics to capture value? The analysis reveals that with greater synergistic benefits, firms invest more in value creation, but the fear of opportunism pushes them to waste more resources on value capture tactics. The balance between value creation and value capture, and the possibility that the alliance is terminated depend on the configuration of control over resources. The analysis further reveals under what conditions there can be trust between the partners, such that they focus on value creation and avoid wasting resources in the competition for value.

The training was evaluated by participants as generally very successful in terms of improving the importance, awareness and competence of their knowledge and skills, with a statistically significant difference in the pre-/post-analyses (no decreases occurred). Different professional groups performed differently in the pre-training self-rating scores. The participants in some countries were mainly drawn from one professional group (i.e. teachers in Finland, social workers in Germany and psychologists in Poland).

<p>This paper proposes the use of Bayesian model averaging (BMA) as an alternative tool to forecast GDP relative to simple bridge models and factor models. BMA is a computationally feasible method that allows us to explore the model space even in the presence of a large set of candidate predictors. We test the performance of BMA in now-casting by means of a recursive experiment for the euro area and the three largest countries. This method allows flexibility in selecting the information set month by month. We find that BMA-based forecasts produce smaller forecast errors than standard bridge model when forecasting GDP in Germany, France and Italy. At the same time, it also performs as well as medium-scale factor models when forecasting Eurozone GDP.</p>"

<p>This article unpacks the concept of cooperation in management. To stimulate future research, we illustrate the different conceptualizations of cooperation in strategic management, organization theory, and behavioral economics, and the unique insights that each discipline offers. Based on this account, we discuss overlaps and differences in how the concept has been used in these fields and across their different levels of theory and analysis. By taking strategic alliances and other interfirm relations as an exemplary illustration, we elaborate a research agenda on how the understanding of cooperation at each level of analysis-firm/alliance, work group/team, individual and interindividual-would benefit from greater integration of knowledge from other levels. Borrowing from the different disciplines, we explicate the social mechanisms-and related research directions-determining cooperation and their outcomes across levels: from macro-to-micro (e.g., explaining how cultural issues, different alliance structures, and organizational designs affect the cooperative behavior of interfirm team members); micro-to-micro (e.g., how individual motivation to cooperate or defect, or how different leadership styles, affect interfirm team members' collaboration); and micro-to-macro (e.g., how self-interested individuals who identify with their firm can be aggregated into collaborative interfirm bureaucracies). The emerging framework contributes to the understanding of the micro foundations of management phenomena by placing cooperative relationships between and among persons at center stage in explaining how organizational outcomes are generated.</p>"

<p>Despite being the main thriving force behind economic growth and industrial development, technological innovation remains highly concentrated on a handful of countries. It is therefore of a great interest to know how countries accumulate and develop their innovative capabilities, what kind of obstacles they need to overcome, and whether it is possible to identify opportunities to develop new areas of technological specialization. In this paper we analyze countries' patterns of technological diversification and specialization along the development process. We provide evidence regarding the importance of existing technological capabilities and the relationship among technologies in shaping possible paths of technological development. We show that the likelihood of diversification is higher for those technologies that are related to countries' existing profile of competences. Moreover, we show this effect to be stronger at earlier stages of development.

<p>Background Although rabbit anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATLG) is largely used for the prevention of immune-mediated complications in patients given allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) from an unrelated donor, the optimum dose of this drug in children is still undefined. We aimed to test whether a higher dose of ATLG was superior to a lower dose for prevention of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).</p>
<p>Methods We conducted a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial in seven Italian centres comparing two different doses of ATLG (30 mg/kg vs 15 mg/kg, given intravenously over 3 days, from day -4 to -2) in children (aged 0-18 years) with haematological malignancies transplanted from an unrelated donor, selected using high-resolution typing for HLA-class I/II loci. All patients received a myeloablative regimen and cyclosporine-A plus short-term methotrexate as post-transplantation GVHD prophylaxis. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either of the two groups and were stratified by the degree of HLA-compatibility with their donor, the source of haemopoietic stem cells used (bone marrow vs peripheral blood stem cells), and the disease risk category. The randomisation was open label; all investigators were aware of the treatment allocation. The primary endpoint of the study was 100-day cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD. Statistical analyses were done according to the per-protocol principle. Other outcomes included cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD, non-relapse mortality, disease recurrence, and probability of overall survival and event-free survival. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00934557.</p>
<p>Findings Between Jan 15, 2008, and Sept 25, 2012, 89 patients were randomly assigned to the 30 mg/kg ATLG group and 91 to the 15 mg/kg ATLG group; 84 patients in the 30 mg/kg ATLG group and 88 in the 15 mg/kg ATLG group were included in the analysis. The median follow-up for the whole study population was 3.4 years (IQR 1.7-5.1). The 100-day cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 36% (95% CI 28-48) in the 15 mg/kg ATLG group and 29% (20-40) in the 30 mg/kg ATLG group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.44-1.25; p=0.26). The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was 9% (5-18) in the 15 mg/kg ATLG group and 19% (12-30) in the 30 mg/kg ATLG group (HR 2.08, 0.89-4.96; p=0.092). Cumulative incidence of disease recurrence was 15% (12-24): 14% (8-23) in the 15 mg/kg ATLG group versus 20% (13-31) in the 30 mg/kg ATLG group (HR 1.54, 0.74-3.21; p=0.25). The 5-year overall survival probability was 70% (62-77) for the whole study population: 78% (69-87) in the 15 mg/kg ATLG group versus 62% (50-73) in the 30 mg/kg ATLG group (HR 1.80, 1.01-3.20; p=0.45). The 5-year event-free survival was 77% for children in the 15 mg/kg ATLG group versus 61% in the 30 mg/kg ATLG group (HR 1.87, 1.07-3.28; p=0.028).</p>

<p>Background: Mixing patterns of human populations play a crucial role in shaping the spreading paths of infectious diseases. The diffusion of mobile and wearable devices able to record close proximity interactions represents a great opportunity for gathering detailed data on social interactions and mixing patterns in human populations. The aim of this study is to investigate how social interactions are affected by the onset of symptomatic conditions and to what extent the heterogeneity in human behavior can reflect a different risk of infection.</p>
<p>Methods: We study the relation between individuals' social behavior and the onset of different symptoms, by making use of data collected in 2009 among students sharing a dormitory in a North America university campus. The dataset combines Bluetooth proximity records between study participants with self-reported daily records on their health state. Specifically, we investigate whether individuals' social activity significantly changes during different symptomatic conditions, including those defining Influenza-like illness, and highlight to what extent possible heterogeneities in social behaviors among individuals with similar age and daily routines may be responsible for a different risk of infection for influenza.</p>
<p>Results: Our results suggest that symptoms associated with Influenza-like illness can be responsible of a reduction of about 40% in the average duration of contacts and of 30% in the daily time spent in social interactions, possibly driven by the onset of fever. However, differences in the number of daily contacts were found to be not statistically significant. In addition, we found that individuals who experienced clinical influenza during the study period were characterized by a significantly higher social activity. In particular, both the number of person-to-person contacts and the time spent in social interactions emerged as significant risk factors for influenza infection.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Our findings highlight that Influenza-like illness can remarkably reduce the social activity of individuals and strengthen the idea that the heterogeneity in social habits among individuals can significantly contribute in shaping differences among the individuals' risk of infection.</p>"

<p>Sales organizations aim to grow their firms' business by acquiring new customers while retaining their existing ones. Although customer acquisition and retention are complementary processes, they involve different sales process capabilities that often compete for investments. However, firms that succeed in effectively combining these capabilities are ""ambidextrous"" and will enjoy superior growth and profits. Although developing ambidexterity is a fundamental sales management task, it has received little attention in research. Based on the Motivation -Opportunity-Ability framework we identify a set of organizational sales capabilities that can help sales organizations' joint management of acquisition and retention capabilities, and explain their influence drawing on Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) theory. Survey and time-lagged archival performance data from 174 firms provide an empirical test of the conceptual model and hypotheses developed. Results confirm that incentive management, cross functional cooperation, and the interaction of cross functional cooperation and sales training capabilities are positively correlated with sales organization ambidexterity. In addition, we find a positive correlation of customer prioritization on ambidextrous selling. Results confirm that firms with high levels and aligned acquisition and retention capabilities enjoy superior organic growth. However, contrary to expectation, increases in profit growth are only accomplished if acquisition capabilities are high. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>A commonly held view is that strategic organization theories progress as a result of a Popperian process of bold conjectures and systematic refutations. However, our field also witnesses vibrant debates or disputes about the specific assumptions that our theories rely on, and although these debates are often decoupled from the results of empirical testing, changes in assumptions seem closely intertwined with theoretical progress. Using the case of the resource-based view, we suggest that progressive change in theories of strategic organization may come about as a result of scholarly debate and dispute over what constitutes proper assumptionseven in the absence of corroborating or falsifying empirical evidence. We also discuss how changing assumptions may drive future progress in the resource-based view.</p>"

A qualitative study of the Lombardy system, with a focus on the municipality of Milan, is relied upon in order to explore the extent to which the principles of quasi-market and multi-level governance pursued by the regional government are allowed to co-exist in practice. Here, sub-regional levels of government are directly involved in services provision, but enjoy a more privileged condition relative to the private providers, thereby jeopardizing the implementation of an effective quasi-market. The article contributes to existing theories by suggesting that horizontal subsidiarity and marketization cannot neglect multi-level governance in those sectors where public bodies at various levels of government are directly involved in implementation.</p>"

<p>Inverse problems in statistical physics are motivated by the challenges of 'big data' in different fields, in particular high-throughput experiments in biology. In inverse problems, the usual procedure of statistical physics needs to be reversed: Instead of calculating observables on the basis of model parameters, we seek to infer parameters of a model based on observations. In this review, we focus on the inverse Ising problem and closely related problems, namely how to infer the coupling strengths between spins given observed spin correlations, magnetizations, or other data. We review applications of the inverse Ising problem, including the reconstruction of neural connections, protein structure determination, and the inference of gene regulatory networks. For the inverse Ising problem in equilibrium, a number of controlled and uncontrolled approximate solutions have been developed in the statistical mechanics community. A particularly strong method, pseudolikelihood, stems from statistics. We also review the inverse Ising problem in the non-equilibrium case, where the model parameters must be reconstructed based on non-equilibrium statistics.</p>"

<p>This work analyzes the perception that early twentieth-century American economists had of the influence of German Historicism on the development and institutionalization of American economics from the 1880s to the 1900s. Starting from the first two quantitative analyses of the migration of young American economists to Germany for post-graduate training, made by Henry Walcott Farnam and by Jack Myles in, respectively, 1908 and 1956, the article presents for the first time a complete transcription of both Farnam's archival material and Myles's data. Specifically, the artide proposes a survey of the Farnam papers from the various perspectives that, for contemporary historiography, represent the signs of the development and institutionalization of American economics along German lines. The particular focus of the essay concerns the extent and nature of the gap between our image today of the German influence on early twentieth-century American economics and the image that prevailed of that influence among early twentieth-century American economists.</p>"

<p>Small vector autoregressions are commonly used in macroeconomics for forecasting and evaluating shock transmission. This requires VAR parameters to be stable over the evaluation and forecast sample or modeled as time-varying. Prior work has considered whether there were sizable parameter changes in the early 1980s and in the subsequent period until the beginning of the new century. This paper conducts a similar analysis focused on the period since the recent crisis. Using a range of techniques, we provide substantial evidence against parameter stability. The evolution of the unemployment rate seems particularly different relative to its past behavior. We also evaluate alternative methods to handle parameter instability in a forecasting context.

If cities are viewed as the ""ecosystem of ecosystems,"" then successful city governance requires an orchestration approach where leaders choose the appropriate structure and manage the ecosystem dynamically in a constantly changing environment.</p>"

<p>The impact of big data on innovation is not only driven by technology and analytics. It involves a transformation of the organizational culture, structures, processes, roles, and capabilities that underpin the innovation process. Understanding these factors is particularly important for service innovators, given the strong interdependence between the organizational context and technology in service companies. Moreover, in many of these organizations, the innovation process is still deeply rooted in a non-digital past. This study answers the call to understand what are the key characteristics of a systematic process for service innovation in data-rich environments. In particular, the authors investigate the primary factors that enable existing service organizations to capture the innovation potential inherent in data-rich environments. To this aim, the authors implemented a two-step research design. First, they integrated the service innovation and information systems literatures in a unified conceptual framework that articulates the relationship between data-rich environments and service innovation from an organizational perspective. Second, they carried out 40 semi-structured interviews in seven large service firms, which allowed them to refine and populate the initial framework with typologies, concepts, and examples from the field. A major contribution of this study is to articulate the concept of data density, as three distinct processes (pattern spotting, real-time decisioning, and synergistic exploration) connecting data-rich environments with service innovation opportunities. Finally, the authors identified a set of organizational enablers that facilitate the links among technology, data density processes, and service innovation. The findings of this study offer a roadmap for service managers who need to align the service innovation process of their organizations with the opportunities offered by data-rich environments.</p>"

<p>International mobility of people brings great opportunities and large overall benefits. Economically stagnant areas, however, may be deprived of talent through emigration. This may harm dynamism and political and economic change. Between 2010 and 2014, Italy experienced a large wave of emigration and two deep recessions and significant political change. Combining administrative data on Italian expatriates and data on characteristics of municipal councils, mayors and on local elections, we analyse whether emigration affected political change. Economic pull factors from foreign countries, interacted with the pre-existing networks of emigration from Italian municipalities allow us to construct a proxy for emigration that is municipality-specific and, as we show, independent of pre-existing political and economic trends. Using this proxy as an instrument, we find that municipalities with larger emigration rates had slower growth in the share of young, college educated and women among local elected officials. They were also more likely to have their municipal council dismissed and experienced lower political participation and a lower share of votes to anti-status-quo parties.</p>"

Using a well-established panel survey-the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey (ERHS)-we investigate the empirical relationship between fertility and life satisfaction in rural Ethiopia, the largest landlocked country in Africa. Consistent with the fertility theories for developing countries and with the sociodemographic characteristics of rural Ethiopia, we hypothesize that this relationship varies by gender and across life stages, being more positive for men and for parents in old age. Indeed, our results suggest that older men benefit the most in terms of life satisfaction from having a large number of children, while the recent birth of a child is detrimental for the subjective well-being of women at reproductive ages. We address endogeneity issues by using lagged life satisfaction in ordinary least squares regressions, through fixed-effects estimation and the use of instrumental variables.</p>"

We find that green product and service innovation is primarily relevant to the creation of green jobs. The interaction term between an environmental management system and product and service innovations has a positive and significant effect on the decision to hire for green jobs. We also conduct a deep analysis of the subset of firms that produce green products and services, which reveals some idiosyncratic features.

<p>The aim of this study is to understand the effects of different capacity management strategies on the well-being of employees in long-term healthcare organizations. Such strategies may produce psychological effects in terms of job satisfaction and well-being among employees, namely frontline employees, thus affecting service quality. We collected 2158 observations from 42 nursing homes in Italy. Our results show that ail capacity management strategies addressed in this study can influence the perceived degree of fatigue or of job hazard, and some of them can influence both. Moreover, a better perception of job hazard and fatigue leads to a higher degree of reported well-being from employees, although with the former, it is only through the mediation of job satisfaction. We conclude our paper by discussing theoretical contributions and policy implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>The experimental literature has identified the Bomb Crater Effect (BoCE), i.e., the fact that tax compliance drops immediately after a taxpayer is audited. From a theoretical perspective, BoCE has been explained either by the misperception of chance, also known as the gambler's fallacy, or by the loss repair effect. The aim of this paper is to look more closely at the former. We run a laboratory experiment in which the information set is relatively rich but the implementation of the Bayesian updating process is fairly simple. By doing so, we are able to elicit a range of consistent but heterogeneous probability beliefs and to distinguish between Bayesian and non-Bayesian subjects. We obtain two major results concerning Bayesian subjects. First, they exhibit a strong and robust short-run BoCE. Second, they are seemingly not affected by the audits of other taxpayers in their compliance decision. These results are robust to different definitions of Bayesianity as well as to different specifications and conflict with the evidence that Bayesian agents correctly perceive the chance of being audited. In turn, these findings suggest that the existing explanations of the BoCE are not satisfactory and that alternative theories are needed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>This article studies the emergence of cultural homogeneity in personal norms when the behavior of heterogeneous individuals is driven both by economic incentives and by personal norms. Agents participate in a team production game by choosing their level of costly effort. Norms evolve along the life cycle of the individuals according to two psychological forces: cognitive dissonance or consistency and informational conformity. The model sheds light on how primitive economic and behavioral parameters such as the distribution of skills, the income distribution, and the levels of materialism, conformism, and consistency in the group determine the long-run culture and its degree of cultural homogeneity.</p>"

Drawing on institutional logic and signaling theory, we investigate sources of heterogeneity in the impacts of environmental actions on environmental legitimacy. Longitudinal data (1997-2001) about 325 publicly traded U.S. firms in polluting industries support the notion that environmental actions help firms gain environmental legitimacy. However, some actions instead can harm this legitimacy if environmental performance deteriorates and the firm is subject to intense scrutiny from nongovernmental organizations. Thus, an important contribution of this research is to identify conditions under which green-washing can backfire.</p>"

<p>Background: In several health systems of advanced countries, reforms have changed primary care in the last two decades. The literature has assessed the effects of a variety of interventions and individual factors on the behavior of general practitioners (GPs). However, there has been a lack of investigation concerning the influence of the resources embedded in the GPs' personal advice networks (i.e., social capital) on GPs' capacity to meet defined objectives.</p>
<p>The present study has two goals: (a) to assess the GPs' personal advice networks according to the social capital framework and (b) to test the influence of such relationships on GPs' capacity to accomplish organizational goals.</p>
<p>Methods: The data collection relied on administrative data provided by an Italian local health authority (LHA) and a survey administered to the GPs of the selected LHA. The GPs' personal advice networks were assessed through an ad-hoc instrument and interpreted as egocentric networks. Multivariate regression analyses assessed two different performance measures.</p>
<p>Results: Social capital may influence the GPs' capacity to meet targets, though the influence differs according to the objective considered. In particular, the higher the professional heterogeneity of a GP personal advice network, the lower her/his capacity is to meet targets of prescriptive appropriateness.</p>
<p>Conclusions: Our findings might help to design more effective primary care reforms depending on the pursued goals. However, further research is needed.</p>"

<p>Traditional nonparametric frontier techniques to measure hospital efficiency have been criticized for their deterministic nature and the inability to incorporate external factors into the analysis. Moreover, efficiency estimates represent a relative measure meaning that the implications from a hospital efficiency analysis based on a single-country dataset are limited by the availability of suitable benchmarks. Our first objective is to demonstrate the application of advanced nonparametric methods that overcome the limitations of the traditional nonparametric frontier techniques. Our second objective is to provide guidance on how an international comparison of hospital efficiency can be conducted using the example of two countries: Italy and Germany. We rely on a partial frontier of order-m to obtain efficiency estimates robust to outliers and extreme values. We use the conditional approach to incorporate hospital and regional characteristics into the estimation of efficiency. The obtained conditional efficiency estimates may deviate from the traditional unconditional efficiency estimates, which do not account for the potential influence of operational environment on the production possibilities. We nonparametrically regress the ratios of conditional to unconditional efficiency estimates to examine the relation of hospital and regional characteristics with the efficiency performance. We show that the two countries can be compared against a common frontier when the challenges of international data compatibility are successfully overcome. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the production possibilities of Italian and German hospitals. Moreover, hospital characteristics, particularly bed-size category, ownership status, and specialization, are significantly related to differences in efficiency performance across the analyzed hospitals.</p>"

<p>While much prosocial behavior has traditionally taken place in non-market contexts, such as families, clans, and social associations, it is in increasingly brought into the market context. For example, companies increasingly promote their products and services by engaging in charitable giving and policy makers increasingly push for the implementation of market-driven prosocial initiatives. However, this trend has occurred without being informed by evidence on how the market influences individuals' engagement in prosocial behavior. Using a public goods game that simulates a market and a non-market context, we analyze prosocial behavior and its psychological underpinnings across these two contexts. First, we find that prosocial behavior occurs at lower levels in markets than non-markets. Second, we find that individuals' beliefs about prosocial norms are more important for prosocial behavior in markets than non-markets, while the opposite is true for their autonomous motivation towards prosocial behavior. This suggests that decision-makers need to adjust the means to foster prosocial behavior, depending on the institutional context deemed appropriate for specific prosocial behaviors.</p>"

<p>Background</p>
<p>The pathogenesis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) remains unclear which limits both early diagnosis and prognostication. The responsiveness to intervention of differing, complex and concurrent injury patterns on imaging have not been well-characterized. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to explore the topography and reversibility of white matter injury in NPH pre-and early after shunting.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Twenty-five participants (sixteen NPH patients and nine healthy controls) underwent DTI, pre-operatively and at two weeks post-intervention in patients. We interrogated 40 datasets to generate a full panel of DTI measures and corroborated findings with plots of isotropy (p) vs. anisotropy (q).</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Concurrent examination of DTI measures revealed distinct profiles for NPH patients vs. controls. PQ plots demonstrated that patterns of injury occupied discrete white matter districts. DTI profiles for different white matter tracts showed changes consistent with i) predominant transependymal diffusion with stretch/compression, ii) oedema with or without stretch/compression and iii) predominant stretch/compression. Findings were specific to individual tracts and dependent upon their proximity to the ventricles. At two weeks post-intervention, there was a 6.7% drop in axial diffusivity (p = 0.022) in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, compatible with improvement in stretch/compression, that preceded any discernible changes in clinical outcome. On PQ plots, the trajectories of the posterior limb of the internal capsule and inferior longitudinal fasciculus suggested attempted 'round trips'. i.e. return to normality.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>DTI profiling with p:q correlation may offer a non-invasive biomarker of the characteristics of potentially reversible white matter injury.</p>"

<p>Objectives. Our aimswere to (1) measure quality of life (QoL) in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients using differentmethods and analyze differences; (2) enable targeted treatments by identifying variables that affectQoL; and (3) provide decision-makers with useful data for cost-utility analyses in SCI population. Methods. Seventy-one participants were enrolled. The computer-based tool UceWeb was used to elicit QoL in terms of utility coefficients, through the standard gamble, time trade-off, and rating scale methods. The SF36 questionnaire was also administered. Statistical analyses were performed to find predictors of QoL among collected variables. Results. Median values for rating scale, time trade-off, and standard gamble were 0.60, 0.82, and 0.85, respectively. All scales were significantly correlated. Rating scale and SF36 provided similar values, significantly lower than the other methods. Impairment level, male gender, older age, living alone, and higher education were correlated with lower QoL but accounted for only 20% of the variation in utility coefficients. Conclusions. Demographic and clinical variables are useful to predict QoL but do not completely capture utility coefficients variability. Therefore, direct preference-based utility elicitation should be strengthened. Finally, this is the first study providing data that can be used as a reference for cost-utility analyses in the Italian SCI population.</p>"

<p>Medical errors are a major source of preventable morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Voluntary reporting systems are useful data sources that collect detailed information on the circumstances of medical errors occurring in hospitals. Identifying the characteristics of errors that frequently result in patient harm when they occur would allow investigators to prioritize among the many sources of potential errors and design targeted prevention strategies. In this paper, we use data from MEDMARX, a large anonymous and voluntary reporting system for medication errors, to identify the combinations of error characteristics that are more likely to result in harm. To this end, we consider a Bayesian hierarchical model with crossed random effects and a flexible specification of the random effects distribution. We then provide a ranking of the errors using optimal Bayesian ranking based on their probability of harm. The use of optimal Bayesian ranking accounts for the varying amount of uncertainty across the random effects estimates. Finally, we examine the sensitivity of results to different specifications of the random effects distributions. The utility of flexible random effects assumptions is illustrated by empirically comparing results under several choices. We found that errors caused by mistakes in reconciling a patient's current medication list with the medications prescribed at hospital discharge have an estimated 10.5% probability of harm. These errors had the highest rate of harm of errors that occur during the prescribing stage of medication use. In addition, we found that the results are sensitive to the random effects distribution used in estimation. Thus, an approach that explores this sensitivity is important for accurately comparing the relative harm across errors.</p>"

<p>This article provides an overview of long-term changes in the relative conditions of the rich in preindustrial Europe. It covers four pre-unification Italian states (Sabaudian State, Florentine State, Kingdom of Naples and Republic of Venice) as well as other areas of Europe (Low Countries, Catalonia) during the period 1300-1800. Three different kinds of indicators are measured systematically and combined in the analysis: headcount indexes, the share of the top rich, and richness indexes. Taken together, they suggest that overall, during the entirety of the early modern period the rich tended to become both more prevalent and more distanced from the other strata of society. The only period during which the opposite process took place was the late Middle Ages, following the Black Death epidemic of the mid-fourteenth century. In the period from ca. 1500 to 1800, the prevalence of the rich doubled. In the Sabaudian State, the Florentine State and the Kingdom of Naples, for which reconstructions of regional wealth distributions exist, in about the same period the share of the top 10 % grew from 45-55 to 70-80 %-reaching almost exactly the same level which has recently been suggested as the European average at 1810. Consequently, the time series presented here might be used to add about five centuries of wealth inequality trends to current debates on very long-term changes in the relative position of the rich.</p>"

<p>We find that health cost risk lowers optimal annuity demand at retirement. If medical expenses can be sizeable early in retirement, full annuitisation at retirement is no longer optimal because agents do not have enough time to build a liquid wealth buffer. Furthermore, large deviations from optimal annuitisation levels lead to small utility differences. Our results suggest that health cost risk can explain a large proportion of empirically observed annuity choices. Finally, allowing additional annuitisation after retirement results in welfare gains of at most 2.5% when facing health cost risk, and negligible gains without this risk.</p>"

<p>Background: Health state utility values (HSUVs) are essential parameters in model-based economic evaluations. This study systematically identifies HSUVs in head and neck cancer and provides guidance for selecting them from a growing body of health-related quality of life studies.</p>
<p>Methods: We systematically reviewed the published literature by searching PubMed, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library using a pre-defined combination of keywords. The Tufts Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry and the School of Health and Related Research Health Utilities Database (ScHARRHUD) specifically containing health utilities were also queried, in addition to the Health Economics Research Centre database of mapping studies. Studies were considered for inclusion if reporting original HSUVs assessed using established techniques. The characteristics of each study including country, design, sample size, cancer subsite addressed and demographics of responders were summarized narratively using a data extraction form. Quality scoring and critical appraisal of the included studies were performed based on published recommendations.</p>
<p>Results: Of a total 1048 records identified by the search, 28 studies qualified for data extraction and 346 unique HSUVs were retrieved from them. HSUVs were estimated using direct methods (e.g. standard gamble; n = 10 studies), multi-attribute utility instruments (MAUIs; n = 13) and mapping techniques (n = 3); two studies adopted both direct and indirect approaches. Within the MAUIs, the EuroQol 5-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) was the most frequently used (n = 11), followed by the Health Utility Index Mark 3 (HUI3; n = 2), the 15D (n = 2) and the Short Form-Six Dimension (SF-6D; n = 1). Different methods and types of responders (i.e. patients, healthy subjects, clinical experts) influenced the magnitude of HSUVs for comparable health states. Only one mapping study developed an original algorithm using head and neck cancer data. The identified studies were considered of intermediate quality.</p>
<p>Discussion: This review provides a dataset of HSUVs systematically retrieved from published studies in head and neck cancer. There is currently a lack of research for some disease phases including recurrent and metastatic cancer, and treatment-related complications. In selecting HSUVs for cost-effectiveness modeling purposes, preference should be given to EQ-5D utility values; however, mapping to EQ-5D is a potentially valuable technique that should be further developed in this cancer population.</p>"

<p>For the most popular discrete nonparametric models, beyond the Dirichlet process, the prior guess at the shape of the data-generating distribution, also known as the base measure, is assumed to be diffuse. Such a specification greatly simplifies the derivation of analytical results, allowing for a straightforward implementation of Bayesian nonparametric inferential procedures. However, in several applied problems the available prior information leads naturally to the incorporation of an atom into the base measure, and then the Dirichlet process is essentially the only tractable choice for the prior. In this paper we fill this gap by considering the Pitman-Yor process with an atom in its base measure. We derive computable expressions for the distribution of the induced random partitions and for the predictive distributions. These findings allow us to devise an effective generalized Polya urn Gibbs sampler. Applications to density estimation, clustering and curve estimation, with both simulated and real data, serve as an illustration of our results and allow comparisons with existing methodology. In particular, we tackle a functional data analysis problem concerning basal body temperature curves.</p>"

<p>Early prediction of the final size of any epidemic and in particular for Zika disease outbreaks can be useful for health authorities in order to plan the response to the outbreak. The Richards model is often been used to estimate epidemiological parameters for arboviral diseases based on the reported cumulative cases in single-and multi-wave outbreaks. However, other non-linear models can also fit the data as well. Typically, one follows the so called post selection estimation procedure, i.e., selects the best fitting model out of the set of candidate models and ignores the model uncertainty in both estimation and inference since these procedures are based on a single model. In this paper we focus on the estimation of the final size and the turning point of the epidemic and conduct a real-time prediction for the final size of the outbreak using several nonlinear models in which these parameters are estimated via model averaging. The proposed method is applied to Zika outbreak data in four cities from Colombia, during the outbreak ocurred in 2015-2016.</p>"

The Kuba Kingdom, established in Central Africa in the early 17th century by King Shyaam, had more developed state institutions than the other independent villages and chieftaincies in the region. It had an unwritten constitution, separation of political powers, a judicial system with courts and juries, a police force, a military, taxation, and significant public goods provision. Comparing individuals from the Kuba Kingdom to those from just outside the Kingdom, we find that centralized formal institutions are associated with weaker norms of rule following and a greater propensity to cheat for material gain. This finding is consistent with recent models where endogenous investments to inculcate values in children decline when there is an increase in the effectiveness of formal institutions that enforce socially desirable behavior. Consistent with such a mechanism, we find that Kuba parents believe it is less important to teach children values related to rule-following behaviors.</p>"

<p>Employing a wide range of individual-level surveys, we study, the extent of cultural and institutional heterogeneity within the European Union and how this changed between 1980 and 2009. We present several novel empirical regularities that paint a complex picture. Although Europe has experienced both systematic economic convergence and an increased coordination across national and subnational business cycles since 1980, this has not been accompanied by cultural or institutional convergence. Such persistent heterogeneity does not necessarily spell doom for further political integration, however. Compared with observed heterogeneity within EU member states themselves, or in well-functioning federations such as the United States, cultural diversity across EU members is of a similar order of magnitude. The main stumbling block on the road to further political integration may not be heterogeneity in fundamental cultural traits, but other cleavages, such as national identities.</p>"

<p>Means-tested retirement benefits create incentives to cash out pension wealth. Individuals trade off the advantages from annuitization, receiving longevity risk insurance, to the disadvantages, giving up 'free' wealth in the form of means-tested supplemental income. We quantify the impact of means-tested benefits with a calibrated life-cycle model, demonstrating that they substantially reduce the desire to annuitize especially for low and intermediate levels of pension wealth. Using an administrative dataset on pension choices, we show that the model's predicted fraction of retirees choosing the annuity is able to match the annuitization pattern of occupational pension wealth observed in Switzerland. On the base of our model, we also assess alternative policies such as mandatory annutization and tougher asset tests.</p>"

Apps branded independently attracted more users and obtained stronger brand image if offered at a price. These outcomes significantly add to existing knowledge about branded apps and demonstrate that longstanding marketing laws support the understanding and evaluation of market trends in the mobile-digital context.

<p>AimThis study examined the outputs of research papers in diabetes from 31 European countries between 2002 and 2013, and their funding.</p>
<p>MethodsDiabetes research papers in the Web of Science were identified by means of a filter based on journals and title words. For 2009-2013 papers, the funders were coded to show their sector and nationality.</p>
<p>ResultsEurope published 40 547 diabetes papers in the 12 years between 2002 and 2013. Denmark, Sweden and Finland published the most relative to their wealth, but the UK published the most absolutely despite an apparently low burden (as measured by disability-adjusted life years). The largest source of funding was government (30%), followed by the non-profit sector (18%) and industry (13%). The European Commission supported 2.7% of papers, but more in Latvia (33%) and Estonia (16%). Based on an estimated cost per paper of Euro260 000, the annual research expenditure in Europe was approximately Euro986 million in 2013.</p>
<p>ConclusionsThe European diabetes burden in disability-adjusted life years increased by one third between 2002 and 2012, but its output of research papers has decreased from 44% to 36% of the world total. This decrease needs to be reviewed in the context of European non-communicable disease research policy.</p>"

<p>Background Economic insecurity correlates with adverse health outcomes, but the biological pathways involved are not well understood. We examine how changes in economic insecurity relate to metabolic, inflammatory and liver function biomarkers.</p>
<p>Methods Blood analyte data were taken from 6520 individuals (aged 25-59 years) participating in Understanding Society. Economic insecurity was measured using an indicator of subjective financial strain and by asking participants whether they had missed any bill, council tax, rent or mortgage payments in the past year. We investigated longitudinal changes in economic insecurity (remained secure, increase in economic insecurity, decrease in economic insecurity, remained insecure) and the accumulation of economic insecurity. Linear regression models were calculated for nine (logged) biomarker outcomes related to metabolic, inflammatory, liver and kidney function (as falsification tests), adjusting for potential confounders.</p>
<p>Results Compared with those who remained economically stable, people who experienced consistent economic insecurity (using both measures) had worsened levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, C reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen and glycated haemoglobin. Increased economic insecurity was associated with adverse levels of HDL-cholesterol (0.955, 95% CI 0.929 to 0.982), triglycerides (1.077, 95% CI 1.018 to 1.139) and CRP (1.114, 95% CI 1.012 to 1.227), using the measure of financial strain. Results for the other measure were generally consistent, apart from the higher levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase observed among those experiencing persistent insecurity (1.200, 95% CI 1.110 to 1.297).</p>
<p>Conclusion Economic insecurity is associated with adverse metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers (particularly HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and CRP), heightening risk for a range of health conditions.</p>"

<p>We ask which migration policy a developed country will choose when its objective is to attain the optimal skill composition of the country's workforce, and when the policy menu consists of an entry fee and a quota. We compare these two policies under the assumptions that individuals are heterogeneous in their skill level as well as in their skill type, and that individuals of one skill type, say ""scientists,"" confer a positive externality on overall productivity whereas individuals of the other skill type, say ""managers,"" do not confer such an externality. We-find that a uniform entry fee encourages self-selection such that the migrants are only or mostly highly skilled managers. The (near) absence of migrant scientists has a negative effect on the productivity of the country's workforce. Under a quota: the migrants are (a) only averagely skilled managers if the productivity externality generated by the scientists is weak, or (b) only averagely skilled scientists if the productivity externality generated by the scientists is strong. In (a), a uniform entry fee is preferable to a quota. In (b), a quota is preferable to a uniform entry fee. If, however, the entry fee for scientists is sufficiently below the entry fee for managers, then migrants will be only or mostly highly skilled scientists, rendering a differentiated entry fee preferable to a quota even when the productivity externality is strong. Instituting a differentiated fee comes, though, at a cost: the fee revenue is not as high as it will be when migrants are only or mostly managers. We conclude that if maximizing the revenue from the entry fee is not the primary objective of the developed country, then a differentiated entry fee is the preferred policy.</p>"

<p>Background The persistent circulation of measles in both low-income and high-income countries requires a better characterisation of present epidemiological trends and existing immunity gaps across different sociodemographic settings. Serological surveys, which provide direct measures of population protection against the infection, are underexploited and often supply fragmentary estimates of population immunity. This study aims to investigate how measles immunity has changed over time across different socioeconomic settings, as a result of demographic changes and past immunisation policies.</p>
<p>Methods For this multi-country modelling analysis, we developed a transmission model to simulate measles circulation during the past 65 years in nine countries with distinct demographic and vaccination histories. The model was calibrated on historical serological data and used to estimate the reduction of disease burden as a result of vaccination and present age-specific residual susceptibility.</p>
<p>Findings Our model shows that estimated residual susceptibility to measles ranges from 3% in the UK to more than 10% in Kenya and Ethiopia. In high-income countries, such as Italy, Singapore, and South Korea, where routine first-dose administration produced more than 90% of immunised individuals, only about 20% of susceptible individuals are younger than 5 years. We also observed that the reduction in fertility that has occurred during the past decades in high-income countries has contributed to almost half of the reduction in measles incidence. In low-income countries, where fertility is high, the population is younger and routine vaccination has been suboptimum. Susceptible individuals are concentrated in early childhood, with about 60% of susceptible individuals in Ethiopia younger than 10 years. In these countries, Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) were responsible for more than 25% of immunised individuals (up to 45% in Ethiopia), mitigating the consequences of suboptimum routine vaccination coverage.</p>
<p>Interpretation Future vaccination strategies in high-fertility countries should focus on increasing childhood immunisation rates, either by raising first-dose coverage or by making erratic SIAs more frequent and regular. Immunisation campaigns targeting adolescents and adults are required in low-fertility countries, where the susceptibility in these age groups will otherwise sustain measles circulation.</p>

<p>Marketing actions must create value for two key stakeholders: customers and investors. Nevertheless, these two stakeholders differ in their evaluations of firm actions in critical ways. As a result, most managers believe that there is a critical trade-off between serving customers and shareholders. Drawing upon the marketing-finance interface, the authors investigate how this trade-off unfolds to impact customer satisfaction and firm value in the context of innovation. Specifically, the present study demonstrates that creating value for customers and shareholders are not two completely distinct goals, as the business press and managers fear; innovation can create value for shareholders by satisfying customers. However, results also indicate that a crucial trade-off between satisfying consumers and creating value for investors is indeed present, as those same factors (i.e., firm's branding strategy and level of market dominance, industry-level competitive intensity) that enhance the effects of innovation on customer satisfaction depress the effects of innovation on firm value, and vice versa. The authors discuss the implications of these important findings for research and practice.</p>"

<p>We compare single round vs. runoff elections under plurality rule, allowing for partly endogenous party formation. With large and sufficiently polarized groups of moderate voters, under runoff elections, the number of political candidates is larger, but the influence of extremist voters on equilibrium policy and hence policy volatility is smaller, because the bargaining power of the political extremes is reduced compared to single round elections.

<p>Waiting times are a major policy concern in publicly funded health systems across OECD countries. Economists have argued that, in the presence of excess demand, waiting times act as nonmonetary prices to bring demand for and supply of health care in equilibrium. Using administrative data disaggregated by region and surgical procedure over 2010-2014 in Italy, we estimate demand and supply elasticities with respect to waiting times. We employ linear regression models with first differences and instrumental variables to deal with endogeneity of waiting times. We find that demand is inelastic to waiting times while supply is more elastic. Estimates of demand elasticity are between -0.15 to -0.24. Our results have implications on the effectiveness of policies aimed at increasing supply and their ability to reduce waiting times.</p>"

We find evidence of the diaspora effect for the Asian but not the European countries, with the exception of Russia. A diaspora effect does not necessarily translate into a brain gain effect, most notably for India where no such effect is detected. Neither does a brain gain effect occur solely in conjunction with a diaspora effect. Overall, diaspora and brain gain effects carry less weight than other channels of knowledge transmission, most notably co-invention networks and multinational companies.</p>"

We find no effect for girls, whose inheritance was de facto unaffected. These patterns suggest that before the reform matrilineal groups invested more in education than they would if unconstrained, to substitute for land inheritance, underscoring the importance of cultural norms.</p>"

<p>Background: The current literature on the enabling conditions of multidisciplinary teams focuses on the singular dimensions of the organizations (i.e., human resources, clinical pathways, objects) without shedding light on to the way in which these organizational factors interact and mutually influence one another.</p>
<p>Purpose: Drawing on a system perspective of organizations, the authors analyze the organizational patterns that promote and support multidisciplinary teams and how they interrelate and interact to enforce the organization work system.</p>
<p>Methodology/Approach: The authors develop a modified sociotechnical system (STS) model to understand how the two dimensions of technical (devices/tools, layout/organization of space, core process standardization) and social (organizational structure, management of human resources and operations) can facilitate the implementation of multidisciplinary teams in health care. The study conducts an empirical analysis based on a sample of hospital adopters of transcatheter aortic valve implantation using the revised STS model.</p>
<p>Findings: The modified STS model applied to the case studies improves our understanding of the critical implementation factors of a multidisciplinary approach and the importance of coordinating radical changes in the technical and the social subsystems of health care organizations. The analysis informs that the multidisciplinary effort is not a sequential process and that the interplay between the two subsystems needs to be managed efficaciously as an integrated organizational whole to deliver the goals set.</p>
<p>Practice Implications: Hospital managers must place equal focus on the closely interrelated technical and social dimensions by investing in (a) shared layouts and spaces that cross the boundaries of the specialized health care units, (b) standardization of the core processes through the implementation of local clinical pathways, (c) structured knowledge management mechanisms, (d) the creation of clinical directorates, and (e) the design of a planning and budgeting system that integrates the multidisciplinary concept.</p>"

<p>In this paper we analyse the electricity consumption of a set of four traditional 'white goods' in a panel of ten EU countries observed over the period 1995-2013 with the aim of disentangling the amount of technical efficiency from overall energy saving using a stochastic frontier approach. The efficiency trend is modelled as a function of energy efficiency policies and innovation dynamics that combines invention and adoption processes using specific patents weighted by granular production data and worldwide bilateral import flows. Our model also accounts for potential endogeneity arising when innovation processes and economic growth are considered. With this replicable approach, the stochastic frontier framework allows for explicit modelling of innovation processes. Our results show that the efficiency component is related to changes in the energy efficient technological content of appliances. The 'international' component represents a predominant share of technological advancement and exerts a significant influence on the transient efficiency. Our evidence calls for an active role to be played by policy makers in focusing on innovation and trade policies in order to achieve more ambitious energy efficiency targets. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

<p>This paper analyses the potential of distributed storage to mitigate impacts of embedded PV generation on the distribution grid by improving local balance between generation and demand, thereby enabling higher levels of PV penetration. In particular it looks at the potential of storage to: 1. reduce impacts on power flows due to local supply and demand imbalances driven by PV deployment within the UK domestic and non-domestic markets; 2. of improving PV capacity credit, i.e. the contribution of installed PV to meeting electricity demand within the UK electricity system. Results highlight how, under current levels of deployment, PV generation does not create major problems for the local distribution network, but that storage might play a relevant role for higher levels of PV deployment across the UK. The paper contribute to academic debate in the field by providing a novel locally disaggregated framework for the analysis of embedded PV generation integration into the distribution grid. It also provides a useful tool for network operators, regulators and policy makers.</p>"

<p>BACKGROUNDWe assessed the economic impact of the invasive pest Drosophilasuzukii (Matsumura) on the soft fruit industry (strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and blueberries) in Trentino, Northern Italy, using cost-benefit analysis. A conventional integrated pest management (IPM) based on insecticide, mass trapping and cultural measures is compared with an upgraded IPM strategy based on exclusion netting. Costs and benefits associated with the change between the two are estimated to evaluate the most profitable strategy from a societal point of view. The robustness of the results to uncertainty in parameter values is assessed through probabilistic sensitivity analysis.</p>
<p>RESULTSIn a period of low pest pressure, the conventional IPM strategy would likely be more profitable than no management. However, with higher pest pressure levels, the upgraded IPM strategy would increasingly be more profitable than conventional IPM as pest damage levels increase.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONFor the problem considered in this study, insecticide-based management is expected to prove less and less profitable as rising pest pressure levels lead to an intensification of the insecticide applications. Conversely, exclusion netting, despite being more expensive, is expected to be much more profitable, in terms of both its effectiveness in reducing pest pressure and its lower societal impact.

<p>The link between material resource adequacy and the performance of innovation projects is one of the most basic and managerially rewarding relationships in innovation management to study, and yet it has remained unclear. Some argue that adequate material resources foster innovation, whereas others suggest the exact opposite: constrained material resources stimulate creativity and innovation. Complementing previous work that focused on project-level contingencies of the relationship between material resource adequacy and innovation project performance, the objective of this meta-analysis is to develop a contingency framework involving study-level and context-level boundary conditions in an attempt to clarify this relationship. The results show that material resource adequacy is basically positively related to innovation project performance. Testing whether the focus on different dimensions of innovation project performance alters this basic relationship results in the same positive relationship for all examined innovation project outcomes (i.e., general performance, project efficiency, product quality, speed, and market success), except new-product novelty that did not show a significant relationship with material resource adequacy. Moreover, while the relationship between material resource adequacy and innovation project outcomes turns out to be generalizable across different types of material resources (financial resources vs. equipment) and different product types (tangible vs. intangible products), it is contingent upon the national culture of the countries, in which the projects have been carried out. Specifically, studies in countries scoring high on the cultural dimension of power distance show significantly stronger positive correlations between adequacy of material resources and innovation project performance. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.</p>"

<p>Purpose: To identify hypoxia-related biomarkers indicative of response and resistance to epirubicin treatment in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.</p>
<p>Patients and Methods: One hundred seventy-six women with T2-4 N0-1 breast tumours were randomly assigned to receive epirubicin 120 mg/m2/1-21 (EPI ARM), epirubicin 120 mg/m2/1-21 + erythropoietin 10.000 IU sc three times weekly (EPIEPO ARM) and epirubicin 40 mg/m2/w-q21 (EPI-W ARM). Sixteen tumour proteins involved in cell survival, hypoxia, angiogenesis and growth factor, were assessed by immunohistochemistry in pre-treatment samples. A multivariate generalized linear regression approach was applied using a penalized least-square minimization to perform variable selection and regularization.</p>
<p>Results: VEGF and GLUT-1 expression were significantly positively associated with complete response (CR) to treatment in all leave-one-out iterations. Bcl-2 expression was inversely correlated with pCR, whilst EPO expression was positively correlated with pathological complete response (pCR). Haemaglobin and HIF-1a nuclear expression were inversely correlated with pCR. HB and HIF-1a expression were associated with a higher risk of relapse and overall survival.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Hypoxic biomarkers determines the epirubicin resistance in breast cancer. Assessment of such biomarkers, may be useful for predicting chemosensitivity and also anthracycline-based treatment outcome.</p>"

<p>Food security and food waste are unanimously recognised as relevant issues affecting the whole society and should be therefore acknowledged as a priority on the public agenda. Nonetheless, in many countries the third sector stands in for public actors and operates to tackle both these issues. This paper explores the role of public and third sector in tackling food poverty and food waste, particularly analysing the role of the non-profit organisations involved in the food recovery and redistribution processes in two European regions: Lombardy (Italy) and Baden-Wurttemberg (Germany). By comparing the two different policy framework and the organisations' actions, the study recognises the ability of the non-profit sector to create new relationships among different actors (private for-profit, private non-profit as well as public actors) while answering various unmet needs. The paper draws on a mix of secondary and primary data including observations and interviews in the two regions carried out in 2014 and focuses on two relevant case studies (the ""Associazione Banco Alimentare"" and the ""Tafel"").</p>"

<p>In the last decades, several European countries where arboviral infections are not endemic have faced outbreaks of diseases such as chikungunya and dengue, initially introduced by infectious travellers from tropical endemic areas and then spread locally via mosquito bites. To keep in check the epidemiological risk, interventions targeted to control vector abundance can be implemented by local authorities. We assessed the epidemiological effectiveness and economic costs and benefits of routine larviciding in European towns with temperate climate, using a mathematical model of Aedes albopictus populations and viral transmission, calibrated on entomological surveillance data collected from ten municipalities in Northern Italy during 2014 and 2015. We found that routine larviciding of public catch basins can limit both the risk of autochthonous transmission and the size of potential epidemics. Ideal larvicide interventions should be timed in such a way to cover the month of July. Optimally timed larviciding can reduce locally transmitted cases of chikungunya by 20% - 33% for a single application (dengue: 18-22%) and up to 43% - 65% if treatment is repeated four times throughout the season (dengue: 31-51%). In larger municipalities (> 35,000 inhabitants), the cost of comprehensive larviciding over the whole urban area overcomes potential health benefits related to preventing cases of disease, suggesting the adoption of more localized interventions. Small/medium sized towns with high mosquito abundance will likely have a positive cost-benefit balance. Involvement of private citizens in routine larviciding activities further reduces transmission risks but with disproportionate costs of intervention. International travels and the incidence of mosquito-borne diseases are increasing worldwide, exposing a growing number of European citizens to higher risks of potential outbreaks. Results from this study may support the planning and timing of interventions aimed to reduce the probability of autochthonous transmission as well as the nuisance for local populations living in temperate areas of Europe.</p>"

<p>Background: Evidence shows that territorial borders continue to have an impact on research collaboration in Europe. Knowledge of national research structural contexts is therefore crucial to the promotion of Europe-wide policies for research funding. Nevertheless, studies assessing and comparing research systems remain scarce. This paper aims to further the knowledge on national research landscapes in Europe, focusing on non-communicable disease (NCD) research in Italy and Germany.</p>
<p>Methods: To capture the architecture of country-specific research funding systems, a three-fold strategy was adopted. First, a literature review was conducted to determine a list of key public, voluntary/ private non-profit and commercial research funding organisations (RFOs). Second, an electronic survey was administered qualifying RFOs. Finally, survey results were integrated with semi-structured interviews with key opinion leaders in NCD research. Three major dimensions of interest were investigated-funding mechanisms, funding patterns and expectations regarding outputs.</p>
<p>Results: The number of RFOs in Italy is four times larger than that in Germany and the Italian research system has more project funding instruments than the German system. Regarding the funding patterns towards NCD areas, in both countries, respiratory disease research resulted as the lowest funded, whereas cancer research was the target of most funding streams. The most reported expected outputs of funded research activity were scholarly publication of articles and reports.</p>
<p>Conclusions: This cross-country comparison on the Italian and German research funding structures revealed substantial differences between the two systems. The current system is prone to duplicated research efforts, popular funding for some diseases and intransparency of research results. Future research will require addressing the need for better coordination of research funding efforts, even more so if European research efforts are to play a greater role.</p>"

We evaluate the severity of this robustness problem by characterizing conditions on the primitives of the model-the players' beliefs and higher-order beliefs about the payoff-relevant parameters-for the behaviour of a given Harsanyi type to be approximated by the behaviour of (a sequence of) perturbed types. This amounts to providing belief-based characterizations of the strategic topologies of Dekel et al. (2006). We apply our characterizations to a variety of questions concerning robustness to perturbations of higher-order beliefs, including genericity of types that are consistent with a common prior, and we investigate the connections between our notions of robustness and the notion of common p-belief of Monderer and Samet (1989).</p>"

<p>Risk-informed decision making is often accompanied by the specification of an acceptable level of risk. Such target level is compared against the value of a risk metric, usually computed through a probabilistic safety assessment model, to decide about the acceptability of a given design, the launch of a space mission, etc. Importance measures complement the decision process with information about the risk/safety significance of events. However, importance measures do not tell us whether the occurrence of an event can change the overarching decision. By linking value of information and importance measures for probabilistic risk assessment models, this work obtains a value-of-information-based importance measure that brings together the risk metric, risk importance measures, and the risk threshold in one expression. The new importance measure does not impose additional computational burden because it can be calculated from our knowledge of the risk achievement and risk reduction worth, and complements the insights delivered by these importance measures. Several properties are discussed, including the joint decision worth of basic event groups. The application to the large loss of coolant accident sequence of the Advanced Test Reactor helps us in illustrating the risk analysis insights.</p>"

Consistent with recent research conducted on other European areas, during the early modern period we find clear indications of a tendency for economic inequality to grow continually, a finding that for Tuscany cannot be explained as the consequence of economic growth. Furthermore, the exceptionally old sources we use allow us to demonstrate that a phase of declining inequality, lasting about one century, was triggered by the Black Death from 1348 to 1349.

We assess if, and to what extent, trust and the values of obedience and respect influence Europeans' satisfaction of these needs, controlling for income and education. We find a positive and significant impact for generalized morality (high trust and respect, low obedience), which is robust to different checks for endogeneity, including instrumental variable regressions at country, regional and individual level. Results suggest that lack of trust, high obedience and low respect not only reduce the wealth of nations, but also constrain the satisfaction of basic psychological needs, thereby hindering the individuals' fulfilment of happiness.

<p>In this paper we theorize about illicit roles and explore their effects on resilient team performance. We define an illicit role as one whose occupants specialize in activity forbidden by the law, regulatory bodies, or professional societies, in the belief that doing so provides a competitive advantage. Using longitudinal data on professional hockey teams, we examine the enforcer-a player who specializes in the prohibited activity of fighting. We find that team performance is more disrupted by the injury of an enforcer than by the injury of occupants of other formal roles on the team. In addition, team performance recovers more slowly after this setback to the extent the team tries to replace an enforcer, and the performance disruptions associated with his exit are magnified as a function of his experience with his team. We use these findings to develop new theory about organizational roles that operate outside official channels and formal structures. We suggest that such role occupants are more difficult to replace than their formal counterparts, in part because to enact these roles effectively requires experience in the local social context.</p>"

<p>Resource allocation in firms is often done in relative terms. Allocations to each project or, in the case of multibusiness firms, business segments are not made independently but through comparisons among the options. In that context, it becomes particularly important to identify the organizational factors that might influence those processes, as well as the mechanisms that create that influence. In this article, we investigate one of those potential factorsthe size of a business segment relative to the rest of the organizationand two possible accounts. One is a naive tendency to spread out allocations evenly over the firm's segments that would cause managers to relatively ignore differences in size and favor smaller segments over larger ones, holding other variables constant. The second is a tendency to direct larger allocation to the segments with the most political power and clout within the organization, which would normally favor larger segments, as those generally possess more influence. We investigate these competing hypotheses in a cross-section of firms to conclude that both mechanisms are partially at play. We find that both the smallest and the largest of segments are favored in the capital allocation process. Moreover, we find that the segment's growth and profitability as well as corporate management ownership of the company moderate those effects.</p>"

<p>We investigate how leadership by couples affects the profitability of family firms. Using comprehensive data from Italy, we show that family firms led by married couples perform significantly better than other family firms. This result is robust to several estimation techniques, including matching, instrumental variables and transition analyses. Marital leadership works best when firm operations are complex and knowledge-based, as well as when the firm is subject to agency conflicts due to weak competition and poor legal infrastructure. Studying the mechanisms behind these results, we show that the presence of couples at the top of the firm enhances the willingness to invest during uncertain times, reduces employee turnover, and improves labor productivity.

<p>Business models change as managers not only innovate business models, but also engage in more mundane adaptation in response to external changes, such as changes in the level or composition of demand. However, little is known about what causes such business model adaptation. We employ threat-rigidity as well as prospect theory to examine business model adaptation in response to external threats and opportunities. Additionally, drawing on the behavioural theory of the firm, we argue that the past strategic orientation of a firm creates path dependencies that influence the propensity of the firm to adapt its business model. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 1196 Norwegian companies, and find that firms are more likely to adapt their business model under conditions of perceived threats than opportunities, and that strategic orientation geared towards market development is more conducive to business model adaptation than an orientation geared towards defending an existing market position.

<p>In 2008, the European Commission (EC) launched the Covenant of Mayors (CoM), a voluntary agreement under which local governments commit to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 20% within 2020, in order to reinforce local authorities in designing strategies to mitigate climate change in coherence with the European Union's climate policy. The CoM may be defined as a coordinated collection of experiments based on common rules established by the EC. Cities signing the CoM commit to follow guidelines and standardized methodologies in setting CO2 emission reduction targets and in designing and implementing policies and measures to reach them, through the definition of key tools such as the Baseline Emission Inventory (BEI) and the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP). The present study analyses the emission reduction strategies of a sample of 124 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, signatories of the CoM, which delivered a SEAP by February 2014. More than 5500 actions planned by the sample cities were analysed and categorized. The most relevant actions in terms of recurrence and mitigation impact were assessed. Finally a set of variables was tested through a regression so as to determine their influence on emission reductions strategies.</p>
<p>The main results of this study show that the sample cities accounted for a total of 370 million tons of CO2 emissions in selected baseline years and 94 million tons of intended emission reductions per year. The total emission reductions planned by cities reached 25% of the baseline emissions. Buildings and Transport stood out as the sectors where cities intend to deliver the largest emission reductions. Furthermore the analysis showed that cities' administrations attribute higher potential to actions in subsectors under their direct control (municipal buildings, public transport, municipal fleet and public lighting) compared to actions in subsectors managed by private actors (households and firms). In the Building sector, the category of action delivering the highest share of CO2 emission reductions was represented by integrated actions, which combine several types of intervention so as to maximise the energy efficiency of buildings. In the transport sector, it was the modal shift, which implies a transition from private transport to public and cleaner transport modes. In both the Building and Transport sectors, cities plan to reduce the major amount of CO2 emissions through the implementation of management and organization, infrastructure construction and awareness-raising policy levers.</p>
<p>Our results may be useful to urban policy makers to shape their mitigation strategies in coherence with cities' commitments and plans and to replicate policies and actions on the basis of CoM signatories' experiences. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>In this work, we investigate methods for gaining greater insight from hydrological model runs conducted for uncertainty quantification and model differentiation. We frame the sensitivity analysis questions in terms of the main purposes of sensitivity analysis: parameter prioritization, trend identification, and interaction quantification. For parameter prioritization, we consider variance-based sensitivity measures, sensitivity indices based on the L-1-norm, the Kuiper metric, and the sensitivity indices of the DELSA methods. For trend identification, we investigate insights derived from graphing the one-way ANOVA sensitivity functions, the recently introduced CUSUNORO plots, and derivative scatterplots. For interaction quantification, we consider information delivered by variance-based sensitivity indices. We rely on the so-called given-data principle, in which results from a set of model runs are used to perform a defined set of analyses. One avoids using specific designs for each insight, thus controlling the computational burden. The methodology is applied to a hydrological model of a river in Belgium simulated using the well-established Framework for Understanding Structural Errors (FUSE) on five alternative configurations. The findings show that the integration of the chosen methods provides insights unavailable in most other analyses.</p>"

<p>The aim of this paper is to analyze the factors determining the choice of energy policy setting in favor of renewable energy sources. We investigate if such determinants are different between countries at different stage of development. Finally, we study if the adoption of green energy policies is characterized by complementary or substitution effects. Our analysis aims at responding at two research questions: what are the factors influencing a country's choice for a specific type of energy policy? Is it possible to identify either complementary or substitute policy interventions based on a country's level of economic development? Moreover, are developing systematically different from developed countries in manage public and private resources for renewable energies? The empirical analysis employs a panel probit model estimated over a sample of 56 countries observed between 2004 and 2011. The results show that while context variables have the same impact in developed and developing countries, public operational variables play a different role. Governments in richer countries are bound to play only a role of an arbiter. On the contrary, governments of developing countries are more directly involved in the management of energy policies. Hence, a greater impact is recognized to policies with direct involvement of the government. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Positive and negative views of family firms and their performance abound. Although there have been explanations for this divergence based on conditions of governance and context, the institutional environment has been less thoroughly explored as a source of these differences. We argue that the blend of family and market institutional logics in the regional communities where firms operate can have an important impact on the governance arrangements and financial performance of family firms. Specifically, we find that family-intensive governance is more common where family logic predominates in a region, and does best when this logic remains at modest levels or is countered by market logic. We test and support these notions in a comprehensive sample of private family firms in Italy, an ideal context in which distinct historically-determined logics exists among its 20 regions.

<p>Voluntary policy compliance is an important yet rarely studied topic in public administration. To address the paucity of research, this article proposes and empirically tests a conceptual framework that ties policy transparency and policy understanding to voluntary policy compliance intentions. The reasoning is that the extent to which citizens understand a policy contributes to their intentions to comply with that policy. Further, the authors argue that policy transparency indirectly influences voluntary policy compliance intentions through a positive effect on citizens' levels of policy understanding. To enhance the validity of the findings, the authors assess these relationships across two policy domains. The findings reflect an indirect positive effect of transparency on voluntary compliance occurring through policy understanding. However, this emerged only for one policy domain. These results suggest that the effects of policy transparency on policy understanding and voluntary policy compliance intentions may depend on the policy domain.</p>"

<p>We study linear quadratic games played on a network. Agents face peer effects with distance-one neighbors, and strategic substitution with distance-two neighbors (local congestion). For this class of games, we show that an interior equilibrium exists both in the high and in the low regions of the largest eigenvalue, but may not exist in the intermediate region. In the low region, equilibrium is proportional to a weighted version of Bonacich centrality, where weights are themselves centrality measures for the network. Local congestion has the effect of decreasing equilibrium behavior, potentially affecting the ranking of equilibrium actions. When strategic interaction extends beyond distance-two, equilibrium is characterized by a ""nested"" Bonacich centrality measure, and existence properties depend on the sign of strategic interaction at the furthest distance. We support the assumption of local congestion by presenting empirical evidence from a secondary school Dutch dataset. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>Patent holders may choose to protect innovations with single patents or to develop portfolios of multiple, related patents. We propose a decision-making model in which patent holders allocate resources to either expanding the number of related patents or investing in higher value of patents in the portfolio. We estimate the derived value equation using portfolio value data from an inventor survey at the level of individual inventions rather than the firm as a whole. We find that investments in individual inventions exhibit diminishing returns, and that a good part of the value of a portfolio depends on adding new patented inventions. Also, while diminishing returns to individual inventions are stable across subsamples, the returns to portfolio size vary between complex and discrete industries, and between inventions that are science-based or driven by customer information. When firms seek to strengthen appropriability, the returns to an increase of portfolio size are not different from the sample average. Thus, a higher number of inventions in a portfolio may reflect both stronger appropriability via patents and genuine creation of value.</p>"

<p>The process of leaving the European Union (EU) will have profound consequences for health and the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. In this paper, we use the WHO health system building blocks framework to assess the likely effects of three scenarios we term soft Brexit, hard Brexit, and failed Brexit. We conclude that each scenario poses substantial threats. The workforce of the NHS is heavily reliant on EU staff. Financing of health care for UK citizens in the EU and vice versa is threatened, as is access to some capital funds, while Brexit threatens overall economic performance. Access to pharmaceuticals, technology, blood, and organs for transplant is jeopardised. Information used for international comparisons is threatened, as is service delivery, especially in Northern Ireland. Governance concerns relate to public health, competition and trade law, and research. However, we identified a few potential opportunities for improvement in areas such as competition law and flexibility of training, should the UK Government take them. Overall, a soft version of Brexit would minimise health threats whereas failed Brexit would be the riskiest outcome. Effective parliamentary scrutiny of policy and legal changes will be essential, but the scale of the task risks overwhelming parliament and the civil service.</p>"

<p>Research summary: In this article, we study how a firm's stakeholder orientation affects the performance of its corporate acquisitions. We depart from prior literature and suggest that orientations toward employees, customers, suppliers, and local communities will affect long-term acquisition performance both directly and through its interactions with process characteristics, such as preacquisition relatedness and postacquisition integration. Analyses of data on a sample of 1884 acquisitions show overall a positive association between acquirers' stakeholder orientation and acquisition performance. In addition, we find support for a positive moderation of business relatedness on the performance impacts of stakeholder orientation. Structural integration has a similarly positive moderation effect only for some of the stakeholder categories.Managerial summary: Does collaboration with stakeholders during an acquisition pay off in terms of performance? The results of this research show that it is worth engaging stakeholders during the M&A process, but that the efficacy of involvement practices may depend on the type of stakeholders and the characteristics of the acquisition. While acquiring firms that take account of suppliers and local communities consistently overperform in their acquisitions, the inclusion of employees might be not beneficial (and even harmful) when the target firm operates in a dissimilar business or when managers do not plan to maintain it as a separate entity.

<p>In this paper, we explore whether individuals who strive to self-verify flourish or flounder on the job market. Using placement data from 2 very different field samples, we found that individuals rated by the organization as being in the top 10% of candidates were significantly more likely to receive a job offer if they have a stronger drive to self-verify. A third study, using a quasi-experimental design, explored the mechanism behind this effect and tested whether individuals who are high and low on this disposition communicate differently in a structured mock job interview. Text analysis ( LIWC) of interview transcripts revealed systematic differences in candidates' language use as a function of their self-verification drives. These differences led an expert rater to perceive candidates with a strong drive to self-verify as less inauthentic and less misrepresentative than their low self-verifying peers, making her more likely to recommend these candidates for a job. Taken together, our results suggest that authentic self-presentation is an unidentified route to success on the job market, amplifying the chances that high-quality candidates can convert organizations' positive evaluations into tangible job offers. We discuss implications for job applicants, organizations, and the labor market.</p>"

<p>Methods: I analyzed individual-level data about victims (n = 488,829) of fatal traffic accidents that occurred in the US between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2015 from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System of the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration.</p>
<p>Results: There is a strong relationship between alcohol consumption and restraint use. Both vehicle drivers and occupants are far less likely to be restrained when inebriated. Additional analyses show that part of the effect of alcohol consumption on traffic fatalities can be attributed to restraint omission.</p>
<p>Conclusions: There is a significant relationship between alcohol consumption and restraint omission for both drivers and occupants of vehicles that were involved in fatal traffic accidents in the US between January 1999 and December 2015. Past public health campaigns have focused on preventing traffic fatalities by persuading drivers to refrain from getting behind the wheel after consuming alcohol. My data suggest that public health campaigns should inform both drivers and occupants of vehicles about the relationship between alcohol and restraint omission in order to minimize future casualties.</p>"

<p>Introduction: To assess the role of the tumour response rate (RR) after immune checkpoint inhibitors-based therapy as a potential surrogate end-point of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with solid tumours, we performed a trial-based meta-regression of randomised studies comparing different immune checkpoint inhibitors-based treatments.</p>
<p>Methods: The systematic literature search included the electronic databases and the proceedings of oncologic meetings. Treatment effects on PFS and OS were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs); treatment effects on RR were expressed as odds ratios (ORs). A weighted regression analysis was performed on log-transformed treatment effect estimates to test the association between treatment effects on the surrogate outcome and treatment effects on the clinical outcome.</p>
<p>Results: Twenty-four trials, for a total of 11,894 patients, were included in the analysis. Using the complete set of data, the regression of either the log(HR) for PFS or the log(HR) for OS on the log(OR) for RR demonstrated weak associations (R-2 = 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.77; P = 0.001; and R-2 = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.02-0.76; P = 0.01, respectively). The pre-planned analyses stratifying trials according to different type of disease and different mechanism of action of immune checkpoint inhibitors showed a very weak association of the RR with the OS for none-small cell lung cancer indicated and a modest association of the RR with the PFS for cytotoxic T lymphocytee-associated antigen 4 checkpoint inhibitors.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The results of the trial-based meta-regression analysis indicated a weak correlation between RR and OS, supporting future investigations to assess the surrogacy of RR in the patient treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</p>"

<p>In this article, we analyse the mechanisms of agenda setting by focusing on the determinants of individual attitudes towards crime and investigating the role played by the media. After a brief literature review supporting the relevance of the selected topic of inquiry and the presentation of our analytical framework, we study the persuasion effects of mass media. More specifically, we investigate how TV exposure can shape individual perceptions of specific issues such as crime, and then focus on the effects of exposure to crime news on voting decisions. Using the Italian 2001 general election as an important case study of TV power concentration, we provide evidence that media-induced agenda setting enhanced the salience of the crime issue in voters' minds during the 2001 Italian general election and contributed to the victory of the coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi. Interestingly, our results are partially driven by the switch of previous left-wing voters to voting for the centre right because of exposure to crime news.</p>"

<p>This study introduces the concept of personal innovative behaviour and demonstrates its validity in the context of e-book reader adoption and use. Personal innovative behaviour, unlike measures of consumer innovativeness, amalgamates decisions about product adoption with reports of the product's actual use. Quantitative methodology was used, and probability proportional stratified sampling technique was used to obtain the proportionate sample. Items to measure personal innovative behaviour for e-book readers were included in a questionnaire distributed to students at a Malaysian university. Of the 386 participants, 79% used the e-book reader, half of them for academic purposes. Confirmatory factor analysis using Amos tested the concept of personal innovative behaviour for both users and non-users. The results indicated that the underlying dimensions, (intended Adoption Behaviour and actual Use Behaviour), could be measured and combined in a structural model only for users, i.e. innovators. Good model fit confirmed the validity and reliability of the framework. The redefined construct and scale validation will be helpful to researchers to measure the individual personal behaviour in terms of their final decision to adopt and actual usage of the novel product. The personal innovative behaviour scale presented here can be used by researchers and practitioners to measure adoption and use of personal information products and devices. The two dimensional conceptualization of personal innovative behaviour (intended Adoption Behaviour and actual Use Behaviour) reconciles similarities and differences between the decision and action variables in innovation diffusion theory and the technology acceptance model.</p>"

<p>The paper provides fresh empirical evidence on the adaptation process in Niger rural communities using original longitudinal socio-economic panel data merged with granular geo-referenced climatic information. We identify the main drivers and impacts of crop and labor diversification which constitute two livelihood strategies on moderating the adaptation deficit. In doing so, we account for the interdependence between the two diversification practices and potential reverse causality between welfare outcomes and diversification behavior. Moreover, we condition the impacts of diversification on different sections of the welfare distribution to capture potential non-linear effects. Our results reveal that the diversification has positive and significant welfare impacts when most vulnerable households rely on it as an adaptation strategy to mid-run climate variability and as a, coping strategy to short-run market shocks. At the same time, our results find lower but still positive impacts for well-endowed households that are likely to diversify their activity portfolio. Given the very limited presence of policy support, we conclude that the rural Nigerien communities are characterized by a large and autonomous adaptation response which constitutes a key leverage mechanism for policy makers. We thus suggest government interventions aimed at supporting the most important diversification drivers, but also aimed at straightening some channels, such as network infrastructures or the promotion of local crop varieties, which may have a greater potential in triggering diversification.

<p>This paper proposes a new, alternative analysis of patent data in order to extract knowledge patterns from inventors' collaboration networks. Indeed, moving from a basic network analysis, we provide new developments to map and study co-inventorship. The goal of this research is to provide an overall understanding of the dynamics concerning knowledge flows in inventive activities. We show how the network of inventors is, on average, increasing in size: more and more inventors are contributing to technology innovations and they are more connected to each other. We also show to what extent inventors from different countries tend to cooperate with their local peers or internationally. Furthermore, an analysis of the clustering of inventors is carried out to show differences across countries in the structure of inventors' communities, with a particular focus on the dynamics of collaboration for power inventors (i.e. star inventors).</p>"

<p>We suggest a generalized spatial system GMM (SGMM) estimation for short dynamic panel data models with spatial errors and fixed effects when n is large and T is fixed (usually small). Monte Carlo studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample properties with the quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE). The results show that, QMLE, with a proper approximation for initial observation, performs better than SGMM in general cases. However, it performs poorly when spatial dependence is large. QMLE and SGMM perform better for different parameters when there is unknown heteroscedasticity in the disturbances and the data are highly persistent. Both estimates are not sensitive to the treatment of initial values. Estimation of the spatial autoregressive parameter is generally biased when either the data are highly persistent or spatial dependence is large. Choices of spatial weights matrices and the sign of spatial dependence do affect the performance of the estimates, especially in the case of the heteroscedastic disturbance. We also give empirical guidelines for the model.</p>"

The Dirichlet form methods have the added advantage of providing an explicit construction of the underlying infinite-dimensional context. In particular, this enables us directly to establish weak convergence to the relevant infinite-dimensional distributions. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.</p>"

<p>Manuscript Type: Empirical</p>
<p>Research Question/Issue: Family firms, as insider-controlled companies, should be less likely to exhibit CEO turnover after poor performance and may thus promote enhanced focus on long-term goals. However, when a non-family CEO is in charge, the relatively limited empirical evidence is contrasting. Some studies find that only family CEOs are immune from the threat of dismissal following poor financial performance, while other studies show that family firms discipline their CEOs for poor financial performance regardless of their family status. In this work, we try to reconcile these contrasting findings and investigate what ownership and governance conditions influence the owners' pressure on the CEO to achieve short-term financial results.</p>
<p>Research findings/insights: Drawing on a longitudinal dataset that covers the entire population of Italian medium and large family companies, we find that when family ownership is concentrated in the hands of few family shareholders or there is a low number of family members involved in the board of directors, non-family CEOs are less likely to be dismissed after poor performance.</p>
<p>Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study, adopting the behavioral agency theory as the guiding framework, highlights the importance for governance decisions of the potential goal divergence among principals in closely held ownership structures. Our results also add to the still scant literature on the relationship between family owners and non-family CEOs.</p>
<p>Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our research suggests that, in the decision to hire a non-family CEO, family business owners should not only assess their gaps in managerial skills but also carefully consider the ownership structure and family involvement conditions. On the side of professional non-family managers, our results offer insights on ways to address the employment relationship with the controlling family.</p>"

The results, based on data from the motion picture industry, demonstrate that brand equity, financial resources, and competitive intensity result in shorter global product rollout and that shorter global product rollout enhances global product performance. They also find that brand equity and financial resources operate as moderators, magnifying the effect of length of global product rollout on global product performance.

<p>This paper investigates the effects of the intra-European posting of workers on domestic labour markets in the years 2007-2009. Instrumental variables related to neighbouring countries' populations are used to address the endogeneity between posting and labour market features. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that an intensification of posting inflows is not likely to displace domestic workers, at any educational levels. Instead, an increase in posting from abroad may raise domestic labour costs. No significant effects are found on sending country labour market variables. Results point towards the development of possible synergies between domestic and posted workers, so that posting can actually improve labour efficiency and put upward pressure on labour costs.</p>"

<p>Expressions of dissent by corporate directors might be a valuable attribute of good corporate governance indicating the existence of an active board, but dissent is not necessarily a sign of independence, and can be disruptive and ill-motivated. Notwithstanding the potential importance of directors' dissent, the subject has been largely neglected in the academic literature, also due to the scarcity of empirical or anecdotal evidence. We examine empirically dissent of directors-expressed either by voting against a resolution of the board, or by resigning from the board-using handpicked data from the Italian market. Differently from the few other works on this issue, we also consider dissent expressed by non-independent directors. After an overview of the existing literature on directors' dissent, we discuss the legal framework of dissent under Italian law. We then present our dataset and discuss some methodological issues. In our empirical analysis, we address four questions: (a) What are the topics that directors more often dissent on? (b) What are the characteristics of dissenting directors in terms of age, gender, education, compensation, and who appointed them, as well as in terms of the organization of the board (e.g., if the positions of President and CEO are separated)? (c) In what types of corporations is dissent more common, in particular with respect to economic performance? (d) What are the consequences of dissent in terms of cumulative abnormal returns and volatility of the shares? Based on the results of the analysis, we offer some conclusions and raise some policy questions.</p>"

<p>We develop new likelihood-based methods to estimate factor-based Stochastic Discount Factors (SDF) that may accommodate Hidden Markov dynamics in the factor loadings. We use these methods to investigate whether it is possible to find a SDF that jointly prices the cross-section of eight U.S. portfolios of stocks, Treasuries, corporate bonds, and commodities. In particular, we test a range of possible different specification of the SDF, including single-state and Hidden Markov models and compare their statistical and pricing performances. In addition, we assess whether and to which extent a selection of these models replicates the observed moments of the return series, and especially correlations. We report that regime switching models clearly outperform single-state ones both in term of statistical and pricing accuracy. However, while a four-state model is selected by the information criteria, a two-state three-factor full Vector Autoregression model outperforms the others as far as the pricing accuracy is concerned.

<p>Starting from the dynamic factor model for nonstationary data we derive the factor-augmented error correction model (FECM) and its moving-average representation. The latter is used for the identification of structural shocks and their propagation mechanisms. We show how to implement classical identification schemes based on long-run restrictions in the case of large panels. The importance of the error correction mechanism for impulse response analysis is analyzed by means of both empirical examples and simulation experiments. Our results show that the bias in estimated impulse responses in a factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) model is positively related to the strength of the error correction mechanism and the cross-section dimension of the panel. We observe empirically in a large panel of US data that these features have a substantial effect on the responses of several variables to the identified permanent real (productivity) and monetary policy shocks.</p>"

<p>AIM</p>
<p>To analyze the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with both node-negative gastric carcinoma and diagnosis of recurrence during follow-up.</p>
<p>METHODS</p>
<p>We enrolled 41 patients treated with curative gastrectomy for pT2-4aN0 gastric carcinoma between 1992 and 2010, who developed recurrence (Group 1). We retrospectively selected this group from the prospectively collected database of 4 centers belonging to the Italian Research Group for Gastric Cancer, and compared them with 437 pT2-4aN0 patients without recurrence (Group 2). We analyzed lymphatic embolization, microvascular infiltration, perineural infiltration, and immunohistochemical determination of p53, Ki67, and HER2 in Group 1 and in a subgroup of Group 2 (Group 2bis) of 41 cases matched with Group 1 according to demographic and pathological characteristics.</p>
<p>RESULTS</p>
<p>T4a stage and diffuse histotype were associated with recurrence in the group of pN0 patients. In-depth pathological analysis of two homogenous groups of pN0 patients, with and without recurrence during longterm follow-up (groups 1 and 2bis), revealed two striking patterns: lymphatic embolization and perineural infiltration (two parameters that pathologists can easily report), and p53 and Ki67, represent significant factors for recurrence.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>The reported pathological features should be considered predictive factors for recurrence and could be useful to stratify node-negative gastric cancer patients for adjuvant treatment and tailored follow-up.</p>"

<p>This paper assesses the role of concentrated bank borrowing in explaining the extensive and intensive margins of export, while accounting for the simultaneous relationship between exporting and innovation. Concentrated bank borrowing proxies for the intensity of the bank-firm relationship and is a strategy often pursued by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in order to overcome information asymmetries and improve access to external finance. Our results show that a tight relationship between an SME and its main bank increases both the firm's probability of exporting and its export intensity. This positive effect is only marginally mediated by the SME's increased propensity to introduce product innovation. We further discuss the financial and non-financial channels through which the intensity of the bank-firm relationship supports SMEs' international activities.</p>"

<p>Population movements will help people cope with the impacts of climate change. However, large-scale displacements may also produce security risks for receiving areas. If climate change intensifies the process of out-migration, destination countries may face waves of migrants so large and fast that integration becomes increasingly hard. The objective of this article is to empirically estimate if the inflows of climate-induced migrants increase the risk of conflicts in receiving areas. Using data from 1960 to 2000, we show that climate-induced migrants are not an additional determinant of civil conflicts and civil wars in receiving areas. (JEL Codes: Q54, F22, Q34, H56).</p>"
