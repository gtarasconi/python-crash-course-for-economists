Dear all

The Python class will use an interactive tool called "Jupyter notebooks" that lets you follow along in the slides, as 
well as write and execute your own code. To use these notebooks, you will have to install Anaconda Python and make sure 
it is running.

You need to execute the following steps *before* the first lecture:

- download Anaconda with Python 3.7 (or altest version) for your operating system from

https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

- install Anaconda and make it your system Python

- open the Jupyter Notebook app either by
 - opening the Anaconda Navigator app and clicking on "Jupyter Notebook" or
 - opening a terminal window and typing "jupyter notebook"

- this will give you a browser window with a file structure. Make sure you know where on your computer this folder is!

- download the attached file (Our first notebook.ipynb) and copy it into a folder that you can reach from the Jupyter 

Notebook window

- open the downloaded file in the Notebook window [in windows you can download it under documents and browse from Jupyter 
to find it]
- execute the code in the notebook (how-to instructions there)

You should see an encouraging message if all is working correctly.
